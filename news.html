            <p>
                Hasni, who refused to divulge his next course of action, said as a person who wanted the party to be dominant in Johor, he would not just be sitting around and doing nothing after his removal as state Umno chairman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasni, who has headed the state committee since 2018, said that he took over the helm when Umno was in the opposition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I hope our new chairman Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin will be able to call for a meeting soon to discuss the latest developments in the party," he said, adding that he was still an Umno supreme council member
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasni reminded his party leadership that whatever decision made in Umno should not be at the expense of giving an edge to other parties who were already wooing some of the leaders who were sacked or suspended

            <p>
                Hasni, who refused to divulge his next course of action, said as a person who wanted the party to be dominant in Johor, he would not just be sitting around and doing nothing after his removal as state Umno chairman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasni, who has headed the state committee since 2018, said that he took over the helm when Umno was in the opposition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I hope our new chairman Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin will be able to call for a meeting soon to discuss the latest developments in the party," he said, adding that he was still an Umno supreme council member
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasni reminded his party leadership that whatever decision made in Umno should not be at the expense of giving an edge to other parties who were already wooing some of the leaders who were sacked or suspended

                Meor Azuan Hassan celebrates Shello Silverius' goal during their game against Japan at the Birsa Munda Stadium in Rourkela
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wily midfielder Shello Silverius was the toast with two goals in the seventh and 31st minute to end his World Cup campaign with three goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan's goals were scored by Kaito Tanaka (23rd minute) and Seren Tanaka (31st)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means Malaysia will end their World Cup in 13th, an improvement compared to their 2018 outing, where they were booted out of the group stages and finished 15th.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 28 — The real threat to the survival of the ethnic Malay community and Malaysia as a whole is corruption as well as leaders who steal the country’s wealth, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today

            <p>
                It's a way and attempt by political leaders to disguise and hijack the central issues of governance in this country

            <p>
                The Malay survival is being threatened by a corrupt system, a greedy coterie of leaders who have been stealing public funds from this country, so we will have to continue to work together to make sure we save this country from corruption,” he said in his keynote speech at the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia's (ACCCIM) Chinese New Year open house here

                Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old black man who was pulled over while driving and died three days later, is detained by Memphis Police Department officers on Jan 7, 2023, in this screengrab from a video released by Memphis Police Department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A separate video shows a subsequent struggle after officers catch up with Nichols again, and are beating him

            <p>
                The officers, all black, had already been dismissed from the police department last Saturday following their Jan 7 confrontation with Nichols after pulling him over
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Nichols' family, said the last words on the video were Nichols crying out for his mother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Antonio Romanucci, another lawyer for Nichols' family, told National Public Radio in an interview on Friday that Nichols was a strong supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and "basically died for his own cause"

                Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old black man who was pulled over while driving and died three days later, is detained by Memphis Police Department officers on Jan 7, 2023, in this screengrab from a video released by Memphis Police Department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A separate video shows a subsequent struggle after officers catch up with Nichols again, and are beating him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The officers, all black, had already been dismissed from the police department last Saturday following their Jan 7 confrontation with Nichols after pulling him over
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Nichols' family, said the last words on the video were Nichols crying out for his mother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Antonio Romanucci, another lawyer for Nichols' family, told National Public Radio in an interview on Friday that Nichols was a strong supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and "basically died for his own cause"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police have described the circumstances of Nichols' arrest in vague terms

                There is no age cap on your ability to convert to a Roth

                According to SkyscrapersMY, the above building with a rectangular dome is the upcoming Apple Store in Malaysia

            <p>
                Apple is keeping its new retail store plans under wraps and we can’t confirm if this is indeed the upcoming store
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the building on the right is a double-storey structure which could be somewhat similar to the Apple Central World store in Thailand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the new retail store opens in TRX later this year, it will make Malaysia the 3rd market in Southeast Asia to get an official Apple Store
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Malaysia, the closest thing we have to an actual Apple Store is an Apple Premium Partner Store located at Pavilion KL

                According to SkyscrapersMY, the above building with a rectangular dome is the upcoming Apple Store in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple is keeping its new retail store plans under wraps and we can’t confirm if this is indeed the upcoming store
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the building on the right is a double-storey structure which could be somewhat similar to the Apple Central World store in Thailand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the new retail store opens in TRX later this year, it will make Malaysia the 3rd market in Southeast Asia to get an official Apple Store
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Malaysia, the closest thing we have to an actual Apple Store is an Apple Premium Partner Store located at Pavilion KL
            </p>

                On January 18, 2023, BMW of North America announced a safety recall for all 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP motorcycles due to the potential risk of a broken gearbox input shaft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This could, in turn, block the rear wheel, which could increase the risk of a crash.  According to BMW, approximately 18,489 motorcycles are involved in this recall, which represents 100 percent of the population
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BMW intensified its analysis of the issue, and eventually determined that if there is an abrupt difference between the engine speed and the rotational speed of the final drive component, the gearbox input shaft could become overloaded, and break as a result
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s why BMW decided to issue this recall.  Owners will be notified via postal mail that they should stop riding their affected bikes and contact their local authorized BMW dealer for recall service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BMW has also issued a Stop Sale notice to its dealers for all affected 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP bikes until recall service has been performed.  BMW North America notified its dealer network about this recall on January 18, 2023

            <p>
                Raman, who was unrepresented, asked for bail, saying he had to look after his mother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I hope the court can grant me bail as I need to take my mother to her hospital appointments,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Raman also asked for a low bail, claiming he only earned about RM1,000 a month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Magistrate Norshazwani then set bail at RM16,000 with two sureties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The case will be mentioned again at the Bahau Magistrate’s Court on Feb 22

                Public health expert Prof Dr Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia said the high number of deaths was unavoidable at one point as there was a severe health resource shortage and a lack of facilities, as well as proper isolation centres

                Universiti Malaya professor of epidemiology and public health Prof Dr Sanjay Rampal said while the Health Ministry responded well to the initial pandemic, future resilience would be highly dependent on investments in public health and healthcare systems

                Aulas closing the door on a potential move could be seen as him trying to put pressure on Chelsea to increase their first offer and agree to let Gusto stay at Lyon on loan until the end of the season, which Chelsea have refused to agree to so far in the negotiations

                Gusto has now played 47 times already with Lyon, his hometown club, including some European games and he is also on Didier Deschamps' radar for the national team after having represented France in every youth team

                It seems that Moscow has been expecting the provision of Western tanks to Ukraine for some time, considering the recent appointment of Russian Chief of Staff General Valery Gerasimov, a tank expert, as the Ukraine war commander, perhaps in anticipation of an imminent ‘tank war’ in Ukraine

                Also, Russian-language reports recommend hitting the fuel tank, located in the front section on both sides of the driver

            <p>
                For example, in October 2003, an Abrams tank was disabled by an anti-tank mine in Iraq, combined with other explosives and several 155mm artillery rounds to increase its effect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The explosion underneath the tank knocked off the turret and resulted in the death of two American soldiers, marking the first time deaths had occurred from a hostile assault on the M1 tank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, Russia would do well to factor in foot infantry in Ukrainian tank assaults, considering Ukraine has learned from the Russian mistake

                One way to start is to cut back on extra fat in your diet, especially the saturated type
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Excess fat turns into body fat very easily
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you do eat fat, focus on the monounsaturated type (MUFA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Studies have shown that a diet high in this type of fat can help reduce the accumulation of fat in the liver

                Anwar also backed suggestions by scholars that Islamic civilisation be taught at every level

                The scholar, widely regarded as an essential public intellectual, and a pioneer in Islamic civilisational studies, told Anwar that the entire Islamic education syllabus must be reviewed and reformed

            <p>
                “We must also be wary of forced goals in top universities in Malaysia as they must have both soul and excellence

            <p>
                To enable a smooth movement in his official capacity as the Deputy Prime Minister, Ahmad Zahid said he was required to be in and out of the country and this would necessitate him holding his own passport

            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid also said that his travel document was needed, as it was required for him to apply for a diplomatic passport for official business inside and outside of the country

            <p>

                Elon Musk sees the toughest competition for Tesla in China, home of the company he expects “most likely to be second” in electric vehicles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China is Tesla Inc’s second-largest market — accounted for about two-thirds of all electric vehicles sales globally in 2022 — and the home of Tesla’s biggest plant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked about Tesla’s competition, Musk responded that he respected car companies in China, calling it the most competitive market in the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Musk did not identify any Chinese automakers by name

            <p>
                “And so we guess, there is probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla.” Tesla recently promoted China chief Tom Zhu to run US factories and sales in North America and Europe, Reuters has reported

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 26 — Any “madani” concept for the advancement of civil society must properly follow the precepts of Islam to succeed, according to PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a Facebook post this morning, the Islamist said the word “madani” is derived from the Quran, and its concepts and practice must follow the tenets of Islam

            <p>
                He stressed that the gathering of Muslims and non-Muslims living together as a plural society in the Arabic city of Medina proves the success of the “madani” concept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He suggested that for Malaysia to similarly succeed in this model, it should follow the established Islamic practice

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 26 — Despite its explanation, the Education Ministry continued to come under fire from some parents of the SMK Infant Jesus Convent in Johor over a workshop for students who will be sitting for their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a joint statement, eight members of the secondary school’s parent-teacher association (PTA) asserted that there were discrepancies between the ministry’s explanations and what they had been told by SMK Infant Jesus Convent’s principal Ande Noor Munawarah Bachok, news portal The Vibes reported today

                According to The Telegraph, Arsenal are actively showing interest in Caicedo as the club considers midfield options

            <p>
                An ideal alternative to Moises Caicedo would be Amadou Onana

                It's believed Onana was on the Gunners' radar prior to his move to Merseyside, but again, he would not come cheaply

            <p>
                Regardless of what happens in midfield, Arsenal beating the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Newcastle to land one of the hottest prospects in football would be an exciting piece of business in the remaining days of the window

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 26 — Any “madani” concept for the advancement of civil society must properly follow the precepts of Islam to succeed, according to PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a Facebook post this morning, the Islamist said the word “madani” is derived from the Quran, and its concepts and practice must follow the tenets of Islam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A civil society model that is not based on the model of Allah and the Messenger of God will surely lead to the same failure as the previous civilisation and the modern civilisation that is burning itself now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He stressed that the gathering of Muslims and non-Muslims living together as a plural society in the Arabic city of Medina proves the success of the “madani” concept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He suggested that for Malaysia to similarly succeed in this model, it should follow the established Islamic practice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 19, Anwar introduced his “Malaysia Madani” blueprint as a new narrative for the nation going forward

            <p>
                In a Facebook post this morning, the Islamist said the word “madani” is derived from the Quran, and its concepts and practice must follow the tenets of Islam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A civil society model that is not based on the model of Allah and the Messenger of God will surely lead to the same failure as the previous civilisation and the modern civilisation that is burning itself now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He stressed that the gathering of Muslims and non-Muslims living together as a plural society in the Arabic city of Medina proves the success of the “madani” concept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He suggested that for Malaysia to similarly succeed in this model, it should follow the established Islamic practice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 19, Anwar introduced his “Malaysia Madani” blueprint as a new narrative for the nation going forward

                Police officers aiding flood evacuees in Kota Marudu, Sabah on Jan 26, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of 12pm on Thursday (Jan 26), Malaysia’s National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) recorded 5,528 flood victims in Johor and 6,331 flood victims in Sabah.  This is an increase from the 3,937 flood victims in Johor recorded by the agency 24 hours prior.  Bernama reported that 55 relief centres have been opened in Johor as of 8am on Thursday to house the flood evacuees
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Segamat was the most affected district in Johor, followed by Kluang and Mersing, according to the state disaster management committee on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Sabah has seen more than 6,000 new flood evacuees in just a day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Bernama, 26 flood relief centres were opened as of 8am on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last month, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who is the Central Disaster Management Committee chairman, called for immediate long-term measures to resolve the country’s flood problem, including holistic flood mitigation projects.  Ahmad Zahid said that such flood management efforts, when completed, could ensure good long-term flood management until 2100

                Latest Arsenal news takes a closer look at how Mohamed Elneny's injury setback could affect Mikel Arteta's plans leading up to transfer deadline day and the remainder of the season Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters The one downside coming out of Mikel Arteta's press conference ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup fourth round tie against Manchester City was the Mohamed Elneny injury update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But let’s see."  Whilst Elneny is by no means a regular under Arteta, he has proven to be a decent backup option for Thomas Partey at the base of Arsenal's midfield over the past six to eight months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One option, of course, is dipping into the transfer market before next Tuesday's deadline and Arteta himself has publicly stated that in an ideal world, he will be able to sign a midfielder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Well, we need some more cover in midfield ideally if we can," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having to rest Thomas today, I think it was a good option."  Hopefully, Elneny's injury isn't too serious and is available for selection soon

                Latest Arsenal news takes a closer look at how Mohamed Elneny's injury setback could affect Mikel Arteta's plans leading up to transfer deadline day and the remainder of the season Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters The one downside coming out of Mikel Arteta's press conference ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup fourth round tie against Manchester City was the Mohamed Elneny injury update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But let’s see."  Whilst Elneny is by no means a regular under Arteta, he has proven to be a decent backup option for Thomas Partey at the base of Arsenal's midfield over the past six to eight months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One option, of course, is dipping into the transfer market before next Tuesday's deadline and Arteta himself has publicly stated that in an ideal world, he will be able to sign a midfielder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Well, we need some more cover in midfield ideally if we can," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having to rest Thomas today, I think it was a good option."  Hopefully, Elneny's injury isn't too serious and is available for selection soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in the event that he is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines and Arsenal don't manage to sign a replacement before the January transfer window closes then all signs point towards Arteta revisiting the Lokonga experiment as cover for Partey

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 25 — The police cautioned the public today against joining two planned marches to the Swedish embassy here on Friday as both would violate public assembly laws
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The police did not receive any notification of assembly from any party to hold any assembly as provided under Section 9 (1) of the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Assembly without notification is an offence under Section 9 (5) of the same Act,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the police, one march was scheduled for approximately 8.30am this coming Friday, from the Tabung Haji Mosque to the Swedish Embassy in Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other was scheduled for about 2pm the same day, after the compulsory Muslim Friday prayers, marching from the As-Syakirin KLCC Mosque to the embassy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Swedish authorities have said the act did not violate any of the country’s laws

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 25 — The police cautioned the public today against joining two planned marches to the Swedish embassy here on Friday as both would violate public assembly laws
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The police did not receive any notification of assembly from any party to hold any assembly as provided under Section 9 (1) of the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Assembly without notification is an offence under Section 9 (5) of the same Act,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the police, one march was scheduled for approximately 8.30am this coming Friday, from the Tabung Haji Mosque to the Swedish Embassy in Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other was scheduled for about 2pm the same day, after the compulsory Muslim Friday prayers, marching from the As-Syakirin KLCC Mosque to the embassy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Swedish authorities have said the act did not violate any of the country’s laws

            <p>
                "Next would be to ensure the welfare and health of flood victims through the involvement of the Social Welfare Department and the state Health Department,” Armizan said

                As of 2pm, the number of flood victims in Johor alone increased to 4,207 people from 1,164 families currently placed in 45 temporary relief centers in Segamat, Muar, Kluang, Kota Tinggi, Batu Pahat and Mersing

                About Us Advertise   NEW YORK, Jan 25 ― A woman in New York state has filed a civil suit against Mike Tyson, accusing the former boxing champion of raping her in a limousine in the early 1990s, according to court filings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The woman, who asked the court to remain anonymous, filed her complaint in early January under a temporary New York state law allowing victims of sexual assault to seek civil damages regardless of the statute of limitations

            <p>
                Tyson spent three years in jail beginning in 1992 after being found guilty of raping model Desiree Washington, who was 18 at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As a result of Tyson's rape, I suffered and continue to suffer from physical, psychological and emotional injury,” she said

                By late Tuesday, Tyson had not issued any public statement

                Stocks went on to surge as much as 52% after the July 2020 golden cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The indicator can help alert traders to securities in the stock market that are solidifying their uptrend and are likely to experience a continuation with higher stock prices.  In December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average flashed the golden cross signal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The opposite signal to the golden cross is the "death cross," which is a sell signal that triggers when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He found that on average, stocks were higher three months after a golden cross 62% of the time, and higher six months after the golden cross 64% of the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average three-month return when stocks were higher after a golden cross was 7.33%, while the average return six months after the golden cross was 10.65%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stressing the importance that moving average crossover signals are not perfect, Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co., said of The Chart Report, "All big rallies start with a golden cross, but not all golden crosses lead to a big rally." The golden cross signal is one of many trading patterns that technical analysts employ to buy stocks. Meanwhile, the bearish death cross is in addition to many trading patterns that traders use to sell stocks.

                Even a new year can't shake the bearishness from GMO's Jeremy Grantham, who said in a Tuesday letter that the stock market will drop another 20% this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Grantham said the ongoing deterioration of financial conditions will be capped off by a downturn in the housing market, representing the "final phase" of the stock market bubble that should help drive the S&P 500 to 3,200 by year-end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So you shouldn't be tempted to think its absolutely cannot happen," Grantham warned.  The key to whether or not Grantham's bleak scenario plays out this year hinges on investor confidence, which was on a slow yet steady decline throughout 2022 as every rally in stocks ended up being sold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The debt ceiling is another overhang for investors this year.  "Almost any pin can prick such supreme confidence and cause the first quick and severe decline," Grantham said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's because in 1929, 2000, and 2007, the largest part of the stock market decline occurred after the first rate cut from the Fed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Grantham does take comfort in the fact that corporate earnings estimates have yet to significantly decline despite all of the bearish possibilities.  "But still I'd prefer a lot more optimism, which a year ago was nearly universal," Grantham said.

                As Mohammed Salisu hacked clear, there were a queue of Newcastle players waiting but Joelinton seemed to control with his arm before his shot found the net and ref Stuart Attwell ruled it out.  Pope was soon forced into an improvised save from a fizzing, swerving low drive from Carlos Alcaraz.  And Pope, suddenly busy, had to dart out of his area to clear from Moussa Djenepro, thudding into the Saints winger as he did so but escaping punishment despite the howls of the home players and supporters

            <p>
                After the break, Almiron was leaving scorched earth down the left flank again but when he cut back, Sean Longstaff cleared the bar, the theme for Newcastle’s evening
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Almiron’s pace and trickery bewildered the Saints defence but after his low centre located Joelinton six yards out, the Brazilian somehow shot over despite attempting to side-foot, rather than blast it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alcaraz, who can definitely play a bit, released Che Adams but the sub almost had too much time to think and shot too close to Pope, who stuck out a foot to save.  This was more like it from Southampton and soon Adams forced a sprawling save from Pope.  But then Alexander Isak, just on for Callum Wilson, beat his man down the right and centred low for Joelinton to finally end his frustration from two yards as the Geordies cavorted behind him

                “As for now, the (chicken) supply is stable and we hope it will continue to stabilise,” he was quoted as saying by NST, adding that members of the public are able to buy chicken readily.  Mr Mohamad’s comments on Wednesday were in response to an Utusan Malaysia report which claimed that the country is expected to face a serious food security issue as the domestic chicken supply is predicted to shrink by 40 per cent in June this year.  This would be equivalent to a shortage of about 900,000 chickens per day in the domestic market.  The report stated that the potential shortage is due to the bird flu outbreak in the northern hemisphere.  The report added that European countries as well as the US have already begun to implement export restrictions on breeder chickens, also known as parent stock, due to the bird flu epidemic
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Last year, nearly 50 million birds were culled in Europe due to the risks of bird flu

                Alcaraz, who can definitely play a bit, released Che Adams but the sub almost had too much time to think and shot too close to Pope, who stuck out a foot to save.  This was more like it from Southampton and soon Adams forced a sprawling save from Pope.  But then Alexander Isak, just on for Callum Wilson, beat his man down the right and centred low for Joelinton to finally end his frustration from two yards as the Geordies cavorted behind him

                Stocks went on to surge as much as 52% after the July 2020 golden cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The indicator can help alert traders to securities in the stock market that are solidifying their uptrend and are likely to experience a continuation with higher stock prices.  In December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average flashed the golden cross signal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The opposite signal to the golden cross is the "death cross," which is a sell signal that triggers when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He found that on average, stocks were higher three months after a golden cross 62% of the time, and higher six months after the golden cross 64% of the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average three-month return when stocks were higher after a golden cross was 7.33%, while the average return six months after the golden cross was 10.65%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stressing the importance that moving average crossover signals are not perfect, Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co., said of The Chart Report, "All big rallies start with a golden cross, but not all golden crosses lead to a big rally." The golden cross signal is one of many trading patterns that technical analysts employ to buy stocks. Meanwhile, the bearish death cross is in addition to many trading patterns that traders use to sell stocks.

                (Bloomberg) -- China invoked the US’s brinkmanship over its own debt limit as it hit back at Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s criticism of Beijing’s handling of debt issues in developing countries

                China has become the world’s biggest creditor to developing countries, some of which are facing a mounting debt crisis

                Many Google employees were having a normal day on Jan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then suddenly that morning Google’s parent, Alphabet, announced that it was cutting 12,000 jobs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justin Moore had worked at Google for more than 16 years, according to his LinkedIn profile, before he was laid off last Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                A Google product manager, Manas Minglani, who was impacted by the layoffs wrote that he couldn’t say his goodbyes

                Google’s most recent quarterly earnings, announced in October, missed analyst expectations

                Leandro Trossard's Arsenal switch has been earned says his former Genk teammate Thomas Buffel but strong self-belief will remain a potential factor in any managerial disagreements

            <p>
                He has good feet, and he can play and link up so I think he can be a good player for Arsenal." Trossard was at Genk from 2012 through to 2019 and so spent six years at the Belgian side with Buffel who left in 2018 after nine years himself

            <p>
                Although the teams are the same in the league, how they approach Arsenal compared to Brighton creates different tests but Buffel believes that Trossard will not have a problem with this

                Tomi has been playing left centre-back for the Japan national team, when you look at his games, he is great," the Spaniard said earlier in the season

                It’s great that players are comfortable in more than one position." These comments and the fact Tomiyasu was told to warm up instead of Holding when Gabriel required treatment against Brentford back in September were, at the time, seen as the clearest 'confirmation' yet that the £18m signing from Bologna in the summer of 2021 was now the back-up left-sided centre-back option

            <p>
                And now with the signing of Kiwior, it effectively confirms that Tomiyasu's role for the remainder of the season will be as a full-back, whether that's competing with Ben White on the right-hand side or Oleksandr Zinchenko and Kieran Tierney on the opposite flank

                During the club's 3-2 defeat away to Arsenal on Sunday, Antony was unceremoniously hooked off in the 71st minute for Fred

                New Manchester United winger Antony has failed to impress during his time so far at the club Antony (L) scored on his Premier League debut during United's win over Arsenal in September Since then, the Brazilian has struggled to find form and was hooked off during Sunday's defeat Like with every newcomer to the English top-flight, there is a fair argument that the 22-year-old needs to be given reasonable time to adjust to the demands of playing in what many consider the toughest league in the world, but patience amongst United fans and former players is running out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Antony's arrival was an admission that the club had got it wrong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Scoring on his debut in United's 3-1 win over Arsenal near the start of the season, Antony went on to score in his next two league games, but since then highlights have been few and far between as the Brazilian struggled to build on bright moments

            <p>
                Club legend Rio Ferdinand questioned Antony's quality following Sunday's defeat at Arsenal He needs to improve quickly with the impending return of Jadon Sancho bringing competition His trademark spin combined with blistering pace and an array of skills typical of Brazilian wingers means Antony has all the hallmarks to be a success in England's north-west.  But he needs to start demonstrating the qualities that first earned him a move to the club or else faces the exit door
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The impending return of Sancho only heaps more pressure on Antony to start producing the goods for Man United with the club still realistically in the hunt for the Premier League title, but if improvement isn't seen soon then it would be no surprise to see Ten Hag drop the star and head back to the transfer market

                Bukit Aman Traffic Investigation and Enforcement Department (JSPT) director Comm Datuk Seri Mat Kasim Karim said the department expects traffic to reach two million vehicles on the North-South Expressway (NSE), 150,000 vehicles on the East Coast Expressway 1 (LPT1) and 200,000 vehicles on the Kuala Lumpur-Karak route on Tuesday (Jan 24)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As of noon, traffic on the North-South Expressway reached 1.18 million vehicles followed by 115,158 vehicles on LPT1 and 160,000 along Kuala Lumpur-Karak," he said in a statement
            </p>

                Via Manchester Evening News, ten Hag said his players 'have to change their mentality' if they want to be successful, after admitting he was 'annoyed' by the defeat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag has criticised Manchester United's defending in their recent defeat tot Arsenal United were unable to hold out for a draw after they conceded a late winner from forward Eddie Nketiah 'Maybe in the next couple of hours we realise we are in a good position, realise we are in a good development, a good process, but at this moment I am annoyed,' the Dutchman said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'I also told the players if you want to win trophies, titles, we have to change our mentality
            </p>
            
            <p>

                (Bloomberg) -- Ken Griffin’s Citadel churned out a record $16 billion in profit for clients last year, outperforming the rest of the industry and one of history’s most successful financial plays
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citadel’s gain was the largest annual return for a hedge fund manager, surpassing the $15 billion that John Paulson generated in 2007 on his bet against subprime mortgages

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The findings also reflect the growing clout of multistrategy hedge fund firms, which are on the cusp of taking over equity-focused funds to become the dominant strategy in the industry

                Rio Ferdinand slammed Manchester United winger Antony for his performance versus Arsenal  Ferdinand was speaking on his show FIVE - after his old side fell to a 3-2 defeat at the Emirates ‘He just doesn’t beat anyone and I’m sitting there thinking, “Was that always the way?”' Ferdinand said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘I saw Thomas Partey, who I wouldn’t put down as a sprinter, absolutely burst past him, and I’m thinking, “Woah, he (Antony) hasn’t got much power in them legs!” ‘He’s a tricky winger, but with tricky wingers you want them to still be able to beat the defender.' Ferdinand also suggested Luke Shaw (left) was 'scared' of Bukayo Sake (right) during the game Saka scored Arsenal's second goal and was in fine form for Arsenal against the Red Devils Ferdinand then went on to suggest United defender Luke Shaw was 'scared' of Bukayo Saka at the Emirates.  Saka scored Arsenal's second to put his side ahead at the Emirates, and gave his England colleague a tough time on the day with his impressive dribbling and direct running

                The former United defender suggested Saka had Shaw's 'number' on the day, branding the winger his young player of the year so far

            <p>
                Saka made life difficult for England colleague Shaw throughout the afternoon in the capital ‘I think Saka, my young player of the year, had Shaw scared', he said

            <p>
                But Shaw’s been magnificent for United up to this point.’  Though they netted twice in the game, United manager Erik ten Hag berated his side's defending, claiming they have to 'change their mentality' if they want to win trophies

                In the first quarter, Spain had two penalty corners, one in the first minute and the second in the 12th minute
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                In the second quarter, Malaysia looked better in terms of movement and circle penetration, but Spain had the best chance in the 20th minute when Joaquin Menini unleashed a reverse stick shot, which Hafizuddin saved beautifully

                Liverpool is reportedly interested in signing a young defender who fits the FSG model, and has compared himself to Virgil van Dijk — not without reason
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool is still very much keeping an eye on the best prospects from abroad
            </p>

            <p>
                While the BBC has not aired the documentary in India, the video was uploaded on some YouTube channels, Gupta said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                New Delhi has issued orders to Twitter to block over 50 tweets linking to the video of the documentary and YouTube has been instructed to block any uploads of the video, he added

                Modi was the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat when it was gripped by communal riots that left more than 1,000 people dead, by government count - most of them Muslims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Modi was later named the head of his party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which he led to power in general elections in 2014 and then in 2019

                Modi was the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat when it was gripped by communal riots that left more than 1,000 people dead, by government count - most of them Muslims

            <p>
                Modi was later named the head of his party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which he led to power in general elections in 2014 and then in 2019

                "I think Singaporeans can feel that life (has) gone back to normal, but to healthcare workers, it was not normal, it was the most difficult year to have to go through three infection waves," he added

                Singapore saw three COVID-19 waves in 2022 - the BA.2 Omicron subvariant in April, the wave driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants in July, and the recent wave driven by the XBB variant.  "So today on the first day of Chinese New Year, I come here, although just to Sengkang Hospital, but really, it's to carry a message to all our healthcare workers, to thank you, especially for the last year, for all that you have done," Mr Ong said

                Health Minister Ong Ye Kung was at Sengkang General Hospital on the first day of the Chinese New Year to express his appreciation to healthcare staff who are working to keep essential healthcare services running over the holiday period

                Health Minister Ong Ye Kung visited Sengkang General Hospital to welcome the Year of the Rabbit with the staff and patients on Jan 22, 2023

                Mr Ong was at Sengkang General Hospital on the first day of the Chinese New Year to express his appreciation to healthcare staff who are working to keep essential healthcare services running over the holiday period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I think Singaporeans can feel that life (has) gone back to normal, but to healthcare workers, it was not normal, it was the most difficult year to have to go through three infection waves," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Singapore saw three COVID-19 waves in 2022 - the BA.2 Omicron subvariant in April, the wave driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants in July, and the recent wave driven by the XBB variant.  "So today on the first day of Chinese New Year, I come here, although just to Sengkang Hospital, but really, it's to carry a message to all our healthcare workers, to thank you, especially for the last year, for all that you have done," Mr Ong said

                China on Jan 14 reported nearly 60,000 COVID-related deaths in hospitals between Dec 8 and Jan 12, a huge increase from the 5,000-plus deaths reported previously over the entire pandemic period

                Chinese health experts say the wave of infections across the country has already peaked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China on Jan 14 reported nearly 60,000 COVID-related deaths in hospitals between Dec 8 and Jan 12, a huge increase from the 5,000-plus deaths reported previously over the entire pandemic period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some health experts expect that more than one million people will die from the disease in China this year, with British-based health data firm Airfinity forecasting COVID-19 fatalities could hit 36,000 a day this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                About 110 million railway passenger trips are estimated to have been made during Jan 7 to 21, the first 15 days of the 40-day Chinese New Year travel rush, up 28 per cent year-on-year, People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper reported
