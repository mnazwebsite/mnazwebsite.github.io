                An unredacted version filed over the weekend in federal court in Oakland, California, offers details about how much engineers and others, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, knew about the harms of social media and their misgivings about it

                Both sides are watching closely a Supreme Court case that will likely determine the fate of the litigation in Oakland

            <p>
                According to the new filing, internal documents at TikTok parent ByteDance show that the company knows young people are more susceptible to being lured into trying dangerous stunts they view on the platform – known as viral challenges – because their ability to weigh risk isn’t fully formed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Young people are more likely to "overestimate their ability to cope with risk,” and their "ability to understand the finality of death is also not fully fledged,” according to the filing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another unsealed portion of the filing contends that instead of moving to address the problems around children using Instagram and Facebook, Meta defunded its mental health team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These affect everyone, especially Youth and Creators; if not addressed, these will follow us into the Metaverse.” Snap and Meta had no immediate comment on the court filing

                According to the new filing, internal documents at TikTok parent ByteDance show that the company knows young people are more susceptible to being lured into trying dangerous stunts they view on the platform – known as viral challenges – because their ability to weigh risk isn’t fully formed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Young people are more likely to "overestimate their ability to cope with risk,” and their "ability to understand the finality of death is also not fully fledged,” according to the filing

                Another unsealed portion of the filing contends that instead of moving to address the problems around children using Instagram and Facebook, Meta defunded its mental health team

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 14 — Former finance minister Lim Guan Eng today said that he will take legal action against former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin if the latter does not apologise and withdraw his statement regarding Lim’s involvement in the Albukhary Foundation issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim said Muhyiddin has failed to produce evidence for his statement that Lim, as then finance minister, had evoked the tax-exempt status of Albukhary Foundation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also pointed out that Muhyiddin’s statements were inflammatory and seditious as they imply that a non-Muslim minister had revoked the tax-exempt status of a Muslim charitable organisation

            <p>
                At a press conference outside the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) headquarters in Putrajaya on March 9, Muhyiddin claimed Lim had revoked the tax exemption for Yayasan Albukhary as the finance minister of the first Pakatan Harapan administration

                Banking experts have been among those alarmed at the rapid collapse of SVB, the country’s 16th biggest bank by assets and how its demise became a harbinger of Sunday’s failure of another lender, Signature Bank

                But that shift in law does not excuse regulators for these failures, according to Anna Gelpern, a law professor at Georgetown University

                “If this was clearly unsafe and unsound behaviour,” the banks’ official designation in the law “does not excuse a failure of supervision,” she said

            <p>
                Michael Ohlrogge, an associate professor of law at New York University, said regulators as a matter of course assign “very little to zero-risk weight” in terms of bank capital requirements for Treasury-linked securities because they are considered safe

            </p>
            
            <p>

                This follows the Court of Appeal on Tuesday (March 14) dismissing the appeal by lawyer R Kengadharan, who challenged the imposition of a departure levy by the then Pakatan Harapan government in 2019, for Malaysians wanting to travel overseas

                The one that is getting the most attention here is Mason Mount
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has been one of the club's top performers since his debut in 2019 but there is a current contract stand-off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea will not tread the line and take a risk in the last 12 months of his contract, that only opens them up to losing him for free in the summer of 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mount's situation is comparable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given the quality he has shown for the club across three and a half seasons it would be a remarkable shock and shame for Chelsea to lose him, even for what would be a hefty sum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To lose that sense of the club at a time where an unprecedented level of change has already happen would be a big blow

                The one that is getting the most attention here is Mason Mount
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has been one of the club's top performers since his debut in 2019 but there is a current contract stand-off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea will not tread the line and take a risk in the last 12 months of his contract, that only opens them up to losing him for free in the summer of 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mount's situation is comparable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given the quality he has shown for the club across three and a half seasons it would be a remarkable shock and shame for Chelsea to lose him, even for what would be a hefty sum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To lose that sense of the club at a time where an unprecedented level of change has already happen would be a big blow

                Judge Datuk Christopher Chin Soo Yin handed down the sentence on Loi Kwong Kiat, 53, after ruling there was clear evidence that the accused had engaged in the sale of narcotics

                After federal officials acted on Sunday, he said the government “did the right thing.”Another effect of the banking crisis could be on the Fed’s monetary policy

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 — Opposition Leader Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin’s statement about him having many files on government party leaders from his time as home minister, is a serious matter and should be given appropriate attention, the Dewan Rakyat was told today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (JPM) (Law and Institutional Reform) Ramkarpal Singh said the investigation into the matter can only be done if a report was made for the police to open an investigation paper
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Since the statement was made yesterday, I believe a report to the police or even to MACC (Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission) is needed before any investigation can be done

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Minister in JPM (Sabah, Sarawak Affairs and Special Functions) Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali said the proposal to upgrade the Sabah and Sarawak Affairs Division under the JPM as a full ministry should take into account various aspects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The budget was for operating expenditures of agencies under the JPM, such as the Parliament (RM166,731,200), Election Commission (RM65,543,300) and Public Service Commission (RM42,380,200)
            </p>

            <p>
                Azam, 59, filed the suit against Lalitha, 50, on Jan 12 last year over a defamatory article published by the Independent News Service (INS) news agency portal related to a purchase of shares

            <p>
                The defamation suit was previously set to be heard on Jan 8 to 11 next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam claimed that the articles were sensational, scandalous and offensive and were written and republished with malicious intent to give a bad perception to the readers that the plaintiff was a corrupt civil servant or one who has abused his position as a senior MACC official for his or his sibling’s interests
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Lalitha through her statement of defence filed on Feb 3 last year, claimed that the contents of the articles and her tweets involving Azam were obtained from legitimate sources

                looks so much better than the busy acia front end tho Many will bash Perodua Axia and says get this over the Axia instead while the Toyota cousin don’t ever have ADAS at all

                Like other Peroduas, i personally prefer Perodua’s front ends over Toyota and Daihatsu counterparts but unforturnately all three Axia, Ayla and Agya have ugly read ends

                Ito served as honorary chairman of Seven & i Holdings, which operates about 80,000 stores worldwide, including 7-Eleven shops and the Speedway convenience store chain in the United States
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Management expert Peter Drucker called Ito "one of the world's outstanding entrepreneurs and business builders" in a  biography posted by the Drucker School of Management, to which Ito was a major donor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company dates back to 1920 when Ito's uncle opened a clothing store named Yokado in Tokyo, and the group reorganised under the Seven & I brand in 2005
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Seven & I said last week it would close 14 Ito-Yokado supermarkets in Japan and fully exit from the apparel business as part of a structural reform plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Analysts have said a full divestiture of the Ito-Yokado chain was unlikely as long as the founder Ito was still alive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It is quite possible that the founder could be the only fellow who wants to keep Ito-Yokado under Seven & I's wing," said Oshadhi Kumarsasiri, an analyst at Lightstream Research who publishes on the Smartkarma platform.

                Ito served as honorary chairman of Seven & i Holdings, which operates about 80,000 stores worldwide, including 7-Eleven shops and the Speedway convenience store chain in the United States
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Management expert Peter Drucker called Ito "one of the world's outstanding entrepreneurs and business builders" in a  biography posted by the Drucker School of Management, to which Ito was a major donor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company dates back to 1920 when Ito's uncle opened a clothing store named Yokado in Tokyo, and the group reorganised under the Seven & I brand in 2005
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Seven & I said last week it would close 14 Ito-Yokado supermarkets in Japan and fully exit from the apparel business as part of a structural reform plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Analysts have said a full divestiture of the Ito-Yokado chain was unlikely as long as the founder Ito was still alive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It is quite possible that the founder could be the only fellow who wants to keep Ito-Yokado under Seven & I's wing," said Oshadhi Kumarsasiri, an analyst at Lightstream Research who publishes on the Smartkarma platform.

                Touch n’ Go (TnG) has unveiled a new feature for its mobile eWallet that aims to make paying for your parking more seamless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the new tool, you can just scan the QR code in your eWallet to enter and exit a parking lot without needing a physical ticket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just like the latter, there aren’t any surcharges to use the QR code method to pay for parking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the company, you only need to tap on the “Pay” function when you launch the eWallet app to have it scanned at entry and exit points of supported parking lots
            </p>

                For NFL stars and those of us sitting and watching football at home, one of the first steps to financial security is “understanding your cash flow deeply,” according to Mike Olivia, a registered financial advisor with the NFL
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s essential to know how much money you have coming in, how much you’re spending, how much goes to debt and taxes, and how much you have left over for saving and investing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Olivia said he encourages NFL players to “run their career as if it's a business,” which means they need to understand financial statements like the balance sheet, income statements, cash flow, and equity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With professional athletes, because they’re generating so much of their lifetime earnings in a short period of time, they may be able to save 80% of that income,” Olivia explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With that much money tied up in savings, NFL stars can really capitalize on compound interest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like the NFL star, you might want to consider expenditures you can say no to

                Gab Marcotti explains why LaLiga have to leave the investigation to the Spanish authorities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gavi, 18, signed a new contract at Camp Nou in September until 2026 but the Spanish top-flight did not clear the deal because Barca were in excess of their spending limit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                31, a court ordered LaLiga to accept Gavi's registration, with his previous terms due to expire this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ruling said that a failure to do so "would imply the player's free agency and therefore cause serious, irreparable damage to Barca." However, LaLiga said that judgement has now been overturned because Barca missed a deadline, invalidating Gavi's new contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "LaLiga received a notification from the 10th Commercial Court of Barcelona informing of the lifting of the precautionary measures agreed in the Gavi case," LaLiga said in a statement on Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even if he loses his first-team registration, the Spain international will still be able to play for Barca this season under his previous enrolment as a youth-team player

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT PSV Eindhoven director of football Marcel Brands says that Manchester United’s big-money move for Antony last summer was ‘a madness’ and everyone in football knows it

            <p>
                Brands, who was director of football at Everton from 2018-21, could not believe what United had paid for Antony, comparing the transfer fee to the likes of Gabriel Jesus (£45) and Raphinha (£55m) who moved from Manchester City to Arsenal and Leeds to Barcelona respectively last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke has been underwhelmed with the winger so far, but admits that is partly due to the amount of cash it took to bring him to Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘The jury is still out on Antony,’ Yorke told Premier League Odds

            <p>
                ‘With the fee that’s been paid for him, you’d expect him to set the Premier League alight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘I’ll give him a pass for now because of where the team is and how we’re performing, but I do expect a lot more from Antony going forward.’

                Brands, who was director of football at Everton from 2018-21, could not believe what United had paid for Antony, comparing the transfer fee to the likes of Gabriel Jesus (£45) and Raphinha (£55m) who moved from Manchester City to Arsenal and Leeds to Barcelona respectively last year

                Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke has been underwhelmed with the winger so far, but admits that is partly due to the amount of cash it took to bring him to Old Trafford

            <p>

            <p>
                But she emphasized that the situation was much different from the financial crisis almost 15 years ago, which led to bank bailouts to protect the industry

                What I can say is that despite having no money, we can still do a good job

                What I can say is that despite having no money, we can still do a good job

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 — Perikatan Nasional (PN) chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said today he would not retract his allegations against former finance minister Lim Guan Eng that the latter revoked Yayasan Albukhary’s tax exemption status
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin instead told Lim to explain himself, saying Yayasan Albukhary’s request was given approval during Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s time, but when Pakatan Harapan (PH) took office, Lim was finance minister and the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN) was under his ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin, during a press conference outside the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) headquarters in Putrajaya on March 9, alleged that Lim had revoked the tax exemption which was approved for Yayasan Albukhary when Lim was finance minister after the 14th general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim said that when he was finance minister, he had never issued any specific orders to revoke the tax exemption approved by the previous Barisan Nasional government for Yayasan Albukhary

            <p>
                When Muhyiddin didn’t comply, Lim then said he would take him to court if he did not retract his allegations by Wednesday.

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 12 — Perikatan Nasional (PN) chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin has claimed today that no party in Malaysia has the capacity to fund its own campaigning or party programmes without outside financial backing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If [the political parties] say they can find their own money by doing business then that’s okay, but I’m pretty sure a lot of them got money from their supporters, donations, corporate bodies and individuals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There is also a huge probability these political parties got their money from overseas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Can they declare that they have gotten no funds from anyone outside of Malaysia?” Muhyiddin asked when met by a reporter after Bersatu’s fifth annual general meeting today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I believe there are many parties in Malaysia who want to do lots of programmes, but they need money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In February, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) froze Bersatu’s accounts to facilitate investigations under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 12 — Perikatan Nasional (PN) chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin has claimed today that no party in Malaysia has the capacity to fund its own campaigning or party programmes without outside financial backing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If [the political parties] say they can find their own money by doing business then that’s okay, but I’m pretty sure a lot of them got money from their supporters, donations, corporate bodies and individuals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There is also a huge probability these political parties got their money from overseas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Can they declare that they have gotten no funds from anyone outside of Malaysia?” Muhyiddin asked when met by a reporter after Bersatu’s fifth annual general meeting today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I believe there are many parties in Malaysia who want to do lots of programmes, but they need money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In February, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) froze Bersatu’s accounts to facilitate investigations under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001

                Kohli, who used to lead the Indian team, often leaves comments on Gill’s social media posts, which speaks volumes about their bond
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The two were engrossed in a conversation when Kohli jokingly attempted to twist Gill’s arm, amusing everyone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bond between these two is remarkable and have been seen earlier as well

                In its court filing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has said that marriage is accepted "statutorily, religiously and socially” only between a biological man and a biological woman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just a handful of places outside of the West - and only Taiwan in Asia - allow same-sex marriage

                The Indian government’s position on the issue has, however, remained the same since 2020, when a similar stance to oppose same-sex marriages was taken before a lower court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Invoking the idea of family, the Modi government in its affidavit has said that cohabitation of same-sex partners cannot be compared with the "Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children.” At least three lawyers representing the petitioners in the case declined to comment on the government’s affidavit ahead of the court hearing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While stressing the accepted societal norm on the concept of family and marriage, the government has laid down a plethora of statutory provisions of law that will be impacted if registration of same-sex marriages is permitted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The same government had however refrained from taking any position before the court in 2018, when the legal battle for decriminalizing homosexuality was fought

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 — Bersatu president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin is confident that he and his Opposition party will overcome all their current adversities and beat the ruling parties to form the federal government at the next general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Despite all that we are still here, and not only that, we were able to defeat the kleptocratic party called Barisan Nasional and Umno; we broke their 60-year dominance,” he said to rapturous applause from hundreds of Bersatu delegates today

                They judged the party on its values and they appreciate honesty, integrity and a clean party like us,” he added

            <p>
                Muhyiddin said Bersatu members should be proud that its Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition won 74 federal seats out of 222 in GE15, and managed to form the state government in Perlis, which he noted had been a longtime Umno stronghold, and came close to taking control of Perak and Pahang too

            <p>
                Bersatu members from all over the country attended the party’s assembly today to show solidarity with Muhyiddin after he was charged in court with money laundering party funds and corruption last week

                The 75-year-old was Malaysia’s eighth prime minister from February 2020 to August 2021.

                After almost a decade at the club, Roberto Firmino will be moving on from Liverpool at the end of the season upon the expiry of his contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool will be sad to see the loyal servant leave the club, who has become a modern-day legend

            <p>
                He has done everything he can at Liverpool, and with the club in the process of a complete rebuild, it's understandable that Firmino would want to move onto a new challenge knowing he no longer represents the future at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But for the interest of Liverpool and himself, it's going to be important that he makes the right decision

            <p>
                They are also moves that should suit Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More than ever, Liverpool needs a positive transfer story, and Firmino moving to Al Nassr would only be yet more negative reaffirmation of the fate of those who leave the club

                After almost a decade at the club, Roberto Firmino will be moving on from Liverpool at the end of the season upon the expiry of his contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool will be sad to see the loyal servant leave the club, who has become a modern-day legend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has done everything he can at Liverpool, and with the club in the process of a complete rebuild, it's understandable that Firmino would want to move onto a new challenge knowing he no longer represents the future at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But for the interest of Liverpool and himself, it's going to be important that he makes the right decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They are also moves that should suit Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More than ever, Liverpool needs a positive transfer story, and Firmino moving to Al Nassr would only be yet more negative reaffirmation of the fate of those who leave the club
            </p>

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Erik ten Hag has decided on Tottenham forward Harry Kane as his number one target this summer, with Manchester United ready to break their transfer record in order to sign the England captain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United news, exclusives and analysis United’s reliance on Marcus Rashford has been showcased in recent weeks, despite the winger continuing a good rate of goalscoring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But, with Anthony Martial making just 12 appearances this season, United desperately need a centre forward and Ten Hag has been weighing up a move for Kane or Napoli striker Victor Osimhen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Mirror say Ten Hag has decided that Kane is his first choice and he’s asked the United board to fund a club record move for the striker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United’s transfer record remains the £89m they spent on Paul Pogba in 2016 but Tottenham are expected to demand £100m if Kane pushes to leave at the end of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag feels Kane can have a ‘Casemiro’ effect on the side, in that his arrival would immediately take the team to the next level.

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Erik ten Hag has decided on Tottenham forward Harry Kane as his number one target this summer, with Manchester United ready to break their transfer record in order to sign the England captain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United news, exclusives and analysis United’s reliance on Marcus Rashford has been showcased in recent weeks, despite the winger continuing a good rate of goalscoring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But, with Anthony Martial making just 12 appearances this season, United desperately need a centre forward and Ten Hag has been weighing up a move for Kane or Napoli striker Victor Osimhen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Mirror say Ten Hag has decided that Kane is his first choice and he’s asked the United board to fund a club record move for the striker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United’s transfer record remains the £89m they spent on Paul Pogba in 2016 but Tottenham are expected to demand £100m if Kane pushes to leave at the end of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag feels Kane can have a ‘Casemiro’ effect on the side, in that his arrival would immediately take the team to the next level.

                United have been linked with Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane and Napoli’s Victor Omishen, but transfer expert Ekrem Konur says that Robert Firmino might be an option after ‘offering himself’ to the Red Devils
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United would have stiff competition for his signature, as Konur says Firmino has also offered himself to Arsenal, Inter Milan and Barcelona

            <p>
                Firmino is out of contract this summer and failed to agree a new deal, so Liverpool will release him in the coming months

            <p>
                United need a centre-forward and would undoubtedly prefer one with Premier League experience and a good scoring record, so they could do a lot worse than Firmino

                Goals from Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz and Mateo Kovacic helped Chelsea continued their upturn in form with a 3-1 win at Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an action-packed first half, Chelsea's Joao Felix and Leicester's Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall both rattled the woodwork before the Portugal international had a goal ruled out by VAR for offside
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leicester continued to press forward after the equaliser, but it was Chelsea who scored just before half time when Enzo Fernandez played Havertz through with a delicate chip, which the forward lobbed over the head of Ward and into the net
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hosts did not let up in their intensity after the break and were denied an equaliser by a goal line clearance from substitute Conor Gallagher, before Dewsbury-Hall miscued an effort from close range to let Chelsea off the hook
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then we don't get that goal and when they have that quality, they get the chance and score it

                Goals from Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz and Mateo Kovacic helped Chelsea continued their upturn in form with a 3-1 win at Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an action-packed first half, Chelsea's Joao Felix and Leicester's Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall both rattled the woodwork before the Portugal international had a goal ruled out by VAR for offside
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leicester continued to press forward after the equaliser, but it was Chelsea who scored just before half time when Enzo Fernandez played Havertz through with a delicate chip, which the forward lobbed over the head of Ward and into the net
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hosts did not let up in their intensity after the break and were denied an equaliser by a goal line clearance from substitute Conor Gallagher, before Dewsbury-Hall miscued an effort from close range to let Chelsea off the hook
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then we don't get that goal and when they have that quality, they get the chance and score it

                The mostly state-owned energy giant, the world's second most valuable company behind Apple, said in a filing with the Saudi stock market that net income for 2022 was $161.07 billion, up from $110 billion in 2021

                A team of Chinese researchers funded by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) recently claimed to have used artificial intelligence (AI) to design an electrical layout of a warship with 100 percent accuracy and at an unprecedented speed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A team of researchers from the China Ship Design and Research Center, headed by Luo Wei, a senior engineer with the ship design center, published a paper in the Chinese-language journal Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems on February 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Luo’s team compared their AI designer to those developed by companies like Google to increase the speed of computer chip design
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Firstly, the team notes in the paper that there is no room for error in warship design, and the AI chip designer can make a few mistakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team also noted that the AI designer’s effectiveness had only been proven for the layout of electrical systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the issue of a potential future conflict with China, Tangredi says that a naval war against China in the western Pacific in this decade would see a smaller US Naval force against a gigantic PLA Navy, and that too in waters near China, inside the range of PLA’s air and rocket forces

                A team of researchers from the China Ship Design and Research Center, headed by Luo Wei, a senior engineer with the ship design center, published a paper in the Chinese-language journal Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems on February 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Luo’s team compared their AI designer to those developed by companies like Google to increase the speed of computer chip design
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Firstly, the team notes in the paper that there is no room for error in warship design, and the AI chip designer can make a few mistakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team also noted that the AI designer’s effectiveness had only been proven for the layout of electrical systems

            <p>
                On the issue of a potential future conflict with China, Tangredi says that a naval war against China in the western Pacific in this decade would see a smaller US Naval force against a gigantic PLA Navy, and that too in waters near China, inside the range of PLA’s air and rocket forces

                On Thursday, Anwar, who is also the finance minister, announced that the government is deliberating to greenlight the use of EPF savings as collateral for emergency loans, following repeated calls from the Opposition to allow further withdrawals

                On Friday (March 10), Khor Hooi Chin, 41, from Pantai Remis, whose dress length was slightly above her knees, was denied entry into the building by a staff member who informed her that her attire failed to comply with the agency’s dress code

                In a video she posted, the woman could be heard asking the male staff member which part of her attire was not presentable

            <p>
                The man then continued to say that he could not let her go to the offices on the upper floors as her dress did not follow the guidelines

                The Malay-nationalist party Youth leader claimed that government lawmakers rarely mention the Malay-Bumiputera plight in the Dewan Rakyat and only PN leaders remain vocal about it

            <p>
                He then went on to say that this was a sign Malay politics is entering the “age of decline”

            <p>
                “Minimal Malay representation in legislative institutions in the Federation is causing the Malay narrative to become increasingly insignificant, and threatens to turn it into a narrow or alternative one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In fact, if legislative institutions talk about Malay interests, Malay programmes and initiatives, as well as pro-Malay policies and laws, they are considered foreign, or not inclusive enough for politics in Malaysia at this time,” he added

                The Malay-nationalist party Youth leader claimed that government lawmakers rarely mention the Malay-Bumiputera plight in the Dewan Rakyat and only PN leaders remain vocal about it

            <p>
                He then went on to say that this was a sign Malay politics is entering the “age of decline”

                “Minimal Malay representation in legislative institutions in the Federation is causing the Malay narrative to become increasingly insignificant, and threatens to turn it into a narrow or alternative one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In fact, if legislative institutions talk about Malay interests, Malay programmes and initiatives, as well as pro-Malay policies and laws, they are considered foreign, or not inclusive enough for politics in Malaysia at this time,” he added

                And with Wout Weghorst failing to score in seven league games since joining on loan in January, it’s little wonder Ten Hag is ‘in the front row’ to sign the Serbian striker this summer

                The 23-year-old has eight goals from 16 Serie A games this season but has failed to score in six of his last seven league outings, so his future in Turin could be uncertain

                Vlahovic has spent three months out with injury too, so he’s only netted twice in Serie A since October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Juventus spent €81m (£71.7m) on the 23-year-old, so they would likely want most of that money back if they were to agree a sale

                Any officer of a public body who uses his office or position for any gratification, whether for himself, his relative or associate, commits an offence — Section 23 (1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Use of position for gratification The prosecution must prove that the accused had used his position for gratification whether for himself, his relative or associate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, the gratification can be for the accused himself or his relative or his associate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One can say that Section 23(2) — and Section 23(1) as well — is an improvement of section 15(2) ACA

            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the prosecution failed to prove the basic facts, the presumption under Section 23(2) will not have any application, which consequently will not only affect the second element of ‘using office or position for any gratification’ in Section 23(1) but the whole of the offence under Section 23(1) will fall, unless of course if the prosecution adduces direct evidence establishing the fact of the accused using his office or position for gratification

                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim told the Dewan Rakyat on Thursday that he agreed with the criticism Johari had raised on Malaysia’s settlement deal with Goldman Sachs on 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last week, Johari said the government should review its deal with Goldman Sachs for its role in the scandal as the final sum was “too low”

            <p>
                “Goldman Sachs profited off our hardship and pain.” Goldman Sachs and the Malaysian government are currently in dispute over how much the US bank owes Malaysia for its role in raising US$6.5bil (RM29.4bil at present exchange rates) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The settlement announced by the previous government in July 2020 called for Goldman Sachs to pay US$2.5bil (RM11.3bil) while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4bil (RM6.33bil) of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the world, in exchange for Malaysia dropping charges against the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johari last week said the US$2.5bil figure agreed upon was too little, and Goldman Sachs should be made to pay the US$1.4bil sum outright
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “How can we allow Goldman Sachs just to run away like that when its senior management was involved?” Johari was the second finance minister during Najib ’s administration at the height of the 1MDB scandal

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 11 — The federal government is only expected to table in June the proposed amendment to enable foreign-born children of Malaysian mothers to automatically gain citizenship here, Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said has confirmed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Bill to amend the Constitution is expected to be tabled during the next sitting since there are some issues to be further deliberated, especially the issue of dual citizenship,” she said in a written response to Malay Mail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A Cabinet committee on the citizenship issue has been formed and is currently deliberating on issues pertaining to citizenship in preparation for the next sitting,” she said, when asked whether the Bill would be tabled in the year’s second meeting from June 12 to June 27 or the third that will go from October 9 to November 30
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Yes, it is needed by virtue of Article 159 of the Federal Constitution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on Azalina’s response, this would mean that the Cabinet committee will be finalising issues related to the Bill such as how the amended citizenship law would be implemented, with the government expected to present the finalised Bill to the Conference of Rulers for consent, before finally tabling the Bill in Parliament once royal consent is obtained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The proposed amendment would also result in Malaysian mothers being able to enjoy the same right — as guaranteed under Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution which disallows gender discrimination — to pass on their citizenship to their children born abroad, which Malaysian fathers currently already possess

                Inter Milan's faint hopes of catching runaway Serie A leaders Napoli suffered a huge blow when they fell to a shock 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Spezia on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spezia struck through Daniel Maldini and M'Bala Nzola's penalty to beat Inter for the first time, with Romelu Lukaku's equaliser from the spot counting for nothing in the end

                It's not right that Inter lose to Spezia," Inter manager Simone Inzaghi told DAZN

            <p>
                Inter got another penalty after 83 minutes when Denzel Dumfries was fouled and this time Lukaku made no mistake

                When we look at Liverpool’s Allison and Manchester City’s Ederson, their technical ability and pinpoint accuracy when helping their team move the ball up the pitch breeds confidence in their teammates and allows the team to become less one-dimensional

                Dalot’s comfortability when receiving the ball at his feet or on the half term and his calmness of playing out from the back alongside his passing range and crossing ability was a key factor in Ten Hag’s decision to opt with Dalot over Wan-Bissaka

                During his time at United, he has often looked shaky when on the ball and lacking in terms of passing and crossing ability but since the World Cup break, he has had to step in for the injured Dalot and has looked like a new player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Dalot was substituted for Wan-Bissaka at half-time, United started to regain their control in the match thanks to the right-back’s quick one-touch passing and calmness on the ball

                About Us Advertise LONDON, March 11 — Alex Scott, the host of the BBC’s Football Focus TV programme in Britain, said it “does not feel right” to appear on the show on Saturday after the broadcaster took presenter Gary Lineker off air over his criticism of the government’s asylum policy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other presenters have also pulled out of BBC appearances after former England soccer captain Lineker, who presents the flagship Match of the Day soccer highlights programme, was taken off air by the BBC on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The row began after Lineker, the BBC’s highest-paid presenter, described new government legislation on migrants as a “cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s.” The BBC said there had to be an agreed position on Lineker’s use of social media before he could return to the broadcaster

            <p>
                Jason Mohammad, who presents the BBC’s Final Score, also said on Saturday that he has pulled out of his programme

                Erling Haaland is having an incredible season, but Liverpool knows Luis Suárez and Mohamed Salah have set the Premier League bar to clear, with some way still to go
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, is it the greatest ever season by a Premier League striker? It could yet end up as such
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And his debut season was just as explosive as Haaland’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s when Salah set the 32-goal target which Haaland is now chasing down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, it is within Haaland’s power to increase his rate of scoring and assisting between now and the end of the season, meaning he could yet overtake both Salah and Suárez

                Erling Haaland is having an incredible season, but Liverpool knows Luis Suárez and Mohamed Salah have set the Premier League bar to clear, with some way still to go
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, is it the greatest ever season by a Premier League striker? It could yet end up as such
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And his debut season was just as explosive as Haaland’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s when Salah set the 32-goal target which Haaland is now chasing down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, it is within Haaland’s power to increase his rate of scoring and assisting between now and the end of the season, meaning he could yet overtake both Salah and Suárez
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But he will have to do more than cross the 32-goal threshold to receive any recognition from Liverpool as the striker to have delivered the greatest single season the Premier League has ever seen.

                After former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin was released on bail by the commission yesterday, he alleged that the MACC appeared to be acting on instructions from “above”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, the MACC rejected the allegation and insisted its entire investigation was the result of its independent effort

            <p>
                The investigation process was free from interference by any party
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier today, Muhyiddin was charged with four counts of corruption and two counts of money laundering, becoming the latest Bersatu leader to be prosecuted over the Bumiputera assistance scheme launched when he was the prime minister

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Muhyiddin became the second Malaysian prime minister to be charged with corruption, after Datuk Seri Najib Razak who has already been convicted in one of his cases

                Leissner is likely to get rewarded for his cooperation with prosecutors, leaving Ng as the only Goldman banker to spend significant time behind bars for the fraud

                A report on 1MDB issued by Better Markets concluded that without Goldman Sachs, the fraud scheme would have never happened

                The disgraced 51-year-old former Goldman managing director had asked the judge to mete out no jail time at all, beyond the six-month term he’d already served in a squalid Malaysian facility
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Thursday, the judge cited his Malaysian detention as one reason she didn’t grant prosecutors’ request for a 15-year term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I would imagine a 10-year sentence will make an impression on them,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>

                The abandoned campaign is a marketing setback for Japan Airlines as demand for travel within the island nation picks up, with the government planning to downgrade Covid to the same category as seasonal influenza in May

                The website was hit around midnight on Thursday, when the airline began its “JAL Smiles” campaign offering domestic one-way tickets at a flat rate of 6,600 yen (RM218 or US$48) for adults and 4,950 yen (RM163) for children, during April through June

                This follows the High Court on Friday (March 10) striking out the election petition filed by a 49-year-old voter, Datuk Ahmad Faisal Abdul Karim

                High Court judge Datuk Faizah Jamaludin allowing the preliminary objection made by Radzi in citing the petition filed by Ahmad Faisal as defective as it lacks certain particulars of the said alleged bribe that occurred in the election

                Former leader faces trial on charges of money laundering and abuse of power over COVID-19 contracts

            <p>
                Malaysia’s former Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has been charged with abuse of power and money laundering in connection with the awarding of government contracts during the COVID-19 pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He faces four counts of abuse of power involving 232.5 million ringgit ($51.40 million), and two counts of money laundering involving 195 million ringgit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dozens of people gathered at the court to show their support for Muhyiddin with some wearing bandanas emblazoned with the word ‘Abah’ (father), which was how Muhyiddin referred to himself during the pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin was granted bail of 2 million Malaysian ringgit ($442,674) by the judge and asked to surrender his passport

                The Seremban police chief said an investigation revealed that the incident happened around 2pm on Dec 30 last year along the Seremban-Port Dickson Highway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our probe shows that a 32-year-old man driving a four-wheel drive pickup stopped his vehicle along the fast lane of the highway, blocking a 52-year-old driver of a luxury car heading in the same direction towards Port Dickson
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The two got into an argument earlier when they stopped at the Mambau rest and service (R&R) area after some items fell off the pickup and almost hit the other car along the highway,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ACP Nanda said that after a brief argument, the two motorists decided to drive off, but the pickup driver then overtook the other car and blocked it near the Sua Betong traffic light junction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The case is being investigated under Rule 92A of the Road Traffic Rules 1959.

                The Seremban police chief said an investigation revealed that the incident happened around 2pm on Dec 30 last year along the Seremban-Port Dickson Highway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our probe shows that a 32-year-old man driving a four-wheel drive pickup stopped his vehicle along the fast lane of the highway, blocking a 52-year-old driver of a luxury car heading in the same direction towards Port Dickson
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The two got into an argument earlier when they stopped at the Mambau rest and service (R&R) area after some items fell off the pickup and almost hit the other car along the highway,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ACP Nanda said that after a brief argument, the two motorists decided to drive off, but the pickup driver then overtook the other car and blocked it near the Sua Betong traffic light junction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The case is being investigated under Rule 92A of the Road Traffic Rules 1959.

            <p>
                Any player who produces a vivacious showing against a huge team like Liverpool is almost instantly connected with top clubs across Europe as they try and snatch the next top talent before anybody else can, much like what happened with Núñez or Mykhailo Mudryk for Chelsea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ramos’ recent European performance, however, against Club Brugge in the round of 16 is what has caught the eye of many

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Introducing a player such as Ramos to his international teammate Diogo Jota, and more importantly Núñez, would also be a great move from Klopp

                If Liverpool did go in for Ramos as part of a huge summer spending spree, it would certainly be difficult

            <p>
                Now, with Roberto Firmino leaving in summer, Ramos could be the perfect replacement despite his price tag.

                Anwar told Parliament late on Thursday (March 9) that he agreed with criticism Johari (BN-Titiwangsa) had raised on Malaysia’s settlement deal with Goldman Sachs on 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Goldman Sachs profited off our hardship and pain.” Goldman Sachs and the Malaysian government are currently in dispute over how much the US bank owes Malaysia for its role in raising $6.5bil (RM29.4bil at present exchange rates) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The settlement announced by the previous government in July 2020 called for Goldman Sachs to pay US$2.5bil (RM11.3bil) while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4bil (RM6.33bil) of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the world, in exchange for Malaysia dropping charges against the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Why should we sacrifice money that we can get from the number one investment bank in the world?” Johari said on Feb 27, to thumps of approval from fellow lawmakers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How can we allow Goldman Sachs just to run away like that when its senior management was involved?” Johari was the second finance minister during jailed former premier Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s administration at the height of the 1MDB scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He lost his parliamentary seat in 2018 but won it back in November’s general election, and has since raised the Goldman Sachs issue in Parliament and in interviews with local media

                The other factor is that 59% of the 2.85 million members in this age group applied for Covid-19 related withdrawals and withdrew more than RM62bil in total

                Anwar was responding to reporters who brought up allegations by former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin’s supporters that the MACC’s move to arrest him was politically motivated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar stressed that the MACC was merely doing its job and that critics should not be so quick to claim that the MACC was politically motivated without looking at the evidence and the charges

                Xi Jinping also received unanimous votes for a third term as chairman of the country's Central Military Commission

                China's President Xi Jinping swears under oath after being re-elected as president for a third term during the third plenary session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Mar 10, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nearly 3,000 members of China's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), voted unanimously in the Great Hall of the People for Xi to be president in an election where there was no other candidate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The vote on Friday was largely ceremonial as Xi had already locked in a historic third term as head of the Chinese Communist Party at a major party congress last October, sealing his place as China's most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A subsequent wave infected most of China's 1.4 billion people, but China has not released a full tally of related deaths
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China's economy grew just 3 per cent last year, among its worst performances in decades, and during parliament, Beijing set a modest growth target for this year of just around 5 per cent.

                Xi Jinping also received unanimous votes for a third term as chairman of the country's Central Military Commission

                China's President Xi Jinping swears under oath after being re-elected as president for a third term during the third plenary session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Mar 10, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nearly 3,000 members of China's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), voted unanimously in the Great Hall of the People for Xi to be president in an election where there was no other candidate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The vote on Friday was largely ceremonial as Xi had already locked in a historic third term as head of the Chinese Communist Party at a major party congress last October, sealing his place as China's most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A subsequent wave infected most of China's 1.4 billion people, but China has not released a full tally of related deaths
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China's economy grew just 3 per cent last year, among its worst performances in decades, and during parliament, Beijing set a modest growth target for this year of just around 5 per cent.

                About Us Advertise   PUTRAJAYA, March 10 — Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor has withdrawn her appeal to recuse High Court Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal Judge, from hearing her money laundering and tax evasion case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the notice of discontinuance filed by Messrs Geethan Ram on March 1, Rosmah as the appellant withdrew the appeal which was filed through a notice of appeal dated April 29, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following that, the appeal is deemed to have been dismissed as stipulated in Rule 73, Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hearing of the appeal of the wife of former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak was scheduled for March 17 at the Court of Appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In November last year, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal postponed the hearing of Rosmah’s appeal because the court wanted the defence and prosecution to file further submissions on whether it had the jurisdiction to hear the appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the High Court granted the application for a stay of execution of the prison sentence and fine pending her appeal at the Court of Appeal

                The company delivered record sales of $220.7 million – amounting to a 36.3% year-over-year increase – yet falling short of consensus expectations by $48 million

                Meanwhile, the other player being linked with a Liverpool move has been labeled as the 'next' Neymar (whether the player wants to be coined as such remains to be seen), with Jürgen Klopp supposedly sending scouts to Brazil to see him in action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here is the Liverpool.com verdict on the transfer gossip to emerge around the Reds today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A player who is no stranger to being linked with Liverpool, Asensio has been on the club's radar for quite some time now, if reports are to be believed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Footballtransfers.com, Liverpool is interested in bringing the Spanish winger to Anfield as a free agent in the summer
            </p>

                The defeat marked the second match in row in which the 38-year-old Ronaldo failed to find the net, with Al-Ittihad goalkeeper Marcelo Grohe parrying away a fierce shot from the Portugal superstar in injury time

                Brazilian Romarinho scored 10 minutes from time to seal victory for Al-Ittihad, who leapfrogged Al-Nassr to take top spot in the league table

                In 2023, the Blue Oval is introducing a new version called the Puma ST Powershift, which does things a little differently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the bonnet, the 1.5 litre powerplant is replaced with a 1.0 litre three-cylinder EcoBoost engine that is accompanied by a 48-volt mild hybrid system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Such a setup isn’t new for the Puma, but on the ST Powershift variant, you get 170 PS (168 hp or 125 kW) and 248 Nm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The non-ST version of the Puma with a mild hybrid powertrain manages as much as 155 PS (153 hp or 114 kW) and 240 Nm – the gains are down to tweaks to the powertrain software and higher recharging capability of the mild hybrid system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Puma ST Powershift’s figures are still far from the manual variant, but the main appeal is the standard seven-speed dual-clutch transmission
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The styling is identical too, although there’s a new Azura Blue colour for 2023

                On March 9, Moscow conducted a massive missile attack on Ukraine, employing 81 missiles of various types, including Kinzal hypersonic missiles

                Serhiy Popko, the head of the city’s military administration, posted on Telegram that cruise missiles and Shahed drones were used in the strikes on Kyiv.  He wrote that while the drones and cruise missiles were shot down, a hypersonic missile that was thought to be a Kinzhal struck the city

                On March 9, Moscow conducted a massive missile attack on Ukraine, employing 81 missiles of various types, including Kinzal hypersonic missiles

                According to a statement published on Facebook by the Ukrainian Military, 81 missiles and eight drones were used to attack Ukraine during the overnight raids

                The Ukrainian military claimed that six of the missiles were Kinzhal hypersonic missiles

            <p>
                According to the air force command, the major missile attack against Ukraine’s vital infrastructure was fired from ten Tu-95 strategic aircraft, seven Tu-22M3 long-range aircraft, eight Su-35 fighter aircraft, six MiG-31K aircraft, and three Kalibr missile carriers in the Black Sea

                Serhiy Popko, the head of the city’s military administration, posted on Telegram that cruise missiles and Shahed drones were used in the strikes on Kyiv.  He wrote that while the drones and cruise missiles were shot down, a hypersonic missile that was thought to be a Kinzhal struck the city

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 — Datuk Mohd Radzi Md Jidin of Bersatu has retained his position as Putrajaya Member of Parliament, after an election court rejected a petition that was filed against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was after High Court Judge Datuk Faizah Jamaludin allowed a preliminary objection made by Mohd Radzi to strike out the petition filed by Putrajaya Umno division vice chief Datuk Ahmad Faisal Abdul Karim

            <p>
                In the petition filed on January 26, Ahmad Faisal was seeking a court order to declare that Mohd Radzi should not have been declared the winner of the Putrajaya seat in the 15th general election on November 19 last year as his alleged bribes of RM150 each induced voters to vote for him and not other candidates

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 — Attorney General Tan Sri Idrus Harun today rejected allegations that his agency engaged in selective prosecution and persecution, such as Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia leaders alleged over the charges against Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement was issued shortly after the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission sent out its own to insist on its complete independence in the investigation of the JanaWibawa scheme, for which it has charged three Bersatu leaders including Muhyiddin today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The AG said his office rejected the allegations of bias and persecution against any individual, before insisting that the decisions to prosecute were made without fear or favour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier today, Muhyiddin was charged with four counts of corruption and two counts of money laundering, becoming the latest Bersatu leader to be prosecuted over the Bumiputera assistance scheme launched when he was the prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, he reiterated his claims of political motive, purporting that the charges against him were meant to put his party on par with Umno, which is part of the current government and whose president Zahid remains on trial for corruption
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bersatu had pre-emptively claimed persecution even before its leaders began to be charged over the JanaWibawa scheme, and began doing so after the party’s bank accounts were frozen as part of the MACC investigation earlier this year.

                Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) president Abdul Hadi Awang giving a speech at a religious gathering in Terengganu, Malaysia on Mar 4, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The unity government comprises PH, Barisan Nasional, Gabungan Parti Sarawak and Gabungan Rakyat Sabah, among others.  "It is very unbecoming of an MP to make a statement saying there are efforts by the opposition to topple the government," said Amanah exco member Fadhli Umar Aminolhuda after lodging the police report, according to The Star
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Such a statement will only lead to trouble and disrupt public order.” On Tuesday, Amanah president Mohamad Sabu expressed concern that Mr Abdul Hadi’s remarks would drive away investors from the country.  “When a big leader like (Abdul) Hadi Awang mentions (the desire to) change the government, (and) not through elections, it can scare and unsettle investors,” he said in a video posted on Facebook.  “It is known … that the change of three prime ministers in a short time has affected the flow of investments to Malaysia.” On Monday, local media reported Mr Abdul Hadi as saying that based on Malaysia’s democratic system, no one had the right to stop PN’s efforts to topple the government of the day.  He said that such an attempt can be done either through a vote of no-confidence or via statutory declarations, according to Bernama.  "This is normal in a democratic country (such as Malaysia),” he was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times (NST).  He added that the king’s decree is not “the final word” to prevent change from happening in a democratic country.  “We still uphold democracy based on our constitutional monarchy,” he reportedly said.  He had previously cautioned the government against blaming the opposition if the government collapses again, saying that the blame should be placed on the government’s own flaws and weaknesses instead.  Last year, Mr Abdul Hadi reportedly said that he had initiated the “Sheraton Move” which saw the fall of the short-lived PH administration back in 2020, leading to several years of political instability in the country.  Meanwhile, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) youth chief Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal on Friday defended Mr Abdul Hadi, claiming that the latter’s remarks were “misconstrued” by the media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Wan Fayhsal said that the Marang MP was explaining that in a parliamentary democracy, a change in government could always happen despite an anti-hopping law in place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The options are always there for a shift of alignment of parties or MPs to support anyone among us to become the prime minister,” he said, according to Free Malaysia Today (FMT).  He also claimed that the PH coalition appeared to be afraid.  “My answer is simple, if you truly have two-thirds support (in parliament), why are you afraid? Why are you so afraid to the point of urging the home minister to use a security measure to probe an ‘academic’ comment from a politician about a change in government?” he was quoted as saying by FMT.

                In his winding-up speech for the policy stage of Budget 2023, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said this, however, will only apply to those who are really struggling with their financial circumstances

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also stressed that it was unfair to make Malaysians keep dipping into their retirement savings when these have already been drawn down repeatedly during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying the government would instead look for alternatives to help
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar’s Budget 2023 sailed through the policy stage via a voice vote at the Dewan Rakyat today

                In his winding-up speech for the policy stage of Budget 2023, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said this, however, will only apply to those who are really struggling with their financial circumstances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I welcome the opinions, but we must remember that EPF is meant as retirement savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the best,” Anwar, who is also finance minister, said in Parliament today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also stressed that it was unfair to make Malaysians keep dipping into their retirement savings when these have already been drawn down repeatedly during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying the government would instead look for alternatives to help
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar’s Budget 2023 sailed through the policy stage via a voice vote at the Dewan Rakyat today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Parliament Speaker Datuk Seri Johari Abdul called the vote on the Supply Bill 2023 after a winding-up speech from Anwar, who is also the finance minister.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                They named MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki, MACC investigation division senior director Datuk Seri Hishamuddin Hashim, MACC anti-money laundering division director Datuk Mohamad Zamri Zainul Abidin, Immigration director-general Datuk Seri Khairul Dzaimee Daud, 13 MACC officers, along with the MACC, the Immigration Department, and the Government as respondents

            <p>
                According to the application, the party wants the court to revoke the freeze order issued by the MACC since it claimed they were not given any prior notification from the agency before the order was executed around January this year

                EPF said that lower starting salaries for those who began careers early before minimum wage was implemented in 2013 is among the factors to low overall member savings for this age group
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also pointed out structural wage challenge as another reason where 44 per cent of EPF’s contributors earn less than RM2,000 and 81 per cent earns less than RM5,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                EPF also said that a total of 2.85 million members or 59 per cent of members in this age group applied for Covid-19 related withdrawals and withdrew more than RM62 billion in total, which further reduced their savings

                According to Ahmad, GST can curb the black economy, which consists of about 30% of the gross domestic product (GDP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The GST could reduce the black economy by about 20%,” said Ahmad

                “We hope that with the use of e-invoicing, we can increase our revenue and reduce the black economy before a decision is made on GST,” added Ahmad

                “More than 90% of countries in the world implemented GST or VAT and surely, they can’t be wrong,” said Ahmad

            <p>
                “After deducting GST refunds of around RM67.8bil, GST’s net revenue was RM133.1bil in over three years,” added Ahmad

                Nevertheless, Ahmad said the government has no plans to implement the GST at the moment.

                But Ng has asked Brodie to sentence him to no jail time in the US, arguing that the six months he spent in a Malaysian prison before extradition to New York and four years of house arrest were punishment enough.  Agnifilo on Wednesday also argued that Ng deserves leniency because the Malaysian government “has been made whole” because he relinquished claims to US$35.1 million that it seized from his accounts

                Ng and his former Goldman boss, Tim Leissner, were accused of conspiring with Malaysian financier Jho Low, the scheme’s alleged mastermind

                Prosecutors say Leissner made US$73.4 million in the scheme.  Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak received US$756 million and Khadem al-Qubaisi, a former managing director of Abu Dhabi’s state-owned International Petroleum Investment Co, which guaranteed the 1MDB transactions, got US$472.8 million, a forensic accountant with the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified at Ng’s trial.  Goldman paid more than US$2.9 billion to US authorities and more than US$5 billion globally for its role in the scheme, with its Malaysian unit pleading guilty in the US to a single conspiracy charge

                It’s mine to play the best I can at the club and the national team and then the transfer will come on its own
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Every summer there have been sales of players, and I assume that the upcoming summer transfer window will be the same or similar

            <p>
                Potentially missing for a little while, that could perhaps put Liverpool off from signing him in the summer

            <p>
                But should they decide to invest in Sucic, he’d be very much one for the future

            <p>
                Unlikely to cost a huge amount, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see Liverpool bet on him as a third midfield signing this summer

                The plan to split "Big Four" firm Ernst & Young (EY) has been “paused”

            <p>
                According to a March 9 article in Financial Times, the plan was halted after disagreements were made as to how much of the firm’s tax business should remain with its audit side

            <p>
                It is understood that all PAS and Bersatu MPs were told to show support to Muhyiddin on Thursday (March 9)

                After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the bank isn’t finished raising rates, one market expert has warned a crash could come in a matter of days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The withdrawal of capital from middle-class families has been "spectacular," McDonald argued, as the Fed continues its most aggressive rate hike campaign since the 1980s to crush decades-high inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Ten million in cash today generates $510,000 a year in Treasuries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have to do the math here, common sense," McDonald explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You're flat to down after two years, and now you're looking over at a money market fund or a one-year treasury, and you get $510,000 of interest risk-free when a year ago you were getting 70." The market crash trigger, he further predicted, will come from the S&P earnings missing estimates big time

                After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the bank isn’t finished raising rates, one market expert has warned a crash could come in a matter of days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The withdrawal of capital from middle-class families has been "spectacular," McDonald argued, as the Fed continues its most aggressive rate hike campaign since the 1980s to crush decades-high inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Ten million in cash today generates $510,000 a year in Treasuries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have to do the math here, common sense," McDonald explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You're flat to down after two years, and now you're looking over at a money market fund or a one-year treasury, and you get $510,000 of interest risk-free when a year ago you were getting 70." The market crash trigger, he further predicted, will come from the S&P earnings missing estimates big time

                Spurs were knocked out of Europe's premier cup competition by AC Milan after failing to score in both legs as the Serie A club progressed 1-0 on aggregate

                Richarlison, who was signed by Spurs in the close season in a deal worth 60 million pounds ($71.21 million), has found game time hard to come by under Conte and played only the last 20 minutes against Milan in the 0-0 draw at home

                "There was no explanation again, let's see what he (Conte) will tell us on Thursday but I'm not silly, I'm a professional that works hard every day and I want to play." Richarlison netted three times for Brazil at the World Cup but has scored only two goals for Tottenham this season and the 25-year-old has yet to open his account for the club in the Premier League, where they are fourth

                The head of Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) Suharyanto, who goes by one name, said the Natuna district government had agreed to relocate dozens of families away from the affected area to mitigate the risks from future disasters

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tesla's overhyped investor day underwhelmed the masses as it didn't unveil a speculated cheaper new model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then, the company cut prices again to stoke demand — this time on the high-end Model X and Model S

            <p>
                Yanoshik thinks investors need to adjust their timeline on when a cheaper Tesla will arrive and start contributing to profits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It could expand Tesla’s total addressable market (TAM) by [$1 trillion excluding credits], which is 75% larger based on our forecast of market size in 2026
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We model a slow rollout in the segment, however, not breaking through a 1 million vehicle delivery run-rate (roughly our 2023E Model Y volume) until 2028," Yanoshik notes

                The downgrade comes on the heels of a mixed week or so of news for Tesla, as Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tesla's overhyped investor day underwhelmed the masses as it didn't unveil a speculated cheaper new model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then, the company cut prices again to stoke demand — this time on the high-end Model X and Model S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yanoshik thinks investors need to adjust their timeline on when a cheaper Tesla will arrive and start contributing to profits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It could expand Tesla’s total addressable market (TAM) by [$1 trillion excluding credits], which is 75% larger based on our forecast of market size in 2026
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We model a slow rollout in the segment, however, not breaking through a 1 million vehicle delivery run-rate (roughly our 2023E Model Y volume) until 2028," Yanoshik notes

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 – Several civil society groups, creative organisations and individuals have urged the government to not engage in a “witch hunt” over the Mentega Terbang movie

            <p>
                The signatories included Amnesty International Malaysia, singer-songwriter and academic Azmyl Yunor, the Association of Women Lawyers, writer and musician Brian Gomez, Beyond Borders, the Centre for Independent Journalism, arts practitioner Chi Too, writer and academic Faisal Tehrani, Five Arts Centre, Freedom Film Network, and GERAK (Malaysian Academic Workforce Movement)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement was in response to the federal police confirming on Monday an investigation into the locally produced Mentega Terbang movie over recent allegations of religious provocation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In today’s statement, the coalition also questioned the apparent lack of response by the authorities over the threats of physical violence and sexual harassment against the filmmakers and producers of Mentega Terbang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Released in 2021, the movie explores the similarities and expressions of the major religions in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following its release on the Viu streaming service last January, the movie was criticised by some members of the public including local singer Caprice as well as by Parti Bumiputera Perkasa Malaysia (Putra), which lodged a police report against it last week.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 — Home Minister Senator Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has defended his decision to exempt Umno from deregistration over its motion to prohibit contests for its top two posts during internal elections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dissatisfied with Saifuddin’s answer, Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan (Perikatan Nasional - Kota Baru) then asked the minister to verify a supposed letter from the Registrar of Societies (RoS) to Umno directing the party to take “corrective measure” over the motion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Opposition chief whip said the minister’s decision to exempt Umno could have broad ramifications for all parties in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Saifuddin said he had, using his power as the home minister under Section 70 of the Societies Act, decided to exempt Umno from complying with that Act’s Section 13(1)(c)(iv) in relation to the approved motion in the 2022 Umno general assembly to not have the top two posts contested, after the reference was made to Umno’s party constitution and its rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Section 70 states the home minister’s power to use his discretion to exempt any society registered under the Societies Act from all or any of the provisions of the Act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid said Umno’s secretary-general had received a letter from the Home Ministry to approve the no-contest motion for the top two posts and said it was sufficient to prove that the motion was legitimate, also insisting that the Home Minister has the final say.

                Liverpool supporters will have been lapping up stats and facts continually since their side dismantled Manchester United on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Way down the list of numerical minutiae was something related to Darwin Nunez’ first goal, the Reds’ second of the afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With his brace against United, Nunez has three headed goals in the Premier League, putting him joint-fourth in the standings for this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Nunez was one of only three players to score home and away against the Reds last season – more trivia for you – his goals were fierce finishes from his right foot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In league and Europe, he scored a headed goal every 434 minutes last season, yet his rate for the Reds (in all competitions) has improved to one every 380
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What makes this more interesting is that Nunez appears very efficient in this regard, when his general finishing has been questioned throughout his time with Liverpool

                Liverpool supporters will have been lapping up stats and facts continually since their side dismantled Manchester United on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Way down the list of numerical minutiae was something related to Darwin Nunez’ first goal, the Reds’ second of the afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With his brace against United, Nunez has three headed goals in the Premier League, putting him joint-fourth in the standings for this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Nunez was one of only three players to score home and away against the Reds last season – more trivia for you – his goals were fierce finishes from his right foot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In league and Europe, he scored a headed goal every 434 minutes last season, yet his rate for the Reds (in all competitions) has improved to one every 380
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What makes this more interesting is that Nunez appears very efficient in this regard, when his general finishing has been questioned throughout his time with Liverpool

                Malaysia said on Wednesday it will summon to court the descendants of a former sultan in a dispute involving three of the government's properties in Paris, following the heirs' efforts to enforce a US$15 billion (RM67 billion) arbitration award

            <p>
                The Filipino heirs of the last Sultan of Sulu won the award in a French arbitration court last year in a dispute over a colonial-era land agreement, which independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the descendants a token sum annually

            <p>
                Malaysia, which did not participate in the arbitration, maintains the process was illegal and has obtained a stay on the ruling in France

            <p>
                The dispute stems from an 1878 agreement that was signed between two European colonists and the Sultan of Sulu for use of his territory in present-day Malaysia

                Mr Sivakumar Packirisamy, president of the non-governmental organisation Green Earth Society in Johor, expressed concern that floodwaters have not receded in parts of the state, despite the weather being mostly sunny over the last couple of days.  He highlighted that in places like Batu Pahat for instance, the water level has actually increased, leading to more people being forced out of their homes.   “Flood mitigation measures along the rivers in Johor have to be improved

                On Monday, Johor chief minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi warned that in spite of good weather, residents of Batu Pahat needed to be wary as river water from Segamat was flowing south and causing water levels to rise in some areas.  Batu Pahat is the worst-hit district in Johor, with more than 27,000 people displaced.  Mr Ling Tian Soon, state assemblyman for Yong Peng, told CNA on Monday that a key reason why many areas of Batu Pahat were flooded was because of overflow from the Bekok River
