                Chinese President Xi Jinping can position himself as a peacemaker after state visit to Russia

            <p>
                On Tuesday (Mar 21), Xi and Putin signed a joint declaration deepening the China-Russia partnership, more than a year after they proclaimed “no limits” to that relationship in Beijing before Putin launched his “special military operation” in Ukraine

                Xi has not openly supported Putin’s war, with China taking a more neutral position than what Putin might have expected from a “no limits” friend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The point is to position China as a peacemaker and the United States as a warmonger supplying Ukraine with weapons

            <p>
                Economic ties between China and Russia will also be strengthened, with a joint statement on a plan to develop economic cooperation until 2030

                Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has been dealt yet another blow after running into various difficulties trying to bolster his attacking options at Old Trafford Erik ten Hag's hopes of landing a star striker for Manchester United have been dealt a blow with Napoli after a £150m fee for target Victor Osimhen, it has been claimed

                Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has been dealt yet another blow after running into various difficulties trying to bolster his attacking options at Old Trafford Erik ten Hag's hopes of landing a star striker for Manchester United have been dealt a blow with Napoli after a £150m fee for target Victor Osimhen, it has been claimed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Man Utd spent to bring Cristiano Ronaldo back to Old Trafford in 2021, and the Portugal international was one of the options available to Ten Hag ahead of his first campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It would be difficult for United to land Osimhen, if reports from Il Mattino (via The Mail) are to be believed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea are also said to be interested in the 24-year-old, who cost €70m (£61.7m) from Lille in 2020

                A headhunter in London – where Credit Suisse employs about 5,500 people, according to its website – said he’s been fielding calls all weekend, particularly from those in the equities division where the overlap with existing business at UBS is extensive

                So if you're in the process of filing for divorce, the fate of your pension is likely at the forefront of your mind
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How a Pension Is Handled During a Divorce A pension earned by one spouse is usually considered a joint asset, as are other retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s, 403(b)s and IRAs, though state laws govern the latter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Legalese Behind a Pension in a Divorce If you have a pension, you've likely heard of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Power of Bargaining During a Divorce If you have a pension and are in the midst of a divorce, don't just fork over half blindly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line When facing a divorce, your spouse will generally be entitled to some of your pension
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you have a pension and are getting a divorce, you can still do things to protect your financial interests

                So if you're in the process of filing for divorce, the fate of your pension is likely at the forefront of your mind
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How a Pension Is Handled During a Divorce A pension earned by one spouse is usually considered a joint asset, as are other retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s, 403(b)s and IRAs, though state laws govern the latter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Legalese Behind a Pension in a Divorce If you have a pension, you've likely heard of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Power of Bargaining During a Divorce If you have a pension and are in the midst of a divorce, don't just fork over half blindly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line When facing a divorce, your spouse will generally be entitled to some of your pension
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you have a pension and are getting a divorce, you can still do things to protect your financial interests
            </p>

                Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag sees the Premier League winger as the key to getting more from Marcus Rashford Manchester United are plotting a summer swoop for Brighton & Hove Albion winger Kaoru Mitoma
            </p>

                Mitoma has been dazzling for Brighton this season, scoring nine times and assisting six in 29 appearances for the Seagulls.  The 25 year old is a new addition at the Amex this term, having arrived in England from Japanese club Kawisake Frontale in the summer of 2021

            </p>

                It is believed Ten Hag is keen to add more workrate and quality to his frontline next term, and sees Mitoma - a popular player on Fantasy Football apps - as the ideal addition to his squad.  It is also felt that Mitoma could hold the key to Manchester United's problems at centre-forward

                Syamsul Yusof revealed this while filing a nusyuz (disobedience) application against his first wife at Syariah Court
            </p>

                He claimed that his first wife Puteri Sarah Liyana had been unfaithful in their marriage and was in contact with her college sweetheart

            <p>
                Syamsul said that he’s revealing this as the reason for filing a nusyuz (disobedience) application at the Gombak Lower Syariah Court on Tuesday (March 21) against Puteri Sarah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His filing comes two weeks after the proceeding regarding Puteri Sarah's divorce application on March 7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On that day, Syamsul objected to Puteri Sarah's divorce application and stated through his lawyer that he felt there was still hope for the two of them to reconcile
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the March 7 hearing too, the Syariah Lower Court was informed that actress Puteri Sarah was hit by her husband, Syamsul, in an incident three years ago

                Syamsul Yusof revealed this while filing a nusyuz (disobedience) application against his first wife at Syariah Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that his first wife Puteri Sarah Liyana had been unfaithful in their marriage and was in contact with her college sweetheart
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syamsul said that he’s revealing this as the reason for filing a nusyuz (disobedience) application at the Gombak Lower Syariah Court on Tuesday (March 21) against Puteri Sarah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His filing comes two weeks after the proceeding regarding Puteri Sarah's divorce application on March 7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On that day, Syamsul objected to Puteri Sarah's divorce application and stated through his lawyer that he felt there was still hope for the two of them to reconcile
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the March 7 hearing too, the Syariah Lower Court was informed that actress Puteri Sarah was hit by her husband, Syamsul, in an incident three years ago

                MANCHESTER UNITED have been handed a Europa League boost after Sevilla sacked their manager
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, United know it will not be easy against a struggling Sevilla side - with the English giants yet to register a win against them in three attempts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Record six-time winners Sevilla beat Fenerbahce to progress to the last eight, with the first leg at Old Trafford on April 13 before the return match a week later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He will, therefore, be the one tasked with keeping Sevilla in the Spanish top flight as well as trying to continue the European journey for the Europa League specialists

                MANCHESTER UNITED have been handed a Europa League boost after Sevilla sacked their manager
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, United know it will not be easy against a struggling Sevilla side - with the English giants yet to register a win against them in three attempts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Record six-time winners Sevilla beat Fenerbahce to progress to the last eight, with the first leg at Old Trafford on April 13 before the return match a week later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He will, therefore, be the one tasked with keeping Sevilla in the Spanish top flight as well as trying to continue the European journey for the Europa League specialists

            <p>
                The new dashboard design is sleek and wide with a continuous form from door to door

            <p>
                Air quality is also improved with the inclusion of a clean air filter in the ventilation system

            <p>
                As before, the Vios comes with the convenience of a Smart Entry & Pushstart System, making it unnecessary to use a key or even press the key fob

            <p>
                Despite the sleek fastback design, the luggage space in the new Vios is enlarged compared to the previous generation

                Air quality is also improved with the inclusion of a clean air filter in the ventilation system

                In a statement on Tuesday (March 21), MyCC said that this would create a competitive market that would ultimately benefit the public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Below is their statement in full
            </p>
            
            <p>
                MyCC applauds the recent commitment by YAB Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to urgently look into the monopoly of Touch 'n Go in the payment system for tolls and public transportation including reconsidering possible alternatives to stimulate the competition in the said market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                MyCC also notes the initiatives taken by the Works Ministry and Transport Ministry that are in motion such as the introduction of the Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF) which will allow users to pay tolls using other payment methods and the plan to develop more payment options for public transportation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In order to ensure concrete development in this area, MyCC through the task force set up by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living will continue to monitor the progress and behaviour of the incumbent in order to guarantee seamless entry of new players into these markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, the aspiration of the Government to inject competition into that market could not be fulfilled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, we will adopt the same approach in monitoring the development to instil competition in the payment of highway toll market and public transportation, so that we can have viable alternatives and strong competitor(s) that can compete effectively in the market for the benefit of the users”, emphasised MyCC CEO Iskandar Ismail.

                Similarly, we will adopt the same approach in monitoring the development to instil competition in the payment of highway toll market and public transportation, so that we can have viable alternatives and strong competitor(s) that can compete effectively in the market for the benefit of the users”, emphasised MyCC CEO Iskandar Ismail.

                Ahmad added that SVB ran into trouble due to a 425 base points rise in overnight policy rates (OPR) in the United States to 6.5% recently, compared to only 100 base points in the OPR here

                Anwar, who is also the finance minister, said the government had checked with the EPF and the attorney general for legal advice on this matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this method of applying for bank loans would not jeopardise the interests of EPF members, because they would continue receiving dividends on the savings used as collateral
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was replying to a supplementary question from Datuk Muslimin Yahaya (Perikatan Nasional-Sungai Besar) on whether the proposal would breach the EPF Act, and whether the PM had sought advice from the attorney general on the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said the risk to the EPF is also minimal, as there would be returns of collateral in several years, even if a small number of members fail to pay their loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the EPF wants its members to use the Islamic loan facility, but would not stop members, whether Muslims or non-Muslims, from borrowing on conventional rates

                Anwar, who is also the finance minister, said the government had checked with the EPF and the attorney general for legal advice on this matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this method of applying for bank loans would not jeopardise the interests of EPF members, because they would continue receiving dividends on the savings used as collateral
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was replying to a supplementary question from Datuk Muslimin Yahaya (Perikatan Nasional-Sungai Besar) on whether the proposal would breach the EPF Act, and whether the PM had sought advice from the attorney general on the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said the risk to the EPF is also minimal, as there would be returns of collateral in several years, even if a small number of members fail to pay their loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the EPF wants its members to use the Islamic loan facility, but would not stop members, whether Muslims or non-Muslims, from borrowing on conventional rates

                Liverpool could reportedly make a move for Lazio's Sergej Milinkovic-Savic this summer They've been linked with Jude Bellingham, but there are concerns they will miss out on him Jurgen Klopp could turn to Milinkovic-Savic instead to strengthen his midfield department It's understood that he is reluctant to leave the Serie A outfit on a free transfer in 2024, opening up the possibility that he could move on this year for a reduced fee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lazio have previously slapped a hefty price-tag on the Serbian star in an attempt to ward off interest, but it's believed a fee in the region of €50m (£44m) could be enough to tempt them to sell this summer

                Not too long after unveiling the design of the production Kia EV9, the South Korean carmaker is introducing another fully electric SUV that’s called the EV5
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahead of the release, Kia unveiled its Concept EV5 at a Kia Chinese EV Day event, and the production model will be released later this year with China as the first market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In terms of design, the Concept EV5 looks like a compact version of the Kia EV9 and it shares a similar boxy SUV styling paired with a funky wheel design
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Kia, the new all-electric SUV is said to be inspired by Kia’s ‘Opposites United’ design philosophy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Concept EV5 is said to herald a new design era for Kia and it provides a glimpse into the aesthetic direction of the brand’s future EVs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kia’s Executive Vice President and Head of Global Design Centre Karim Habib said, “The Kia Concept EV5 takes influence from the contrast and complementarity of natural landscapes and man-made architecture

            <p>
                Not too long after unveiling the design of the production Kia EV9, the South Korean carmaker is introducing another fully electric SUV that’s called the EV5
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahead of the release, Kia unveiled its Concept EV5 at a Kia Chinese EV Day event, and the production model will be released later this year with China as the first market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In terms of design, the Concept EV5 looks like a compact version of the Kia EV9 and it shares a similar boxy SUV styling paired with a funky wheel design
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Kia, the new all-electric SUV is said to be inspired by Kia’s ‘Opposites United’ design philosophy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Concept EV5 is said to herald a new design era for Kia and it provides a glimpse into the aesthetic direction of the brand’s future EVs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kia’s Executive Vice President and Head of Global Design Centre Karim Habib said, “The Kia Concept EV5 takes influence from the contrast and complementarity of natural landscapes and man-made architecture

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 — Facing a police investigation over the now cancelled “Jom Ziarah Gereja” programme, Youth and Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh has called for a stop to allegations that threaten national harmony
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking to the press before entering the Sentul police headquarters to give her statement today, Yeoh said that she would be giving her full cooperation to the police to bring the investigation to an end as soon as possible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yeoh was referring to the latest claim from Bersatu’s Badrul Hisham Shaharin — better known as Chegubard — that there is a conspiracy to cover up wrongdoings by Yeoh
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To note, last Monday, Yeoh made a police report against Chegubard on the allegations he made regarding the programme, while Chegubard made a report against the minister three days later

                A warrant of arrest had been issued against Norjuma by the Kuala Lumpur Court and the Shah Alam Court last year

            <p>
                Based on the creditors' petition, Fame Up Entertainment applied for a bankruptcy order against Norjuma as a debtor for failing to pay RM260,400 after being ordered by the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Oct 12, 2021, to do so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Muhammad Hassanuddin Roslan, representing Fame Up Entertainment, when met outside the court, said the court adjudged Norjuma bankrupt after she failed to make the settlement for the creditor's petition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said a warrant of arrest had been issued against Norjuma by the Kuala Lumpur Court and the Shah Alam Court last year

            <p>
                For the record, Fame Up Entertainment filed two defamation suits against Norjuma in 2019 and 2020

                A warrant of arrest had been issued against Norjuma by the Kuala Lumpur Court and the Shah Alam Court last year

            <p>
                Based on the creditors' petition, Fame Up Entertainment applied for a bankruptcy order against Norjuma as a debtor for failing to pay RM260,400 after being ordered by the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Oct 12, 2021, to do so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Muhammad Hassanuddin Roslan, representing Fame Up Entertainment, when met outside the court, said the court adjudged Norjuma bankrupt after she failed to make the settlement for the creditor's petition
            </p>

                He said a warrant of arrest had been issued against Norjuma by the Kuala Lumpur Court and the Shah Alam Court last year

            <p>
                For the record, Fame Up Entertainment filed two defamation suits against Norjuma in 2019 and 2020

                The demand for an apology from the Perikatan Nasional chairman comes after Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim confirmed that Lim did not revoke the foundation's tax exempt status, which was contrary to Muhyiddin's claims

            <p>
                Rather, Anwar said a tax exemption was given to Yayasan Al-Bukhary and the Al-Bukhary Group on Feb 25, 2021

            <p>

            <p>
                On March 11, Muhyiddin said that it was Lim who decided to reapply taxation and place a 45% penalty tax on Yayasan Al-Bukhary in 2018.

                Then bondholders discovered that US$17 billion worth of so-called Additional Tier 1 debt was worthless.  Aside from the sense of shame brought on by the bank’s collapse, legal observers say these three surprises raise some fundamental questions about the primacy of Swiss banking law and also sows doubt with foreign investors about putting money in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Foreign investors may wonder if Switzerland is a banana republic where the rule of law doesn’t apply,” said Peter V Kunz, a professor specialised in economic law at the University of Bern
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kern Alexander, a professor of law and finance at the University of Zurich, agreed, saying crisis management was carried out in a “panicked” way that “undermined the rule of law and undermined Switzerland”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In announcing the government-brokered sale of Credit Suisse to its Zurich rival on Sunday evening, the Swiss government cited an article of its constitution that allows it to issue temporary ordinances “to counter existing or imminent threats of serious disruption to public order or internal or external security”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Together Credit Suisse and UBS would hold 333 billion Swiss francs (US$360 billion) in customer deposits, 115 billion francs more than their nearest rival Raiffeisen, according to a UBS investor presentation.  But the biggest pushback from investors over the deal so far concerns the decision by Swiss banking regulator Finma to write down to nothing the AT1 bonds issued by Credit Suisse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Crucially, debt of this type at most other banks in Europe and the UK have far more protections and only AT1 bonds issued by Credit Suisse and former Swiss rival UBS have language in their terms that allows for total wipeout rather than a conversion to equity.  Even if the risks of those AT1 bonds were made clear to investors at the time they signed on to them, this stark example of Swiss exceptionalism marks a departure from the general rule that bondholders come before shareholders

                Then bondholders discovered that US$17 billion worth of so-called Additional Tier 1 debt was worthless.  Aside from the sense of shame brought on by the bank’s collapse, legal observers say these three surprises raise some fundamental questions about the primacy of Swiss banking law and also sows doubt with foreign investors about putting money in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Foreign investors may wonder if Switzerland is a banana republic where the rule of law doesn’t apply,” said Peter V Kunz, a professor specialised in economic law at the University of Bern
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kern Alexander, a professor of law and finance at the University of Zurich, agreed, saying crisis management was carried out in a “panicked” way that “undermined the rule of law and undermined Switzerland”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In announcing the government-brokered sale of Credit Suisse to its Zurich rival on Sunday evening, the Swiss government cited an article of its constitution that allows it to issue temporary ordinances “to counter existing or imminent threats of serious disruption to public order or internal or external security”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Together Credit Suisse and UBS would hold 333 billion Swiss francs (US$360 billion) in customer deposits, 115 billion francs more than their nearest rival Raiffeisen, according to a UBS investor presentation.  But the biggest pushback from investors over the deal so far concerns the decision by Swiss banking regulator Finma to write down to nothing the AT1 bonds issued by Credit Suisse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Crucially, debt of this type at most other banks in Europe and the UK have far more protections and only AT1 bonds issued by Credit Suisse and former Swiss rival UBS have language in their terms that allows for total wipeout rather than a conversion to equity.  Even if the risks of those AT1 bonds were made clear to investors at the time they signed on to them, this stark example of Swiss exceptionalism marks a departure from the general rule that bondholders come before shareholders

                According to the Order Paper on Parliament's official website, the matter will be raised by Datuk Muslimin Yahaya (PN-Sungai Besar) in a question to the Prime Minister during the Minister's Question Time (MQT)

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Roslan Hashim (PN-Kulim Bandar Baharu) will ask the Education Minister whether the ministry can facilitate the acquisition and purchase of ICT equipment for schools such as printers, laptops and PCs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will also be a question to the Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister by Datuk Seri Dr Wee Jeck Seng (BN-Tanjung Piai) on whether the ministry, through cooperation with various other ministries, is prepared to carry out tests on the production of biofuel from palm oil similar to what is being done by Indonesia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the question and answer session, the Dewan Rakyat will continue with the debate and winding up of the Supply Bill 2023 at the committee level

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Roslan Hashim (PN-Kulim Bandar Baharu) will ask the Education Minister whether the ministry can facilitate the acquisition and purchase of ICT equipment for schools such as printers, laptops and PCs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will also be a question to the Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister by Datuk Seri Dr Wee Jeck Seng (BN-Tanjung Piai) on whether the ministry, through cooperation with various other ministries, is prepared to carry out tests on the production of biofuel from palm oil similar to what is being done by Indonesia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the question and answer session, the Dewan Rakyat will continue with the debate and winding up of the Supply Bill 2023 at the committee level

                More info A successful Qatar-led takeover of Manchester United could reportedly face significant resistance from elsewhere in the Premier League if Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani's investment group buys the club from the Glazer family in the near future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sheikh Jassim is thought to be incredibly keen on purchasing United but faces stiff competition from Ineos chief and boyhood Red Devils supporter Jim Ratcliffe, with both parties expected to table new offers for the club before the end of this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the big question will be whether the Qatari proposal will manage to surpass Ratcliffe's valuation of United and ultimately tempt the Glazers into selling up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Qatar-led group is expected to 'significantly increase' its offer to buy the club later this week, according to The Independent, although a successful takeover could risk a huge backlash from other Premier League sides if it goes ahead over the coming months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is still a possibility that any new investors could arrive in the form of minority shareholders, which would see United's current owners retain at least some say in how the club is run

                Trump supporters were scheduled to protest in America’s financial capital later yesterday, as a grand jury weighs an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg over the 2016 payment to Stormy Daniels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Trump would become the first former or sitting president to be charged with a crime if an indictment is filed — a move that would send shockwaves through the 2024 White House race, in which the 76-year-old is running to regain office
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an online group named “The Donald,” some Trump supporters called for a “national strike” and “Civil War 2.0” to protect Trump and protest any arrest

            <p>
                But there was no indication of a large movement and figureheads for Trump like his sons and leading commentators have not openly urged action in the streets as they did after the 2020 election, when President Joe Biden defeated Trump
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Trump’s many legal woes Bragg’s inquiry centres on US$130,000 (RM583,180) paid weeks before the 2016 polls to stop Daniels from going public about an affair she says she had with Trump years earlier

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 — Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Datuk Seri Salahuddin Ayub said he would raise in Cabinet his proposal to compensate billionaires who help pay for “affordable hypermarkets” catering to low-income earners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the minister, the idea was that these “affordable hypermarkets” would offer basic goods and essentials at up to 30 per cent less than the typical market price, specifically to cater to the low-income population
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for an online version, Salahuddin said e-commerce firm Shopee has launched “Jualan Rahmah Shopee” offering various types of basic necessities with up to 40 per cent discount
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 7, Salahuddin proposed that the government create a hypermarket to sell good at affordable prices, saying it could engage the private sector for the project as a form of corporate social responsibility
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Answering the prime minister’s call, Salahuddin launched the “Menu Rahmah” initiative for the private sector to offer balanced meals for no more than RM5 each — without any government subsidy — as a short-term measure to ease the financial burden of Malaysians
            </p>

                Apart from Menu Rahmah, Jualan Rahmah is another initiative by Salahuddin’s ministry to offer basic essential goods at a discounted price

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 — Seven months after Loh Siew Hong cleared the first legal hurdle last year to challenge her three children’s unilateral conversion to Islam without her consent, the Hindu mother will finally have her day in court today and her case merits will be heard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In August, the High Court had granted Loh leave for her judicial review against the children’s unilateral conversion by her ex-husband without her consent and she is contesting that they were incapable of embracing Islam without her consent in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She is also seeking a declaration that the Perlis state’s legal provision that allows for one parent to unilaterally convert a child is unconstitutional
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under Order 53, rule 3(6) of the Rules of Court, an application for judicial review shall be made promptly and in any event within three months from the date when the grounds of the application first arose or when the decision is first communicated to the applicant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loh’s lawyer had then informed the court of their client’s discovery over the children’s conversion only when both sides reunited in February 2022, following which leave for the current judicial review bid was filed the following month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the June 2022 decision was set aside at the Court of Appeal in a three-judge panel’s unanimous decision in February this year, that would allow MAIP to file anew a bid to intervene for the purpose of varying a custody order granted to Loh.

                First Republic’s stock has tumbled 90% over the past month, with almost all of the losses occurring since March 8, the day Silicon Valley Bank announced stock sale plans and sparked what would turn into a $42 billion bank run and a subsequent seizure by federal regulators

                Withdrawals slowed somewhat last week after a consortium of 11 banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, banded together and on Thursday announced a $30 billion deposit at First Republic to help stabilize it

                — AP Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha dissolved the country’s parliament, setting up a general election in May as the former coup leader seeks to extend army-backed rule

                (Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson said the stress in the banking system marks what’s likely to be the beginning of a painful and “vicious” end to the bear market in US stocks

                Indira Gandhi and two women who claimed to be victims of unilateral conversion to Islam are amongst 14 plaintiffs who have filed a legal challenge against eight state governments over state laws that allowed unilateral conversion without the consent of both parents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indira, Aisyah Muhammad Ali, Mimi Mastura Abdullah, and 11 others filed the originating summons at the High Court here on March 3

            <p>
                Indira and the others were seeking for a court declaration that the state enactments which allowed the unilateral conversion of children into Islam as invalid as it violated Article 12(4) of the Federal Constitution and other matters interpreted in the Indira Gandhi case in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plaintiffs also sought for a declaration that unilateral conversion was unconstitutional and breached Article 12(4) as well as other reliefs deemed fit by the court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 29, 2018, the Federal Court nullified the unilateral conversion of Indira's three children to Islam by her ex-husband Muhammad Riduan Abdullah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Mimi Mastura claimed she was converted to Islam by her mother in Johor Bahru, Johor, when she was 10 and without the consent of her father

                Najib said Dr Mahathir should not be calling others a dictator when he himself was oppressive during his two tenures as prime minister in a post on his Facebook on Sunday (March 20) "Who was the one who enforced the Internal Security Act (ISA) and changed the country's Attorney General, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief and Chief Justice for his own benefit?" he asked

                On Sunday (March 20), Dr Mahathir had denounced Anwar as an oppressive leader after his plan to hold a pro-Malay gathering failed to materialise.

                Presented with Reuters findings, Dow and Sport Singapore opened an investigation and later terminated the contract of Yok Impex, a local textile exporter that was subcontracted to collect shoes from donation bins

                The 68-year-old Prayut, who cemented his rule in a controversial election in 2019, has demonstrated a longevity that is rare in Thai politics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in a poll published Sunday of who voters would like to see as PM, Prayut lagged in third place at just over 15 percent -- way behind front-runner Paetongtarn at 38 percent

            <p>
                In the same poll of 2,000 people, conducted by the National Institute of Development Administration, nearly 50 percent said they would vote Pheu Thai, with Prayut's United Thai Nation party on around 12 percent

                Kim's remarks came as the isolated country conducted what KCNA called exercises aimed at bolstering its "war deterrence and nuclear counterattack capability" on Saturday and Sunday to send strong warnings against the allies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the exercises, a ballistic missile equipped with a mock nuclear warhead flew 800km before hitting a target at the altitude of 800m under the scenario of a tactical nuclear attack, KCNA said

                South Korea and Japan reported a launch of a North Korean short-range ballistic missile off the east coast on Sunday, the latest in a series of missile tests in recent weeks

            <p>
                North Korea has reacted furiously to South Korea-US combined military drills, calling them a rehearsal for invasion against it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last month, the two countries staged tabletop exercises simulating North Korea's nuclear attack amid South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's push for more confidence in US extended deterrence - its military capability, especially nuclear forces, to deter attacks on its allies

                Kim's remarks came as the isolated country conducted what KCNA called exercises aimed at bolstering its "war deterrence and nuclear counterattack capability" on Saturday and Sunday to send strong warnings against the allies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the exercises, a ballistic missile equipped with a mock nuclear warhead flew 800km before hitting a target at the altitude of 800m under the scenario of a tactical nuclear attack, KCNA said

            <p>
                South Korea and Japan reported a launch of a North Korean short-range ballistic missile off the east coast on Sunday, the latest in a series of missile tests in recent weeks

                North Korea has reacted furiously to South Korea-US combined military drills, calling them a rehearsal for invasion against it

            <p>
                Last month, the two countries staged tabletop exercises simulating North Korea's nuclear attack amid South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's push for more confidence in US extended deterrence - its military capability, especially nuclear forces, to deter attacks on its allies

                Gold prices dropped on Monday, with their safe-haven appeal diminished as risk sentiment improved after Swiss lender UBS sealed a deal to buy peer Credit Suisse in a rescue effort to stabilize global financial markets

                Indira Gandhi have filed a lawsuit against eight laws enabling unilateral conversion to Islam in seven states and Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the lawsuit, Indira and the 13 others are seeking for the High Court to declare the state enactments which allow the unilateral conversion of children into Islam as being void or invalid due to its breaching of the Federal Constitution, especially Article 12(4) and in light of the Federal Court’s 2018 decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other court orders that Indira and the 13 others are seeking include a declaration that the practice of unilateral conversion is unconstitutional and contrary to Article 12(4)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the High Court declares the state laws enabling unilateral conversion to be invalid and declares unilateral conversion to be an unconstitutional practice, Indira and the 13 others are seeking for a further declaration that any and all unilateral conversions that took place in Malaysia before the Federal Court’s January 2018 decision in Indira’s case to be void or invalid for breaching Article 12(4)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alternatively if the first two orders are granted, they want the court to require any and all unilateral conversions in Malaysia — after the Federal Court’s 2018 Indira decision — to require the consent of both parents, and to reverse the unilateral conversion of these children if either parent refuses to grant consent within a one-year period from the date of the court’s order in this lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aisyah cited the Federal Constitution’s Article 4(1) which states the Federal Constitution to be Malaysia’s supreme law and states that any law inconsistent with it shall be made void or invalid, and also cited Article 75 where the federal law will prevail if any state law is inconsistent with federal laws

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 — The police will be calling Youth and Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh for her statement as part of the investigation into the ‘Jom Ziarah Gereja’ programme organised by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) under her ministry

                The police have received two reports on the issue, Sentul police chief ACP Beh Eng Lai was quoted as saying by Sinar Harian
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have recorded the statements of three individuals, including two complainants and two NGO representatives to aid investigations,” he was quoted as saying during a press conference yesterday at the Sentul District Police Station after 216th Police Day celebrations

            <p>
                Yesterday, national news agency Bernama reported that the police have opened an investigation paper on the ‘Jom Ziarah Gereja’ programme, which was scheduled for Saturday before it was cancelled

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 — The police will be calling Youth and Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh for her statement as part of the investigation into the ‘Jom Ziarah Gereja’ programme organised by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) under her ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The police have received two reports on the issue, Sentul police chief ACP Beh Eng Lai was quoted as saying by Sinar Harian
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have recorded the statements of three individuals, including two complainants and two NGO representatives to aid investigations,” he was quoted as saying during a press conference yesterday at the Sentul District Police Station after 216th Police Day celebrations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, national news agency Bernama reported that the police have opened an investigation paper on the ‘Jom Ziarah Gereja’ programme, which was scheduled for Saturday before it was cancelled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Segambut MP has since lodged a police report through her political secretary over the allegations

            <p>
                The organiser of the programme, Impact Malaysia, describes itself as a social impact initiative of Impact Integrated, an agency under the Youth and Sport Ministry

                Analysts have widely downgraded their earnings forecasts for Top Glove, after the group posted a cumulative net loss of RM332 million for the first half ended Feb 28, 2023 (1HFY2023)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the second-quarter result announcement, the market consensus for Top Glove's annual net loss is now estimated at RM435 million for FY2023 — compared with an annual net loss of RM303 million prior to the release of the latest results
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, HLIB estimated the group to post a wider annual net loss of RM409.2 million for FY2023, from a projected RM274.2 million previously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                HLIB also expects Top Glove to continue bleeding in FY2024, with an annual net loss of RM66.3 million, against an estimated net profit of RM74.4 million previously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For FY2025, HLIB  expects the group to deliver a smaller annual net profit of RM174.3 million, against an estimated net profit of RM182 million previously

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 — Kepong MP Lim Lip Eng today announced he has already reached the RM2.25 million target which he was trying to crowdfund to pay for compensation and court-ordered costs for a defamation lawsuit against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Friday, Lim had on Facebook launched the fundraising effort to pay for the RM2 million compensation and RM250,000 legal costs, which the High Court had ordered him to pay to local company MonSpace (M) Sdn Bhd and its founder Datuk Seri Jessy Lai in a defamation lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim said he had been helping investment scam victims without fear over the years and had also tried in 2016 to help a group of individuals who asked him for help but ended up with a lawsuit where he was ordered to pay RM2.25 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Friday, Lim had promised to donate the entire sum to charitable and educational bodies when his appeal succeeds and the RM2.25 million sum is returned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When contacted by Malay Mail on Friday, Lim’s lawyer Guok Ngek Seong confirmed that an appeal had been filed on Thursday against the High Court’s decision and that preparations were being made to apply for a stay order to suspend the High Court order until the Court of Appeal decides on the appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim and Sungai Pelek assemblyman Ronnie Liu Tian Khiew had gone with 19 Chinese nationals, who claimed they were victims of the MonSpace investment scheme, to the company headquarters to demand a refund or an explanation on why their investment had not materialised.

                As such, the new policy on the Political Funding Bill has to be brought to the Cabinet for its approval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 7, the previous administration agreed in principle to the law on political funding when the Bill was presented to the Cabinet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although political funding laws were mooted in 2016 by the then National Consultative Committee on Political Financing, there was resistance from several quarters, including Pakatan Harapan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee came up with 32 recommendations to address the lack of laws on transparent political funding, including the creation of the Office of the Controller of Political Donations and a ban on cash donations from foreign sources
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2019, the Pakatan administration said it intended to table laws on political funding but could not do so after it collapsed in February 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azalina said on Monday the proposed Political Funding Bill will also be brought before the relevant Parliamentary Special Select Committees before being tabled in the Dewan Rakyat

                As such, the new policy on the Political Funding Bill has to be brought to the Cabinet for its approval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 7, the previous administration agreed in principle to the law on political funding when the Bill was presented to the Cabinet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although political funding laws were mooted in 2016 by the then National Consultative Committee on Political Financing, there was resistance from several quarters, including Pakatan Harapan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee came up with 32 recommendations to address the lack of laws on transparent political funding, including the creation of the Office of the Controller of Political Donations and a ban on cash donations from foreign sources
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2019, the Pakatan administration said it intended to table laws on political funding but could not do so after it collapsed in February 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azalina said on Monday the proposed Political Funding Bill will also be brought before the relevant Parliamentary Special Select Committees before being tabled in the Dewan Rakyat

                House officers at Sungai Buloh Hospital’s OB-GYN department accuse medical officers of perpetrating a “tradition” of bullying in the department, including sexual harassment, sexist slurs, and denial of annual leave and meal and rest breaks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a letter to CodeBlue last Wednesday, a complainant identifying as a representative of UD41 house officers in the public hospital’s OB-GYN department detailed allegations of everyday mistreatment against “all” housemen at the department by senior doctors

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2018, an orthopaedic head of department in Sungai Buloh Hospital was terminated from public service, after the completion of an inquiry by a special investigation committee into female house officers’ sexual harassment allegations against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The majority (83 per cent) of house officers (64 people) who reported workplace bullying in CodeBlue’s survey are working at MOH hospitals, while 17 per cent work at university hospitals (13 people)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 41 per cent prevalence of workplace bullying among trainee doctors in CodeBlue’s poll is also more than five times higher than the 7.4 per cent reported in the Healthcare Work Culture Improvement Task Force (HWCITF) poll of over 110,000 respondents across 30 service schemes in the MOH

            <p>
                The North's drills involved a short-range missile launch but - unusually - the missile flew from a buried silo, which analysts say would help improve speed and stability in future tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM)

                KCNA said the exercises on Saturday and Sunday were designed to boost the country's "war deterrence and nuclear counterattack capability," accusing Washington and Seoul of making an "explicit attempt to unleash a war" against it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the exercises, a ballistic missile equipped with a mock nuclear warhead flew 800 km (497 miles) before hitting a target under the scenario of a tactical nuclear attack, KCNA said

            <p>
                Italian source Inter Live suggested earlier this month that Liverpool was tracking the player, and now Calciomercatoweb is also speculating that Arsenal has joined in on the race to sign Bennacer, who was a former Arsenal youth product at one time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bennacer would be on the list of potential Liverpool midfielders, but likely further down, with Bellingham the number one target.

                Liverpool interested in Lazio star Liverpool is now interested in signing Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinković-Savić

            <p>
                Italian source Inter Live suggested earlier this month that Liverpool was tracking the player, and now Calciomercatoweb is also speculating that Arsenal has joined in on the race to sign Bennacer, who was a former Arsenal youth product at one time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bennacer would be on the list of potential Liverpool midfielders, but likely further down, with Bellingham the number one target.

            <p>
                “So I’m really happy to regain this love for badminton here (in Birmingham).’’ And Zii Jia admitted the undying support from his fans was another reason for enjoying the game again

            <p>
                “Birmingham is special as I’ve always received strong support from all the fans here, even when I played here during the Covid-19 pandemic (in 2020 and 2021) and this has made me fall in love with the sport again,” said Zii Jia

            <p>
                Zii Jia has always managed to rise to the occasion in the All-England, having reached the semi-finals in his previous outings in 2020 and 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “These are for my overall development in the future and not just when I face Yuqi again.” Zii Jia’s next assignment will be the Swiss Open which starts tomorrow in Basel

                Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi speaking at the UMNO Candidate Introduction Ceremony for the Pahang 2023-2026 Election on Mar 15, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid, who is also the UMNO president, said that based on the 2023 UMNO Election which ended on Saturday, it was evident that every level of the national leadership and grassroots were clearly in support of the unity government led by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid expressed confidence that apart from the support from UMNO and other BN component parties, parties from Sabah and Sarawak under the unity government will continue to support the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                UMNO party polls for the new term were originally set to be held before Dec 30 last year, which is 18 months after the previous term ended on June 30, 2021.  However, the UMNO general assembly in Mar 2022 agreed to postpone party polls up to six months after the GE15 to allow the party to focus on winning the people’s mandate.  Elections for the president and deputy president posts were not held as a motion was passed by the UMNO General Assembly on Jan 14 this year to leave the party's top two posts unchallenged.  The motion had polarised debate during the party convention
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some delegates supported it in the name of party unity, while others felt that the roles of president and deputy president should be open to challenge after UMNO’s poor showing during the November 2022 national polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Party president Ahmad Zahid and his deputy, Mohamad Hasan, will serve at least another term in the party.  Additional reporting by Rhea Yasmine Bte Alis Haizan.

                João Félix has depicted shades of Roberto Firmino during his Chelsea loan spell and Liverpool should be looking to poach his services from under Todd Boehly's nose
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He's shown real class and elegance on the ball, and it is interesting from a Liverpool perspective that Chelsea does not have an option to buy in the deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The relationship between him and the boss, the minutes played, his motivation right now, it makes you think that the reasonable thing is that if there's an option that's good for the player, good for the club, we can look at it." The uncertain future surrounding Félix should grab the attention of Klopp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cody Gakpo has been doing his best impression since moving to Merseyside from PSV Eindhoven two months ago, but Félix appears to be more of a natural heir to Firmino's illustrious throne
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp also seems eager to attract Mason Mount to Anfield from the Bridge this summer, and Félix could be another who fits the theme
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An overhaul is very much on the agenda for Liverpool in the coming months and — if the price is right — Félix has the subtle technical qualities to form part of Klopp's next great team.

                The England captain is one of United’s top targets as Ten Hag looks to sign a new striker.

                In a note dated March 15, UBS analysts indicated that the wider financial market turbulence was unlikely to affect crude oil production rates, but flagged that "during periods of elevated volatility, investors tend to pull out of risky assets like oil and invest in safer corners of the market." It added that the options market is now intensifying the decline in oil prices through delta-hedging plays.  Citing "banking stress, recession fears, and an exodus of investor flows," analysts at Goldman Sachs on March 18 cut their oil price outlook, now expecting Brent prices to hit $94 per barrel in the upcoming 12 months and $97 per barrel over the second half of 2024 — compared with previous projections at $100 per barrel for both periods

                In a note dated March 15, UBS analysts indicated that the wider financial market turbulence was unlikely to affect crude oil production rates, but flagged that "during periods of elevated volatility, investors tend to pull out of risky assets like oil and invest in safer corners of the market."

                by Mark Worwood Shares Hong Kong Derby-winning trainer Ricky Yiu Poon-fai saddles four runners at Happy Valley on Wednesday, including last-start victor Reach Goal, and he is the city’s hottest handler – no matter how you do the math
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No trainer has celebrated more wins this month than Yiu, whose March tally of nine eclipses John Size’s total by two
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No trainer has celebrated more wins this year than Yiu, whose 2023 score of 24 exceeds Size’s sum by one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mighty Stride is MIGHTY impressive! Ricky Yiu bags a double, as does @HugeBowman..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are no eight-figure cheques up for grabs in any of Wednesday’s nine races at Happy Valley, but Reach Goal is a live chance for Yiu and Silvestre de Sousa in the Class Four Staunton Handicap (1,800m) as he seeks to build on his March 1 victory over 2,200m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reach Goal outstays them all! 💪 @SilvDSousa takes the stayers race at the Valley for Ricky Yiu

                by Mark Worwood Shares Hong Kong Derby-winning trainer Ricky Yiu Poon-fai saddles four runners at Happy Valley on Wednesday, including last-start victor Reach Goal, and he is the city’s hottest handler – no matter how you do the math
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No trainer has celebrated more wins this month than Yiu, whose March tally of nine eclipses John Size’s total by two
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No trainer has celebrated more wins this year than Yiu, whose 2023 score of 24 exceeds Size’s sum by one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mighty Stride is MIGHTY impressive! Ricky Yiu bags a double, as does @HugeBowman..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are no eight-figure cheques up for grabs in any of Wednesday’s nine races at Happy Valley, but Reach Goal is a live chance for Yiu and Silvestre de Sousa in the Class Four Staunton Handicap (1,800m) as he seeks to build on his March 1 victory over 2,200m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reach Goal outstays them all! 💪 @SilvDSousa takes the stayers race at the Valley for Ricky Yiu

                Arsenal remain locked in a fierce Premier League title race with Manchester City after Mikel Arteta's side moved eight points clear at the top of the table with a win against Crystal Palace on Sunday Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters A supercomputer has provided a fresh prediction on Arsenal's Premier League title race against Manchester City heading into the final 10 games of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                City were not in Premier League action as they progressed into the FA Cup semi-finals with an emphatic 6-0 win against Burnley
            </p>
            
            <p>
                City have beaten Arsenal twice so far this season, once in the FA Cup and once in the Premier League, but the Gunners will hope they will get the better of the reigning champions in their third and final meeting next month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BETSiE's projections predict Arsenal to end their 19-year wait for a Premier League title, with City set to finish second
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prediction has the Gunners winning the league with 87.8 points, ahead of City on 83.8 points
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This would see Arsenal take 19 points from their final 10 remaining fixtures in the Premier League as they head into the international break with 69 points after winning 22 of their 28 games so far - the most they have ever achieved in their first 28 matches of a league campaign

                Erik ten Hag's side have a knack for managing to win matches even when they aren't at their best, though their latest comeback win was more about Fulham's implosion than it was about their own ability on the day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has made nine signings during his time at United, but only three of them started against Fulham, and two of those were temporary fixes targeted in January to serve a short-term purpose

            <p>
                At the other end of the field, Antony was a thorn in Fulham's side, with his introduction helping to shift the momentum in United's favour even before the red card and penalty incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was a match in which the absence of Ten Hag's signings was not only felt heavily, but in which they wouldn't have won without the contributions of two permanent additions to his side either

                Kawasaki's 400cc parallel-twin platform has proven to be quite a capable machine for both beginner and veteran riders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was essentially the evolution of the Ninja 250, and is the latest iteration of Team Green's parallel-twin engine design following the Ninja 300 platform released previously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What is happening, though, is Kawasaki's entry into the entry-level cruiser segment with the revival of the Eliminator nameplate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of now, the new bike is available only in Japan, and yes, it's built around the 400cc platform.  Kawasaki has launched the Eliminator 400 in the Japanese market in two versions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the new Eliminator 400 does share a few similarities with this bigger cruiser, it does have a style of its own, leaning towards a more retro aesthetic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That said, it does resemble the Honda Rebel 500 quite a bit, especially in its Spark Black Metallic colorway, and might be easily mistaken for Big Red's beginner-friendly cruiser.  The Kawasaki Eliminator 400 has some really friendly proportions, with a low seat height of just 735 millimeters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For reference, it retails for 759,000 Yen, around $5,732 USD, in standard trim

                Commenting on two-time prime minister and ex-Pejuang chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad's recent claims about Malays losing political and economic power and casting doubts on Anwar's capability to lead the country, Loke said Pakatan Harapan was disappointed by his narrative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "His statements are being perceived as causing disunity among the multiracial population of the country," he said at the Penang DAP convention at Butterworth Arena here on Sunday (March 19)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We hope he can play his role more constructively, rather than issue statements that not only do not help but also fan racial sentiments, which is bad for our country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir, 97, lost his Langkawi parliamentary seat and deposit in the recent general election, left Pejuang - which is now leaning towards Perikatan Nasional - and joined Parti Bumiputera Perkasa Malaysia (Putra)

                Commenting on two-time prime minister and ex-Pejuang chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad's recent claims about Malays losing political and economic power and casting doubts on Anwar's capability to lead the country, Loke said Pakatan Harapan was disappointed by his narrative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "His statements are being perceived as causing disunity among the multiracial population of the country," he said at the Penang DAP convention at Butterworth Arena here on Sunday (March 19)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We hope he can play his role more constructively, rather than issue statements that not only do not help but also fan racial sentiments, which is bad for our country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir, 97, lost his Langkawi parliamentary seat and deposit in the recent general election, left Pejuang - which is now leaning towards Perikatan Nasional - and joined Parti Bumiputera Perkasa Malaysia (Putra)

            <p>
                The Perak Mentri Besar, who did not give a specific number, said most of them were referred to the party's disciplinary board and subsequently sacked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his speech at the Lenggong division's annual general meeting on Saturday (March 18), Saarani said sabotage from within was among the factors that cost the party heavily in GE15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saarani, who retained the Lenggong chairman's post uncontested, said those who were victorious in party elections should not sideline those who lost

                On another matter, Saarani said there was no gender discrimination when appointing people to decision-making posts in Perak

                “Of course, this is the most prestigious race in Hong Kong racing, and I’m very, very happy and grateful to win this Derby race,” said Yiu after winning the event at his eighth attempt

                Voyage Bubble made all from gate five under Jamie Kah to win the Classic Mile on January 29, but Yiu issued Alexis Badel with starkly contrasting Derby riding instructions from barrier 14 on Sunday

                This horse is very versatile – over the mile or 2,000m

            <p>
                While he’s at his peak, we’ll run him in a month’s time over a shorter trip,” Yiu said when asked about his plans for Voyage Bubble, who has won five of his 11 starts

                Voyage Bubble, who the veteran handler bought for A$380,000 three years ago, supplies the 2019-20 champion with his first victory in the race

                “Of course, this is the most prestigious race in Hong Kong racing, and I’m very, very happy and grateful to win this Derby race,” said Yiu after winning the event at his eighth attempt

                Voyage Bubble made all from gate five under Jamie Kah to win the Classic Mile on January 29, but Yiu issued Alexis Badel with starkly contrasting Derby riding instructions from barrier 14 on Sunday

                In response to a question on how her visit could strengthen bilateral ties between Singapore and Malaysia, the President stated that she will meet with the Agong and other important Malaysian officials during her stay to assess "our complete bilateral agenda, explore new areas of cooperation, and reiterate Singapore’s abiding interest to develop a stable, win-win partnership with Malaysia for the long-term." She also pointed to the digital and green economies as well as cybersecurity as agreed earlier by both sides as areas that can be developed and explored further to expand bilateral collaboration and cooperation

                Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, waves from the vehicle as he leaves from Lahore to appear before Islamabad High Court, in Lahore, Pakistan March 18, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move followed days of standoff and intense clashes between police and his supporters around the property, where police had attempted to arrest Khan on Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Khan said in a Tweet that his wife was at the property
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was appearing in court after expressing fear of arrest
            </p>

            <p>
                Sivakumar said the approval of the foreign worker quotas so far is expected to meet the needs of foreign workers by industry, including in critical sectors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thus, he said, the Government decided to postpone the application and approval of the foreign worker quota, including through the Foreign Worker Employment Relaxation Plan (FWERP), starting on March 18 until a date to be announced later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is to ensure that employers who have been granted quota approval will start making plans for the immediate entry of the required foreign workers,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the statement on Saturday (March 18), he said the quota approval for employers in the construction sector involved 342,106 permits, service sector (restaurants only)(143,568), manufacturing sector (387,122), plantation sector (76,325), mining and quarrying sector (376), and agriculture sector (45,899)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He urged employers with approved foreign worker quotas to speed up the hiring of workers during this period

                Sivakumar said the approval of the foreign worker quotas so far is expected to meet the needs of foreign workers by industry, including in critical sectors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thus, he said, the Government decided to postpone the application and approval of the foreign worker quota, including through the Foreign Worker Employment Relaxation Plan (FWERP), starting on March 18 until a date to be announced later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is to ensure that employers who have been granted quota approval will start making plans for the immediate entry of the required foreign workers,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the statement on Saturday (March 18), he said the quota approval for employers in the construction sector involved 342,106 permits, service sector (restaurants only)(143,568), manufacturing sector (387,122), plantation sector (76,325), mining and quarrying sector (376), and agriculture sector (45,899)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He urged employers with approved foreign worker quotas to speed up the hiring of workers during this period

                Former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces fraud charges over the collapse of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, arrives for a hearing at a federal court in New York on Feb 9, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a letter filed on Friday (Mar 17) night in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried's lawyer Christian Everdell said that both sides believed they were "close to a resolution" and expect to formally propose new restrictions by next week

                Bankman-Fried's lawyers have said that their client was trying to help, not interfere

            <p>
                In Friday's letter, Everdell also sought the judge's permission to let Bankman-Fried in the meantime use a laptop to access some FTX materials
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though the laptop would lack monitoring software or restrict Bankman-Fried's Internet access, a lawyer or paralegal would oversee his use and take the laptop away when Bankman-Fried finished with it, Everdell said.

                A delegation for Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani's bid to buy Manchester United, and Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his entourage have both held in-depth meetings with club officials this week Both leading parties in the race to buy Manchester United are set to submit second offers to the Glazers next week after each holding positive meetings with club officials

                A Qatari delegation for Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani's bid visited Manchester on Thursday, spending 10 hours with United chiefs as they discussed a range of subjects in depth relating to both on and off the field matters

            <p>
                Greeted by United chief executive Richard Arnold at the players' entrance of Old Trafford just before 10am on Friday morning, Ratcliffe was joined by INEOS director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford, formerly the supremo of British Cycling and Team Sky

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lucas was named Liverpool's Young Player of the Year in 2010 and Fans' player of the year in 2011

                The Thai Rice Exporter Association recently raised concerns and demanded solutions after a rice mill in China was found to be producing fake jasmine rice and using a Thai brand name to deceive customers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The President of the Thai Rice Exporter Association, Chukiat Opassawong, revealed in an interview with KhaoSod that the rice mill in China had been producing fake Thai jasmine rice by adding a flavouring agent and using Thai language on the packaging and branding

            <p>
                During the World’s Best Rice event in Phuket last year, Paka Lamduan rice from Cambodia was named the world’s best rice in 2022, defeating Thai jasmine rice, which came in second place, followed by rice from Vietnam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a report on WorkPoint Today, the judge, an American chef, noted that both Thai and Cambodian rice had good qualities, but Cambodian rice offered a better aroma than Thai rice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Thai customers and farmers expressed concerns that the quality of Thai jasmine rice had declined due to the use of pesticides and chemical substances

                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa said that the 150-year-old hospital accommodates about 50,000 inpatient services at its wards each year, which reflects the commitment of its staff

                It is revealed during the briefing by HKL director Datin Paduka Dr Rohana Johan that the hospital still relies on the manual method to store about 16,000 patients' data in a day, which is stored at its Wisma Kayu

            <p>
                According to the charge sheet, Bedwell and Hoi had cheated an Austrian, Trevor Ronald John Curtis, into handing them A$8,991.92 (RM27,044) by promising a high profit in a short period of time through the purchase of shares in Devon Energy Corporation

                Once a victim shows interest, the caller will send an email containing a fake prospectus with details of the company and if the victim agrees to purchase the “shares”, the caller will provide a bank account number for the victim to submit payment for the purchase of the shares

            <p>
                Bedwell, with Yazdi, contacted Walker on January 5 this year where she was similarly scammed into transferring A$8,573 into the same bank account number
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) conducted an operation on February 21 at several of the boiler rooms in Penang and Klang Valley where Bedwell and Hoi were arrested

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, March 17 — Crystal Palace sacked manager Patrick Vieira after 20 months in charge today after their 1-0 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion left them three points above the Premier League relegation zone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Palace are the only side in the league without a win in 2023, having drawn five and lost six of their games

            <p>
                “Results in recent months have placed us in a precarious league position and we felt a change is necessary to give us the best chance of retaining Premier League status.” Former France international Vieira, who captained Arsenal to three league titles and four FA Cups as a player, took over from Roy Hodgson in July 2021 on a three-year contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wednesday’s defeat at Brighton was their third in a row and marked the 13th league game they failed to score
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Patrick has given his all to the club, and we all thank him and his team for their service.” Vieira also won the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European Championship as a player with France

                China's central bank said on Friday it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the first time this year to help keep liquidity ample and support a nascent economic recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for all banks, except those that have implemented a 5% reserve ratio, by 25 basis points (bps), effective March 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank said the cut reflected its intention to "make a good combination of macro policies, improve the level of services for the real economy, and keep liquidity reasonably sufficient in the banking system." The central bank has promised to make its policy "precise and forceful" this year to support the economy, keeping liquidity reasonably ample and lowering funding costs for businesses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The weighted average RRR for financial institutions stood at around 7.6% after the cut, the central bank said

            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, Russia violated international law when it failed to act with “due regard” for the US right to engage in freedom of overflight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And it is presumably on this basis that the State Department spokesman called the drone’s downing a “brazen violation of international law”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Freedom of overflight in international airspace includes the act of monitoring activities inside another state’s territory, as long as the monitoring occurs from within international airspace

                Sundra Rajoo has withdrawn his suit against the former Attorney General Tan Sri Tommy Thomas and 12 other parties over his wrongful arrest and prosecution in relation to the AIAC breach of trust case

                “Malaysia wishes to note that the stay order granted on July 12, 2022, is an exceptional decision and serves to reinforce Malaysia’s position that the purported commercial arbitration instituted by the Sulu claimants is without legitimate basis and does affect Malaysia’s territorial sovereignty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In February last year, the Paris Court of Arbitration through arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa ordered Malaysia to pay US$14.9bil to the self-proclaimed heirs of the Sulu Sultanate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stampa, who was stopped by Spanish courts from hearing the case, had moved the arbitration to Paris to make his decision in Paris
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Malaysia managed to obtain a stay order on Stampa’s controversial award from French courts after filing a request for a stay of the enforcement of the purported final award in April 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Subsequently, on July 12, 2022, the pre-trial judge of the Paris Court of Appeal ordered the unconditional stay of enforcement in France of the purported final award pending the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal on the set-aside proceedings, on the ground that it will likely affect Malaysia’s territorial sovereignty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 27, 2022, the Sulu claimants filed a challenge against the stay order, to which the hearing on the merits was held on Jan 16, 2023.

                Russia has denied responsibility for the incident, which the United States says left its drone uncontrollable and required it to be brought down in the Black Sea

                The Pentagon said the drone was on a routine mission when it was intercepted — a term that refers to one aircraft making visual or electronic contact with another — in a “reckless” and “unprofessional manner.” The incident has ratcheted up tensions between Moscow and Western allies, already soaring over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but top security officials from the United States and Russia have been in touch

                MANCHESTER CITY star Julian Alvarez has signed a new long-term contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For a club like City to put their faith in me like this is amazing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I know I can be better, and City offer me everything I need to fulfil my potential
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I am now focused on getting better and helping City win trophies.” Alvarez joined City in a £17million deal last summer and has mostly acted as an understudy to the prolific Erling Haaland

                In a statement on Friday (March 17), Bursa said that BCX enables the trading of standardised contracts with underlying carbon credits from climate-friendly projects and solutions, which corporates can use to offset emission footprint and meet climate goals
            </p>
            
            <p>

                In a statement on Friday (March 17), Bursa said that BCX enables the trading of standardised contracts with underlying carbon credits from climate-friendly projects and solutions, which corporates can use to offset emission footprint and meet climate goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With this key milestone, the auction facilitated the price-discovery of carbon credits from two new products offered by the BCX — the Global Technology-Based Carbon Contract (GTC) and the Global Nature-Based Plus Carbon Contract (GNC+),” Bursa said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, GNC+ fetched a clearing price of RM68 per contract, featuring carbon credits from the Southern Cardamom Project, which is a REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) project from Cambodia that comes with climate, community and biodiversity (CCB) standard that provides additional co-benefits, contributing to the livelihoods of local communities and biodiversity conservation in the Indo-Burma Biodiversity Hotspot.  "Both projects were carefully selected and curated to spur local interest in similar carbon offsetting project development

            <p>
                “We are very pleased with the successful execution of this inaugural auction, which has raised the awareness level of VCM and carbon offsetting opportunities in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By establishing a market-based price for carbon credits, the auction provides a clear signal to potential project proponents and developers on the economic viability of carbon credits, he noted

                He said the state government will identify a site for the construction of the velodrome, but it would most likely be near the sports complex in Petra Jaya

                Sam’s case will be heard in the Court of Appeal on March 31
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Court of Appeal has been informed in a video-conference during case management this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the prosecution appealed this verdict and in 2019, High Court judge Shahnaz Sulaiman sent the case back to the Magistrate’s Court for Sam to enter her defence on the reckless driving charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Magistrate Siti Hajar Ali, who heard the case in 2019 again discharged and acquitted Sam at the end of the defence case, prompting the prosecution to file a second appeal to the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sam obtained leave from the Court of Appeal last April 18 to appeal against her conviction and jail sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Court of Appeal had also allowed Sam’s application to stay the execution of the jail sentence and released her on bail of RM10,000 with one surety pending the appeal hearing.

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 17 — With an arrest warrant now out on him for failing to appear in court as a witness, Terengganu state executive councillor Mohd Nor Hamzah has explained that he had other prior commitments for the entire morning yesterday

                The Terengganu Election Court was yesterday scheduled to continue hearing Mohd Nor testify in a case involving Terengganu Umno’s election petition, which sought to annul the 15th general election (GE15) result where the Marang parliamentary seat was won by PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang

            <p>
                But taking to Facebook yesterday afternoon to clear the air about the “sensational news” regarding him, Mohd Nor said he had cooperated with the law firm representing BN’s GE15 candidate for Marang and had testified in court on Tuesday afternoon

                The first prediction is that mortgage rates could fall if the Federal Reserve backs off from future rate hikes, which Olsen writes "appeared imminent just weeks ago." Already, financial markets have pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.75%—down from last week's peak of 7.05%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the Fed doesn't issue a rate hike in March, some analysts think mortgage rates would sink even further
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For buyers shopping now—especially in high-priced areas—a sustained rate drop will be a welcome boost to affordability, but they should still plan on rate volatility." That said, if Silicon Valley Bank's collapse forewarns of a looming 2023 recession, Olsen writes the affordability gains from lower mortgage rates could be muted by economic pain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank, Olsen predicts, might mean more pain awaits tech-dominated housing markets like San Francisco, Boise, and Seattle

                Thursday Mar 16, 2023  Credit Suisse said on Thursday it would borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence, after a slump in its shares had intensified fears about a global banking crisis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Switzerland's second-largest bank said it would exercise an option to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the central bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That followed assurances from Swiss authorities on Wednesday that Credit Suisse met "the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks" and that it could access central bank liquidity if needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The concerns about Credit Suisse added to broader banking sector fears sparked by last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, two US mid-size firms
            </p>
            
            <p>
