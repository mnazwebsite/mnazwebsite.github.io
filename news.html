                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 — Several victims of the Kelana Jaya Light Rail Transit (LRT) train crash in 2021 are suing Prasarana Malaysia and Rapid Rail Sdn Bhd for damages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plaintiffs are claiming that both Prasarana and Rapid Rail did not ensure the trains were safe to use and that the accident happened due to negligence on their part
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the May 24, 2021 incident, a train ferrying 213 passengers collided with a faulty train which was being test-driven (autonomously) in a tunnel between the Kampung Baru and KLCC stations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former Pasir Salak MP Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman, who was Prasarana chairman at the time, faced heavy criticism for his lack of empathy, lack of professionalism and remarks made during a press conference following the crash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had described the accident as two trains “kissing” and was seen jovial during the press conference immediately following the incident
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 — Several victims of the Kelana Jaya Light Rail Transit (LRT) train crash in 2021 are suing Prasarana Malaysia and Rapid Rail Sdn Bhd for damages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plaintiffs are claiming that both Prasarana and Rapid Rail did not ensure the trains were safe to use and that the accident happened due to negligence on their part
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the May 24, 2021 incident, a train ferrying 213 passengers collided with a faulty train which was being test-driven (autonomously) in a tunnel between the Kampung Baru and KLCC stations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former Pasir Salak MP Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman, who was Prasarana chairman at the time, faced heavy criticism for his lack of empathy, lack of professionalism and remarks made during a press conference following the crash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had described the accident as two trains “kissing” and was seen jovial during the press conference immediately following the incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was subsequently sacked from his post on May 26, 2023 following an online petition calling for his termination as Prasarana chairman

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, March 27 — Economy minister Rafizi Ramli expressed confidence today Malaysia would be able to achieve an inflation rate of 3.3 per cent after Malaysia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February remained unchanged at 129.8 or 3.7 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There are signs showing we have surpassed peak inflation (as seen in September 2022) and we now have a chance to bring our inflation to between 3.1 to 3.3 per cent by year-end if the current trend continues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If our inflation rate decreases at a rate of 0.1 per cent bimonthly, we can achieve our target within 10 months,” he told a press conference this afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Department of Statistics Malaysia last week had in their statement said the food and non-alcoholic beverages group contributed 29.5 per cent of the total CPI, noting that out of the 230 food items, 203 items or 88.3 per cent recorded price increases
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The food at home component, which made up almost 58 per cent of the food and non-alcoholic beverages group, recorded a higher increase of 5.8 per cent, compared with 5.1 per cent in January 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time, food away from home recorded a lower increase of 8.9 per cent as against January 2023’s 9.3 per cent

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, March 27 — Economy minister Rafizi Ramli expressed confidence today Malaysia would be able to achieve an inflation rate of 3.3 per cent after Malaysia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February remained unchanged at 129.8 or 3.7 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There are signs showing we have surpassed peak inflation (as seen in September 2022) and we now have a chance to bring our inflation to between 3.1 to 3.3 per cent by year-end if the current trend continues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If our inflation rate decreases at a rate of 0.1 per cent bimonthly, we can achieve our target within 10 months,” he told a press conference this afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Department of Statistics Malaysia last week had in their statement said the food and non-alcoholic beverages group contributed 29.5 per cent of the total CPI, noting that out of the 230 food items, 203 items or 88.3 per cent recorded price increases
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The food at home component, which made up almost 58 per cent of the food and non-alcoholic beverages group, recorded a higher increase of 5.8 per cent, compared with 5.1 per cent in January 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time, food away from home recorded a lower increase of 8.9 per cent as against January 2023’s 9.3 per cent
            </p>

                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa (pic) said the implementation of the HTAR and Bandar Botanik Health Clinic cluster pilot project started last Saturday (March 25) as agreed upon by the Special Task Force on Agency Reform (STAR)

                "This is because the Emergency and Trauma Department should only treat serious and critical emergency cases,” she said in her speech at the Health Ministry’s monthly assembly here on Monday (March 27)

            <p>
                Dr Zaliha said the change in patient arrival patterns from HTAR’s Emergency and Trauma Department to the Bandar Botanik Health Clinic would be monitored during the implementation of the pilot project

The meal would cost upwards of £50 at his local Chinese - Wing's in Manchester, where he is a regular, with the Singapore chow mein coming to £20.40 as the most expensive item that he orders.  The Man City star was previously pictured celebrating his side's 6-3 victory over rivals Manchester United with a Chinese, but his order was unclear until now.  Grealish tucked into a Chinese earlier in the season after Man City thrashed Man United Wing's is Grealish's preferred Chinese of choice, just minutes away from his Manchester home He also previously revealed to Sportsmail that he feasted on 16 scoops ice cream during his time in New York City, admitting that he felt the effects when returning to Manchester

                Then, in the 70th minute, he (Pep Guardiola) says, “Jack, you’re going on!” I was like, “f***ing hell!” I was blowing out of my a**e!’  As long as Grealish is performing on the pitch, Guardiola and Gareth Southgate can look past his post-match Chinese treat as his regular visits to Wing's will no doubt continue

                'I have Singapore chow mein, I have egged fried rice, I have salt and pepper chips, I have salt and pepper prawns and then curry sauce.  'Then I just mix it all in and have a big free for all.' The meal would cost upwards of £50 at his local Chinese - Wing's in Manchester, where he is a regular, with the Singapore chow mein coming to £20.40 as the most expensive item that he orders.  The Man City star was previously pictured celebrating his side's 6-3 victory over rivals Manchester United with a Chinese, but his order was unclear until now.  Grealish tucked into a Chinese earlier in the season after Man City thrashed Man United Wing's is Grealish's preferred Chinese of choice, just minutes away from his Manchester home He also previously revealed to Sportsmail that he feasted on 16 scoops ice cream during his time in New York City, admitting that he felt the effects when returning to Manchester

                Then, in the 70th minute, he (Pep Guardiola) says, “Jack, you’re going on!” I was like, “f***ing hell!” I was blowing out of my a**e!’  As long as Grealish is performing on the pitch, Guardiola and Gareth Southgate can look past his post-match Chinese treat as his regular visits to Wing's will no doubt continue

                Antonio Conte's reign at Tottenham unravelled very quickly after a promising start Conte launched a furious tirade at his own players after Spurs drew 3-3 at Southampton Conte has now headed for the exit door at Tottenham and those who said it would never last were right again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then came Conte's own health scare
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was an ambitious appointment from Daniel Levy, but has ended up being a waste of time Conte has had to deal with one setback after another on and off the pitch at Tottenham By the time he returned for the second time, for the second leg of the Milan tie, it was becoming increasingly likely he would be leaving Spurs when his contract expired in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Conte's gamble to rest players in ties he expected to win backfired
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tottenham's 3-3 draw at Southampton was the last straw for Conte as he hit out at his players Conte leaves the club no better off than they were under former boss Jose Mourinho Richarlison has suffered one injury after another and grumbled about Conte's selection after the Champions League exit at the hands of Milan and Bissouma having failed to break into the team is injured and expected to miss the rest of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Conte's exit leaves Tottenham no further forward than they were when they hired and fired Mourinho

                Antonio Conte's reign at Tottenham unravelled very quickly after a promising start Conte launched a furious tirade at his own players after Spurs drew 3-3 at Southampton Conte has now headed for the exit door at Tottenham and those who said it would never last were right again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then came Conte's own health scare
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was an ambitious appointment from Daniel Levy, but has ended up being a waste of time Conte has had to deal with one setback after another on and off the pitch at Tottenham By the time he returned for the second time, for the second leg of the Milan tie, it was becoming increasingly likely he would be leaving Spurs when his contract expired in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Conte's gamble to rest players in ties he expected to win backfired
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tottenham's 3-3 draw at Southampton was the last straw for Conte as he hit out at his players Conte leaves the club no better off than they were under former boss Jose Mourinho Richarlison has suffered one injury after another and grumbled about Conte's selection after the Champions League exit at the hands of Milan and Bissouma having failed to break into the team is injured and expected to miss the rest of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Conte's exit leaves Tottenham no further forward than they were when they hired and fired Mourinho
            </p>

                About Us Advertise   BUKIT MERTAJAM, March 26 — The Education Ministry (MoE) has received information that two of the three siblings, believed to be victims of abuse in an incident in Perlis, have been attending school in the state

            <p>

                IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva reiterated her view that 2023 would be another challenging year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Uncertainties are exceptionally high," with the outlook for the global economy likely to remain weak over the medium term, she told the China Development Forum

            <p>
                The IMF chief, however, pointed to China's rebound as a bright spot for the world economy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The IMF forecasts China's economy to grow 5.2 percent this year, driven by a rebound in private consumption as the country reopens after its pandemic isolation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The robust rebound means China is set to account for around one third of global growth in 2023 -- giving a welcome lift to the world economy," she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "A 1.0 percentage point increase in GDP growth in China leads to 0.3 percentage point increase in growth in other Asian economies, on average -- a welcome boost." Georgieva urged China's policymakers to seek to raise productivity and rebalance the economy away from investment and towards more durable consumption-driven growth

            <p>
                In a brief statement late on Saturday, the Honduran foreign ministry said it recognised the People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate government that represents all of China and that Taiwan is an “inseparable part of Chinese territory”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taipei strongly rejects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, in a video statement, said Taiwan will not compete with China in “meaningless” dollar diplomacy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “China seems to be doing this intentionally,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Relations between Honduras and Taiwan date back to 1941 when the government of the Republic of China, which remains Taiwan’s official name, was still in China before it fled to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong’s communists

                But US politicians did not offer any support for TikTok and they called Chew’s answers on China “evasive”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why is TikTok under fire As the app is owned by China-based parent company ByteDance, US politicians are concerned that TikTok user data could end up in the hands of the Chinese government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chew had said repeatedly that TikTok has 150 million monthly active users in the United States
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s next for TikTok? Following Chew’s appearance before Congress, the future of TikTok in the US remains uncertain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moreover, Tiktok users, who tend to be younger, will not be happy with any such ban
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, he confirmed that ByteDance engineers in China still have access to TikTok data

                But US politicians did not offer any support for TikTok and they called Chew’s answers on China “evasive”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why is TikTok under fire As the app is owned by China-based parent company ByteDance, US politicians are concerned that TikTok user data could end up in the hands of the Chinese government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chew had said repeatedly that TikTok has 150 million monthly active users in the United States
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s next for TikTok? Following Chew’s appearance before Congress, the future of TikTok in the US remains uncertain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moreover, Tiktok users, who tend to be younger, will not be happy with any such ban
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, he confirmed that ByteDance engineers in China still have access to TikTok data
