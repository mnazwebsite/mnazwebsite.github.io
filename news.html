                How Are Capital Gains Taxed? The IRS taxes short-term capital gains as standard income, meaning your income tax bracket will determine your tax rate

            <p>
                Your income determines your capital gains tax rates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sale results in a short-term capital gain, and your income is $115,000 when you file taxes
            </p>

                Money is one of them

            <p>
                So here’s a look at three ways to save money on car ownership — no matter what you drive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if you drive an ICE vehicle, you can monitor gas prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If your car is electric, there are ways to save on charging, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No matter what type of vehicle you drive, if you think you are paying too much for your car insurance policy, you might want to compare car insurance and save up to $500 a year

                Ismail Sabri told Star Media Group’s Malay-language news portal Majoriti that his openness to speak out is a necessity to ensure the party would continue progressing as an open and diverse platform for all its members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If everyone does not want to talk, ideas in the party cannot be shared

            <p>
                After all, party president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had previously said that he celebrates differences of opinion with the party," said Ismail Sabri
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If he believes its wrong, he doesn’t have to take it but if its positive for the party, he can choose to take it,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Ismail Sabri was speculated to have been suspended for questioning the Umno supreme council’s decision to fire and suspend several Umno leaders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri then acknowledged that his outspokenness against recent actions in Umno would likely lead to disciplinary action taken against him and that he would be prepared to accept any punishment

                Ismail Sabri told Star Media Group’s Malay-language news portal Majoriti that his openness to speak out is a necessity to ensure the party would continue progressing as an open and diverse platform for all its members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If everyone does not want to talk, ideas in the party cannot be shared
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, party president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had previously said that he celebrates differences of opinion with the party," said Ismail Sabri
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If he believes its wrong, he doesn’t have to take it but if its positive for the party, he can choose to take it,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Ismail Sabri was speculated to have been suspended for questioning the Umno supreme council’s decision to fire and suspend several Umno leaders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri then acknowledged that his outspokenness against recent actions in Umno would likely lead to disciplinary action taken against him and that he would be prepared to accept any punishment

            </p>
            
            <p>
                With forecasting how much dividend income you can safely expect, historical numbers provide a reliable barometer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Close the gap with whatever retirement income you already have and if the number is lower than that $100,000 — say, just $10,000 — you’ll be in better shape to experience dividend-derived freedom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since 2018, the fund’s median dividend yield has been 2.97%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That means you’d need just $3,367,003 to generate $100,000 in passive income annually

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 4 — The federal government should maintain if not increase its spending on public healthcare when it retables Budget 2023 in Parliament in the next few weeks, the Galen Centre for Health and Social Policy said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its CEO Azrul Mohd Khalib warned that any cuts to public healthcare would lead to a collapse of the entire system that has been buckling under the strain of the Covid-19 pandemic the last few years even as he expressed alarm at the recent news reports of burnout among the country’s shrinking medical workforce
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azrul’s warning comes ahead of the Anwar administration’s plan to retable a revision to the Budget in Parliament on February 24, to reflect the country’s national debt and liabilities currently amounting to RM1.5 trillion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Budget 2023 had been tabled last October by the previous government then led by Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob but was not debated on or passed, due to the dissolution of Parliament that paved the way for the 15th general election last November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Several ministers have been reported expecting a leaner Budget with the global economic headwinds this year post pandemic
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 4 — The federal government should maintain if not increase its spending on public healthcare when it retables Budget 2023 in Parliament in the next few weeks, the Galen Centre for Health and Social Policy said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its CEO Azrul Mohd Khalib warned that any cuts to public healthcare would lead to a collapse of the entire system that has been buckling under the strain of the Covid-19 pandemic the last few years even as he expressed alarm at the recent news reports of burnout among the country’s shrinking medical workforce
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azrul’s warning comes ahead of the Anwar administration’s plan to retable a revision to the Budget in Parliament on February 24, to reflect the country’s national debt and liabilities currently amounting to RM1.5 trillion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Budget 2023 had been tabled last October by the previous government then led by Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob but was not debated on or passed, due to the dissolution of Parliament that paved the way for the 15th general election last November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Several ministers have been reported expecting a leaner Budget with the global economic headwinds this year post pandemic

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 4 — A DAP federal lawmaker today called on the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and the Election Commission (EC) to investigate Bersatu’s partners in the Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition for possible fund abuses during last year’s contentious general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kampar MP Chong Zhemin said that since the anti-graft watchdog had frozen Bersatu’s bank accounts, it should also look into the accounts of both PAS and Gerakan to check the source of its campaign funds for GE15 last November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Where did Perikatan Nasional receive such a huge amount of money to use in the election campaign?” Chong asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He cited Article 19(1)(a) of the Election Offences Act 1954 which restricts the spending of each election candidate to RM200,000 maximum for parliamentary seats, and RM100,000 for state seats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I urge the Election Commission (EC) to also investigate whether the expenditures of PN candidates in the general election have exceeded the legal limit,” added Chong who is also Perak DAP publicity secretary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Wedneday, MACC confirmed that it had suspended Bersatu’s bank accounts to facilitate investigations under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 that began last December

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 4 — A DAP federal lawmaker today called on the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and the Election Commission (EC) to investigate Bersatu’s partners in the Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition for possible fund abuses during last year’s contentious general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kampar MP Chong Zhemin said that since the anti-graft watchdog had frozen Bersatu’s bank accounts, it should also look into the accounts of both PAS and Gerakan to check the source of its campaign funds for GE15 last November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Where did Perikatan Nasional receive such a huge amount of money to use in the election campaign?” Chong asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He cited Article 19(1)(a) of the Election Offences Act 1954 which restricts the spending of each election candidate to RM200,000 maximum for parliamentary seats, and RM100,000 for state seats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I urge the Election Commission (EC) to also investigate whether the expenditures of PN candidates in the general election have exceeded the legal limit,” added Chong who is also Perak DAP publicity secretary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Wedneday, MACC confirmed that it had suspended Bersatu’s bank accounts to facilitate investigations under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 that began last December

                Is everything finally fine at Intel, or will we have opportunities to buy Intel below $25, or lower, perhaps? The bear market bottom for Intel's stock is approximately $24 thus far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Intel was about $65 at its peak in 2021, and despite the recent 25% rebound, Intel remains a long way from its highs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have a decade of almost no gains in Intel's stock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This phenomenon should create several problems for Intel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This dynamic could contribute to the next round of selling in Intel's stock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Intel appears remarkably overvalued at $30 here

                Is everything finally fine at Intel, or will we have opportunities to buy Intel below $25, or lower, perhaps? The bear market bottom for Intel's stock is approximately $24 thus far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Intel was about $65 at its peak in 2021, and despite the recent 25% rebound, Intel remains a long way from its highs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have a decade of almost no gains in Intel's stock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This phenomenon should create several problems for Intel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This dynamic could contribute to the next round of selling in Intel's stock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Intel appears remarkably overvalued at $30 here

                With the price of RM5, I can buy two to three packets for me and my children for lunch,” said Suhaila, adding that she was grateful for the government’s move to introduce the Menu Rahmah initiative

                Meanwhile, Mohd Ezayddy Mohd Sofian, 41, operator of the Nasi Ayam Viral Klebang Putra restaurant, in Chemor, also responded to the government’s call to prepare the Menu Rahmah Menu, as his own initiative to share the sustenance with the less fortunate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since I have a large family, I can buy in large quantities

            <p>
                Usually, the price of chicken rice in the market is around RM7 to RM10, so the price of this Menu Rahmah is affordable
            </p>

                With the price of RM5, I can buy two to three packets for me and my children for lunch,” said Suhaila, adding that she was grateful for the government’s move to introduce the Menu Rahmah initiative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We don’t prepare the side dishes in large quantities, because we want to maintain the quality of the food and avoid waste
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Mohd Ezayddy Mohd Sofian, 41, operator of the Nasi Ayam Viral Klebang Putra restaurant, in Chemor, also responded to the government’s call to prepare the Menu Rahmah Menu, as his own initiative to share the sustenance with the less fortunate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since I have a large family, I can buy in large quantities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Usually, the price of chicken rice in the market is around RM7 to RM10, so the price of this Menu Rahmah is affordable

                In those BBM messages in December 2014, she explained to Low that this was because Cheah Tek Kuang was leaving AmBank’s board by the end of the month and the bank would not have any direct access to the account holder Najib, and that Cheah’s replacement Ashok Ramamurthy would be updating Bank Negara Malaysia, AmBank’s chief risk officer and AmBank’s board about Najib’s accounts

                Chow said the JPV has sent the application of reparations to Putrajaya for 10 pig farms that have completed its culling process

            <p>

                He advised pig farmers and the public to immediately report any death relating to wild boars, village pigs or commercial pigs to the Penang JPV via the Disease Crisis Management Room hotline at 04-5041047.

                "So far, the ASF positive farms were at South Seberang Prai (18), Central Seberang Prai (2), North Seberang Prai (4) and the south-west district (3)," he said during a press conference at Komtar on Friday (Feb 3)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chow said the JPV has sent the application of reparations to Putrajaya for 10 pig farms that have completed its culling process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He called on the public to remain calm as the ASF is not zoonotic and only infected pigs and wild boar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He advised pig farmers and the public to immediately report any death relating to wild boars, village pigs or commercial pigs to the Penang JPV via the Disease Crisis Management Room hotline at 04-5041047.

                This will be similar to the system that will be used when the Rapid Transit System (RTS) operations begin in 2026.” The RTS link aims to connect the Bukit Chagar in Johor Bahru city to Woodlands in Singapore, serving about 10,000 passengers per hour each way to help ease traffic congestion on the Causeway.  CNA has reached out to Singapore's Immigration and Checkpoints Authority for further comments on the proposal laid out by Mr Fazli.  According to him, Johor was also looking for additional funding to increase motorcycle lanes from 50 to 75 each way at the Causeway.  Mr Fazli, who heads a multi-agency task force that looks into easing congestion at the Causeway and Second Link in Tuas, reportedly told The Star that there was a proposal for the lorry lanes to be used for passenger traffic on the weekends.  The Star reported that Johor chief minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi had previously appealed for something to be done about the situation at the Causeway, saying that about 150,000 regular commuters were being greatly inconvenienced by the heavy traffic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that a majority of commuters entering Singapore had to wake up at 4am to queue at the Johor Bahru border checkpoint by 5am in order to get through the traffic gridlock for work and return late at night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In December last year, Mr Onn Hafiz announced several measures aimed at reducing the congestion at Johor Bahru’s Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) complex during the tabling of the 2023 Johor state budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among the measures that Mr Onn Hafiz said will be implemented include the restructuring of lanes for motorcycles and cars entering as well as exiting Johor.  Last month, Malaysia's home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail announced that Singaporeans entering Johor via the two land checkpoints can now use electronic gate (e-gate) facilities which would benefit between 30,000 and 50,000 Singaporeans who visit Johor Bahru for social purposes

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 3 — Following an expected growth of 7.8 per cent in 2022, Malaysia’s economy is projected to grow at a “moderate pace” of 4.0 per cent this year, according to the World Bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its “Malaysia Economic Monitor February 2023” report released today, the World Bank attributed the lower growth rate partly to a troubled global economy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The World Bank previously announced that global economic growth is forecasted to decelerate sharply to 1.7 per cent in 2023, compared to a 2022 global growth rate of 2.8 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report also said that in line with a less supportive global environment, Malaysia’s trade growth is expected to slow down to 2.2 per cent in 2023, while import growth is projected to drop to 2.1 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, it said that government revenue is projected to decrease to 15 per cent of GDP this year — compared to the expected 16.7 per cent in 2022 — as crude oil prices come down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The main factor that is expected to drive Malaysia’s economic growth this year is domestic private spending

                Members of the Alphabet Workers Union (CWA) hold a rally outside the Google office in response to recent layoffs, in New York on Feb 2, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google’s parent company Alphabet announced in January it will cut about 12,000 jobs globally, citing a changing economic reality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rallies, one held on Feb 1 at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, and another on Feb 2 near Google’s corporate offices in New York City, came after the company announced the largest reduction in its history – 12,000 positions, or 6% of its global workforce
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The protest in New York, which drew about 50 employees outside a Google store on Ninth Avenue, began just minutes after parent company Alphabet Inc reported fourth-quarter results, including US$13.6 billion in profit

                Premier League • England Man Utd intend to go back in for a Real Madrid star they already bid for last summer, though convincing Carlo Ancelotti to sanction a sale won’t be easy – even amid talk of an €80m bid, per a report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to reports in Spain, (via the Manchester Evening News) a move for Real Madrid’s Federico Valverde was explored too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, per the report, he has a strong admirer in the form of Man Utd who it’s claimed failed with a bid last summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the unlikely event Man Utd were able to pull off the blockbuster coup, logic would dictate Marcel Sabitzer would stand no chance of earning a permanent move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Sabitzer believes he can earn a permanent move to United this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A positive impression could mean he might secure a permanent summer switch.” However, Ten Hag deploys just a two-man midfield and in the event Valverde were signed, Sabitzer would be fourth-choice at absolute best behind Casemiro, Eriksen and Valverde

                Premier League • England Man Utd intend to go back in for a Real Madrid star they already bid for last summer, though convincing Carlo Ancelotti to sanction a sale won’t be easy – even amid talk of an €80m bid, per a report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to reports in Spain, (via the Manchester Evening News) a move for Real Madrid’s Federico Valverde was explored too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, per the report, he has a strong admirer in the form of Man Utd who it’s claimed failed with a bid last summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the unlikely event Man Utd were able to pull off the blockbuster coup, logic would dictate Marcel Sabitzer would stand no chance of earning a permanent move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Sabitzer believes he can earn a permanent move to United this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A positive impression could mean he might secure a permanent summer switch.” However, Ten Hag deploys just a two-man midfield and in the event Valverde were signed, Sabitzer would be fourth-choice at absolute best behind Casemiro, Eriksen and Valverde

                Gets 8.5, Asensio With 8 | Real Madrid Players Rated In Impressive Victory Vs Valencia Benrahma To Start, Fornals On The Bench | 3-4-2-1 West Ham United Predicted Lineup Vs Newcastle United Watkins And Buendia Lead The Line Up Top | 4-4-2 Aston Villa Predicted XI Vs Leicester City According to a report from Express, it was stated that Liverpool could still complete a few deals despite having a quiet January transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is mentioned that the Reds could target Thomas Lemar of Atletico Madrid who will be out of contract at the end of this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is understood that the French midfielder isn’t keen on extending his contract with the Spanish outfit as they look to cut wage bills from the next term, and this could mean that the Merseyside club could land him for free in the summer transfer window if they agree to his wage demands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is even more prevalent now as the Reds languish in the ninth position of the Premier League table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The French sensation could be a shrewd acquisition for Liverpool if they agree to his wage demands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So Jurgen Klopp would be wise to finalise terms with the Atletico midfielder before other clubs start targeting him ahead of the summer transfer window

                Gets 8.5, Asensio With 8 | Real Madrid Players Rated In Impressive Victory Vs Valencia Benrahma To Start, Fornals On The Bench | 3-4-2-1 West Ham United Predicted Lineup Vs Newcastle United Watkins And Buendia Lead The Line Up Top | 4-4-2 Aston Villa Predicted XI Vs Leicester City According to a report from Express, it was stated that Liverpool could still complete a few deals despite having a quiet January transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is mentioned that the Reds could target Thomas Lemar of Atletico Madrid who will be out of contract at the end of this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is understood that the French midfielder isn’t keen on extending his contract with the Spanish outfit as they look to cut wage bills from the next term, and this could mean that the Merseyside club could land him for free in the summer transfer window if they agree to his wage demands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is even more prevalent now as the Reds languish in the ninth position of the Premier League table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The French sensation could be a shrewd acquisition for Liverpool if they agree to his wage demands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So Jurgen Klopp would be wise to finalise terms with the Atletico midfielder before other clubs start targeting him ahead of the summer transfer window

            <p>
                Bersih said Perikatan’s decision to create a shadow Cabinet is a move forward to empower the Dewan Rakyat and democracy in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that the shadow Cabinet members should also be given allocation for a paid researcher with qualifications related to the portfolio of the shadow minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bersih also said that the shadow Cabinet should also be given access to suitable government information for the formation of realistic policies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Improve the schedule and order of business in the Dewan Rakyat through negotiations with the Opposition chief and representatives of the shadow Cabinet,” it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Feb 2, Perikatan unveiled its shadow Cabinet and its chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin will be leading the line-up as the chief of its MP.

                Aizat Fikri Nasir, who lodged a report with the ROS over the no-contest motion, disputed Ahmad Maslan's earlier statement, saying that he received a letter from the department dated Jan 26 stating that it was still in the midst of checking and investigating his complaint
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Ahmad Maslan said the passing of a no-contest motion for the president and deputy president posts during the recent 2022 Umno General Assembly did not breach the party's constitution or rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 31, senior Umno representatives met and provided an explanation to the Registrar of Societies (RoS) regarding the passing of the motion

            <p>
                In his complaint, Aizat alleged that the no-contest resolution was invalid and contravened the party constitution

            <p>
                Terengganu Umno liaison chief Datuk Seri Ahmad Said had distanced himself from Aizat's complaint, saying the latter had acted on his own.

                Emilia Hanafi, 43, said that she chose to work part-time because she had to manage the schooling of her three sons, aged 17, 12 and 10, including dropping them off and fetching them from school

            <p>
                Thursday’s hearing was supposed to proceed with the sixth prosecution witness, Elisa Nani, who is Emilia's younger sister, to be cross-examined by the lawyer, but Akberdin applied for Emilia be called to testify first, because she is an important witness for the prosecution

                Joanna Yu, who is the 41st prosecution witness in the RM2.28bil 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) graft trial involving Najib, has consistently told the High Court that she dealt with Low, or better known as Jho Low, to get instructions on Najib's accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low's denial was brought up by Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah here at the High Court on Thursday (Feb 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defence has previously contended that Low was the "mastermind" behind the 1MDB scandal while Yu testified before that she would receive instructions from Low on managing Najib's bank account whenever she could not get hold of Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, who is the mandate holder to Najib's bank accounts
            </p>

                The witness also said she had rejected job offers from Low several times because she did not want to work according to Low's lifestyle

                In the statement of claim, Mohd Hatta said Dr Mahathir, who was then the seventh prime minister, had committed tort misfeasance in public office when he decided to postpone the HSR project, causing the government and the Malaysian people to pay compensation of almost RM46 million to the Singapore government

                He claimed that Muhyiddin, who was then the eighth prime minister, also committed tort misfeasance in public office for terminating the project, causing the Malaysian government and the people to pay RM320,270,519.24 as compensation for the cancellation of the Bilateral Agreement between Malaysia and Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Hatta claimed that Mustapha, who was responsible for managing the project, had committed a similar offence by shelving the project, while Wee committed tort misfeasance in public office for denying the Malaysians their right to enjoy a first-class transport system with the cancellation of the HSR project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is seeking a court order to declare the cancellation of the project null and void, as well as for all the defendants to pay RM1 million compensation to him and all Malaysians for wrongfully and negligently cancelling the HSR project

            <p>
                On January 1, 2021, Malaysia and Singapore announced the termination of the 350-kilometre HSR project as the two countries failed to reach an agreement on changes proposed by Malaysia before the expiry of the project agreement on December 31, 2020

            <p>

                Describing it as another significant victory for Malaysia against the self-claimed heirs, Azalina said the Spanish Court's annulment of Stampa’s appointment as arbitrator is final and reaffirms Malaysia’s position on the arbitration case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On June 29, 2021, the High Court of Justice of Madrid (HCJM) issued a decision that annulled the judicial appointment of Stampa to act as an arbitrator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stampa was initially appointed arbitrator in 2019 by the HCJM without Malaysia being involved in the case

                This constitutional appeal did not say the effects of the annulment decision and as such, his Stampa's termination was already final and binding since a court decision on June 29, 2021, Azalina said

            <p>
                Azalina said that the Spanish Constitutional Court had rejected the constitutional appeal filed by the Sulu claimants because they had withdrawn their claim to appoint an arbitrator following the annulment decision

                Sabitzer, 28, had become frustrated at a shortage of game time at Bayern since Julian Nagelsmann, his coach at Leipzig, took him to the Allianz Arena with him in the summer of 2021

                Sabitzer is welcomed to Bayern in the traditional manner after joining the club in August 2021 Sabitzer was a Bayern fan as a kid and once failed miserably in a trial there when he was 14 But Sabitzer's (left) time at Bayern had seen game time severely restricted in big games Ralf Rangnick, well known to United fans, was director of football for both Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg when he identified Sabitzer as a promising player at Rapid Vienna and signed him to the German club in 2014

                Determining How Much You Have You may think that you have $1.5 million for retirement, but a closer inspection of your assets and income streams may make you realize you have more

                Taking a thorough inventory can help you determine not only how long $1.5 million will last, but how much you can reasonably spend each year.  Retirement Assets  In addition to your $1.5 million, you may have other assets that can be used to supplement your income at a later date or will be included in your estate for your heirs

                Retire early? As the old saying goes, that’s good work if you can get it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why is that plan, in the words of economist Laurence Kotlikoff, “one of the worst money mistakes” you can make? For starters, the market has since retreated, erasing many of the pandemic’s gains and waking many from their early-retirement dreams

                “We are, as a group, lousy savers, making early retirement unaffordable,” Kotlikoff wrote in a guest column for CNBC last year

            <p>
                Unexpected health expenses — never mind long-term care — are significant drains on retirement funds

                But Social Security is currently on a timer

            <p>
                Economists have long warned against overly relying on Social Security, and many of them urge investors to build retirement plans that assume the program will be gone

                Retire early? As the old saying goes, that’s good work if you can get it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why is that plan, in the words of economist Laurence Kotlikoff, “one of the worst money mistakes” you can make? For starters, the market has since retreated, erasing many of the pandemic’s gains and waking many from their early-retirement dreams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are, as a group, lousy savers, making early retirement unaffordable,” Kotlikoff wrote in a guest column for CNBC last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unexpected health expenses — never mind long-term care — are significant drains on retirement funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Social Security is currently on a timer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Economists have long warned against overly relying on Social Security, and many of them urge investors to build retirement plans that assume the program will be gone

            <p>
                Anwar said Malaysia also calls upon the international community to hold the Israeli regime to account for these crimes and demands the regime to immediately cease further acts of cruelty and barbarism

                He also said that Malaysia continues to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine, and reaffirms its unwavering support for the Palestinians and their cause to achieve freedom from the illegal Israeli occupation and realise their aspirations for an independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as their capital

                "Malaysia calls on all right-minded world leaders to categorically denounce the outright killings of the Palestinians committed by the authorities of Israel," he said on Thursday (Feb 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said Malaysia also calls upon the international community to hold the Israeli regime to account for these crimes and demands the regime to immediately cease further acts of cruelty and barbarism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said that Malaysia continues to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine, and reaffirms its unwavering support for the Palestinians and their cause to achieve freedom from the illegal Israeli occupation and realise their aspirations for an independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as their capital

                The court also rejected Hock Peng’s application to strike out the suit filed by the government through the LHDN

            <p>
                On March 24, 2021, the government as the plaintiff filed an application for a summary judgment to be entered against Hock Peng as the defendant in its suit to recover RM1,884,098,662.55 with interest at 5% per annum from the date of this judgment (Feb 1) to the date of full realisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The application was made on the grounds, among others, that the tax arrears and tax increases imposed under the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1967 can be recovered as a tax due and payable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hock Peng filed an application to strike out the suit on March 22, 2021, saying, among others, that the assessment years 2011 and 2012, as well as the additional assessments for 2013 and 2014, were invalid because they were made more than five years from the year of assessment on the income claimed to have accrued without complying with Section 91(3) of the Income Tax Act 1967

                On Oct 18 last year, the Penang High Court allowed LHDN’s application for a summary judgment to recover RM1.05bil in tax arrears from Jho Low

                “The government has just received official confirmation that the constitutional appeal filed by the Claimants has been rejected and that, as a result, the annulment of Stampa’s appointment (which was already final and binding) has also been confirmed by the Spanish Constitutional Court

                In explaining today’s decision, Azalina said on June 29, 2021, the High Court of Justice of Madrid (HJCM) issued a decision that annulled the unlawful judicial appointment of Stampa to act as an arbitrator (“Annulment Decision”)

                Arsenal moved on January transfer deadline day to snap up Jorginho from Chelsea for £12million - but the Italian was not the only midfielder on the Gunners' radar  Arsenal explored the possibility of signing two eye-catching midfielders who ply their trade on the continent before wrapping up a deal for Jorginho, according to reports

                The Gunners moved to address their lack of options in the centre of the park by signing Jorginho from Chelsea on a short-term contract in a transfer worth £12million

            <p>
                Jorginho was the player welcomed to London Colney training ground on Tuesday, but he was far from the only player on the club's radar as the window wound down

                Members of the Incident Management Team coordinate the search for a radioactive capsule that was lost in transit by a contractor hired by Rio Tinto, at the Emergency Services Complex in Cockburn, Australia, in this undated handout photo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Caesium-137 capsule lost in transit more than two weeks ago was discovered when a vehicle travelling at 70 kms per hour equipped with specialist detection equipment picked up the radiation, according to officials from the state of Western Australia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The search team then used portable detection equipment to find the capsule, which was located about 2 metres from the side of the road in a remote area far from any community, they added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The radioactive capsule was part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed from Rio Tinto's  Gudai-Darri mine in the state's remote Kimberley region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                People had been told to stay at least five metres (16.5 feet) away if they spotted the capsule, because exposure could cause radiation burns or radiation sickness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Western Australia's Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said the find was an "extraordinary result" after a search involving the state's emergency response department, defence authorities and radiation specialists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Western Australia's Chief Health Officer Andrew Robertson said there would be an investigation and prosecutions would be considered under state radiation safety laws from 1975

                There are three spots up for grabs.  The top two posts in UMNO – that of the president and deputy president – will not be contested after its General Assembly passed a motion in January to leave those posts unchallenged at the upcoming internal election

                Mr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is the party president while Mr Mohamad Hasan is the deputy president.  According to a report by the New Straits Times (NST) on Wednesday (Feb 1), at least seven candidates will be contesting for the three vice-president spots.  They include the party’s Supreme Council members Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir, Ms Azalina Othman Said as well as Mr Johari Abdul Ghani

                Dr Zambry is the current foreign affairs minister while Ms Azalina is the current minister of law and institutional reform.  Others who are believed to be interested in the vice-president posts are incumbent Mr Mohamed Khaled Nordin, UMNO youth chief Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki, former Johor chief minister Hasni Mohammad and Sabah UMNO leader Bung Moktar Radin.  The report by NST added that the other two vice-president incumbents - former prime minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Mr Mahdzir Khalid - have not expressed intentions to defend their posts.  Party insiders told NST that incumbent Mr Khaled is likely to retain his post.  “Khaled is expected to defend his post successfully, given his good ties with party leaders and supporters,” the source reportedly said.  NST also reported that the three candidates who have positioned themselves in the “pro-president” camp - Dr Zambry, Ms Azalina and Mr Asyraf - are strong contenders for the three vice-president spots.  “Zambry, Azalina and Asyraf are the only known pro-president candidates in the party,” the source reportedly told NST, adding that Mr Johari is a “wildcard” in the battle to be one of UMNO’s three vice-presidents.  “Johari is close to the party president

                "He has told his supporters that change (for the better) will happen in UMNO and he is preparing for it," the source was quoted as saying by NST.  The NST report also said that a party insider it interviewed denied rumours that former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin and former defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein had planned to contest the vice-president posts.  “That is not true

            <p>
                This comes after UMNO president Ahmad Zahid previously warned that the party would undergo “mass cleansing” to get rid of “saboteurs”.  Separately, international trade and industry minister Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz also announced his intention for a spot on the UMNO Supreme Council at the upcoming party elections.  "I humbly offer myself to contest for a seat in the UMNO Supreme Council with the hopes that I (can) contribute further to the development of the party," he told local broadcaster Astro Awani.  Mr Zafrul added that UMNO members want to see a more dynamic group leading the party

                Delivery driver after delivery driver showed up last night dropping off food at my doorstep, Stonehouse said in a Facebook post
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It started on Saturday, Jan 28, when Keith Stonehouse let his son Mason play with his phone before bed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That would set Stonehouse back hundreds of dollars, as Mason used his father’s Grubhub account to order from various restaurants
            </p>

                New home prices rose month-on-month in 12 cities, up from 10 in December, according to the survey by China Index Academy (CIA), one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms

                China's property sector, accounting for a quarter of the economy, has struggled with defaults and stalled projects, hitting market confidence and weighing on economic growth

                The survey also showed six cities, notably the Chinese capital Beijing and the populous city of Chengdu in southwest China, reversed declines to post growth

            <p>
                More broadly, prices in 100 cities monitored by the research firm fell 0.02 per cent from a month earlier in January compared with the bigger 0.08 per cent drop in December and marking the fourth straight month of narrowing declines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China's financial and commercial hub Shanghai saw a 0.04 per cent rise in home prices in January from a month earlier, extending the 0.01 per cent rise in December, while the mega-city of Hangzhou, capital of the prosperous coastal province of Zhejiang, reported a 0.11 per cent gain versus 0.06 per cent growth in the previous month

                "National property market policies will continue to ease, with some key first- and second-tier cities taking the lead in recovery and driving a gradual stabilisation of the national market," Cao said.

                Julien Laurens explains why Premier League record breaking signing of Enzo Fernandez by Chelsea is a 'game changer'
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A statement from Benfica confirmed that a deal had been reached between the clubs over how Chelsea would pay the release fee for the 22-year-old, who has signed an eight-and-a-half year contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal breaks the previous Premier League record fee of £100m that Manchester City paid for Jack Grealish when he joined from Aston Villa in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Benfica boss Roger Schmidt was not keen on seeing Fernandez leave, but had previously said their hands would be tied if a club paid the player's release clause
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal takes Chelsea's total outlay on players since last year's takeover by an investment group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital to more than £500m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea are 10th in the Premier League, 10 points adrift of a top-four spot

                THERE might not be any authentic Geordies in the Newcastle team once the Saudi money starts truly gushing into Tyneside.   So this was a night to cherish for the Toon Army, and for local hero Sean Longstaff, as his early double in front of the Gallowgate End propelled the club to its first Wembley final in 24 years.  The big midfielder, Newcastle born and bred, was serenaded with cries of "he’s one of our own" from a home crowd who thought they might be able to enjoy a significant win without much anxiety or tension

                Now, in the Carabao Cup Final, they will face Manchester United - barring a miracle from Nottingham Forest in the second leg at Old Trafford - seeking a first major trophy in 54 years and a first Wembley final success in 68 years

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 1 — TikTok star Callum Ryan set himself up for his coolest challenge yet — to fly to Italy and buy a pizza for cheaper than the price of a UK Domino’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Upon arrival in Milan, he used TikTok to find the best place for pizza and headed straight there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As soon as he was seated, he was served a free glass of prosecco and a piece of what he described as a pizza pesto thing that he concluded was, “Quite nice.” He then ordered a Margherita pizza and also a beer which didn’t count as it was an optional extra
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After finishing the pizza that he said looked beautiful, it was time to pay for the bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pizza on its own was €8.50 and the table service was €2.50, which meant a total of €11, which converted into £9.72 (RM52)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adding to that the price of the £8 flight ticket, it means he paid just £17.72 (RM 94) — cheaper than a UK medium Domino’s pizza which costs £19.99 (RM106)

                As soon as he was seated, he was served a free glass of prosecco and a piece of what he described as a pizza pesto thing that he concluded was, “Quite nice.” He then ordered a Margherita pizza and also a beer which didn’t count as it was an optional extra
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After finishing the pizza that he said looked beautiful, it was time to pay for the bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pizza on its own was €8.50 and the table service was €2.50, which meant a total of €11, which converted into £9.72 (RM52)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adding to that the price of the £8 flight ticket, it means he paid just £17.72 (RM 94) — cheaper than a UK medium Domino’s pizza which costs £19.99 (RM106)

                Members of the Incident Management Team coordinate the search for a radioactive capsule that was lost in transit by a contractor hired by Rio Tinto, at the Emergency Services Complex in Cockburn, Australia, in this undated handout photo

            <p>
                The Caesium-137 capsule lost in transit more than two weeks ago was discovered when a vehicle travelling at 70 km per hour (43 mph) equipped with specialist detection equipment picked up the radiation, according to officials from the state of Western Australia

            <p>
                The search team then used portable detection equipment to find the capsule, which was located about 2 metres from the side of the road in a remote area far from any community, they added

            <p>
                The radioactive capsule was part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed from Rio Tinto's  Gudai-Darri mine in the state's remote Kimberley region

                Defender Matt Doherty has joined Atletico Madrid for the remainder of the season after the Republic of Ireland international's contract with Tottenham Hotspur was terminated on Tuesday, the clubs announced
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Atletico are in the market for a right-back to serve as a backup to Nahuel Molina and have made that their priority ahead of bringing in an experienced centre-back, despite the expected exit of Felipe to Nottingham Forest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following Mario Hermoso's improved performances for Atletico in recent games, Atletico decided against signing centre-back Caglar Soyuncu from Leicester City in this transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, the Atletico will wait until the end of the season when the Turkey international's contract at Leicester expires
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Doherty is Atletico's preferred choice ahead of Roma's Rick Karsdorp, with sources telling ESPN the relationship between Atletico and Spurs allowed for a deal to be reached quickly ahead of the January transfer deadline
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Atletico, meanwhile, are still hoping to find a club for midfielder Saul Niguez, who is a target of Valencia

                About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, Jan 31 — It is “shameful” of the “political bandits” who had recently tried to attempt a coup against Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor to now ask to be part of the new government, said Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) president Datuk Seri Maximus Ongkili
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili, whose PBS is part of the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) ruling coalition, described the three parties — Umno, Parti Warisan and Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Masyarakat (PKDM) — as “power-hungry political bandits” who had created the “disturbance” for their own political gain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Isn’t it a shameful political ploy that after failing to dislodge the chief minister and his government, you suddenly want to be invited to be part of the government?” he asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili, who was the former minister for Sabah and Sarawak affairs, said that he hoped the “cooling off period” called by Umno president and deputy prime minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is welcomed to strengthen political unity and solidarity in the state
            </p>

                "My only appeal is for them to settle this deal with Malaysia because 1MDB is known throughout the world.  "It is there in the books and I think that Goldman Sachs should come out clean and deal with Malaysia,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was previously reported that Goldman claimed that Malaysia had "undervalued" the assets already retrieved, as part of its recovery from the scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under a settlement announced in October 2020, Goldman was to pay US$2.5 billion (RM10.7 billion) while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4 billion of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the world.  According to Bloomberg, the settlement was in exchange for Malaysia to drop charges against Goldman Sachs.  The bank was also to make a one-time interim payment of US$250 million if Malaysia has not received at least US$500 million in assets and proceeds by August 2022.  However, Bloomberg reported that Goldman, in its filing to the United States' Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), had accused Malaysia of having “unilaterally reduced” the value of one asset by US$80 million.  Malaysia was also reportedly declined to include substantial additional assets in accounting of assets and proceeds recovered.  In the Bloomberg interview, Mr Anwar said that Malaysia is supposed to be paid much more than the amount stated in the settlement.  “Given a fair deal, we are supposed to be paid much more than that, which I intend to deal with them, if these things are not settled amicably,” he said in response to Goldman’s claims.  “It’s not my intention – I’m just new in the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How much we can get, I frankly can't say for now, but it's much more than we should be able to do," he said, adding that governments around the world should act more "responsibly" to assist the asset recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to The Star, the Malaysian government in 2018 turned its attention to Goldman Sachs for raising US$6.5 billion in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB.  A huge chunk of the funds - earmarked for development - was, however, diverted to pay bribes to government officials, according to US federal prosecutors.  In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion and the bank also agreed for its Malaysia subsidiary to plead guilty in a US federal court.  Under terms of the deal, Goldman agreed to pay a US$2.3 billion fine for breaking anti-bribery laws and to pay back US$600 million of ill-gotten gains as part of a deferred prosecution agreement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal also requires Goldman to improve its compliance controls.

                Muhammad Mohan, the chairman of the local chapter TI-Malaysia, said despite an increase in the ranking to 61st out of 108 countries compared to 62nd previously, Malaysia’s score continued to fall after reaching its height of 53 points in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Muhammad said among the nine surveys that determine the CPI score, Malaysia had dropped significant points in the 2022 World Economic Forum executive opinion survey from 54 to 47 points, while dropping from 48 to 45 points in the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index Expert Survey for the same period

                He was responding to claims by Goldman that Malaysia had "undervalued" the assets already retrieved, as part of its recovery from the scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Anwar, the 1MDB scandal is a "crime" committed not only against him, or the Malaysian government, but against all "Malaysians." He urged Goldman to "come clean" and settle the deal with Malaysia as 1MDB was a scandal known throughout the world, and not just dismiss it by flexing the firm's financial muscle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goldman raised US$6.5 billion (RM27.6 billion) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion (RM12.3 billion) and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge, to settle probes into the looting of billions of dollars from 1MDB and payment of bribes to win business for the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To a claim by Goldman that Malaysia was intentionally undervaluing the assets to force Goldman to pay a US$250 million interim payment, Anwar said that under a "fair deal", Malaysia was supposed to have been paid much more than that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How much we can get, I frankly can't say for now, but it's much more than we should be able to do (sic)," he said, urging governments around the world to act more "responsibly" to assist the asset recovery.

                Mohd Hatta Sanuri, who filed the suit through Messrs Mohaji, Hazury & Ismail on Dec 30 last year, also named former Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Economy) Mustapa Mohamed, former transport minister Wee Ka Siong and the government as the three other defendants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the statement of claim, Mohd Hatta said Dr Mahathir, who was then prime minister, had committed tort misfeasance in public office when he decided to postpone the HSR project, causing the government and the Malaysian people to pay compensation of almost RM46 million (S$14.2 million) to the Singapore Government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that Muhyiddin also committed tort misfeasance in public office for terminating the project when he was prime minister, causing the Malaysian government and the people to pay RM320.3 million as compensation for the cancellation of the bilateral agreement between Malaysia and Singapore.  Mohd Hatta also claimed that Mustapha, who was responsible for managing the project, had committed a similar offence by shelving the project, while Wee committed tort misfeasance in public office for denying Malaysians their right to enjoy a first-class transport system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Hatta is a member of the Kuala Selangor Municipal Council
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 1, 2021, Malaysia and Singapore announced the termination of the 350km HSR project as the two countries failed to reach an agreement on changes proposed by Malaysia before the expiry of the project agreement on Dec 31, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Accordingly, Malaysia paid S$102.8 million in compensation to Singapore for costs incurred for the development of the HSR project

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the statement of claim, Mohd Hatta said Dr Mahathir, who was then prime minister, had committed tort misfeasance in public office when he decided to postpone the HSR project, causing the government and the Malaysian people to pay compensation of almost RM46 million (S$14.2 million) to the Singapore Government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that Muhyiddin also committed tort misfeasance in public office for terminating the project when he was prime minister, causing the Malaysian government and the people to pay RM320.3 million as compensation for the cancellation of the bilateral agreement between Malaysia and Singapore.  Mohd Hatta also claimed that Mustapha, who was responsible for managing the project, had committed a similar offence by shelving the project, while Wee committed tort misfeasance in public office for denying Malaysians their right to enjoy a first-class transport system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Hatta is a member of the Kuala Selangor Municipal Council

            <p>
                On Jan 1, 2021, Malaysia and Singapore announced the termination of the 350km HSR project as the two countries failed to reach an agreement on changes proposed by Malaysia before the expiry of the project agreement on Dec 31, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Accordingly, Malaysia paid S$102.8 million in compensation to Singapore for costs incurred for the development of the HSR project

                Speaking at the 2021 National Sports Awards ceremony here on Tuesday (Jan 31), Anwar related his discussion with Alex Ferguson during a meeting that was made possible by former United States vice president Al Gore in New York some time ago

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar added that Ferguson's concern in safeguarding the values and welfare of the players should be exemplary and should be replicated by managers and administrators of sports in Malaysia so as to build strong values among athletes
            </p>

                Anwar said success in sports cannot be achieved if the welfare of athletes is ignored

                "We have reached the ceiling and we should gradually go down,” Anwar told Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin in an interview Monday in Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia had raised the debt limit to 60% of gross domestic product from 55% in 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, and lifted it further to 65% in 2021 to make room for additional borrowings to fund fiscal stimulus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s actual debt is at 61% of GDP, and the law under which the ceiling was raised lapsed on Dec 31
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Malaysia remains A-rated by credit agencies Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, a reduction in government debt ratio will be key to winning a higher credit score from Fitch Ratings Ltd, which is currently the only one of the three main rating companies to have a lower BBB+ rating on the South-East Asian nation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, who doubles as Finance Minister, is set to table the revised 2023 Budget to Parliament on Feb 24 and has been preaching fiscal prudence as the South-East Asian nation stares down still-elevated debt levels in the wake of a Covid-era spending drive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While he acknowledged that the goods and services tax remains the most transparent and efficient taxation system, he said his government isn’t in a hurry to reinstate the tax that was abolished in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this month, Anwar had warned that this year’s fiscal position won’t be comfortable, with about RM1.5 trillion in total debt and liabilities and a budget deficit setting around 5.8% of gross domestic product as of last year

                "We have reached the ceiling and we should gradually go down,” Anwar told Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin in an interview Monday in Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia had raised the debt limit to 60% of gross domestic product from 55% in 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, and lifted it further to 65% in 2021 to make room for additional borrowings to fund fiscal stimulus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s actual debt is at 61% of GDP, and the law under which the ceiling was raised lapsed on Dec 31
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Malaysia remains A-rated by credit agencies Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, a reduction in government debt ratio will be key to winning a higher credit score from Fitch Ratings Ltd, which is currently the only one of the three main rating companies to have a lower BBB+ rating on the South-East Asian nation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, who doubles as Finance Minister, is set to table the revised 2023 Budget to Parliament on Feb 24 and has been preaching fiscal prudence as the South-East Asian nation stares down still-elevated debt levels in the wake of a Covid-era spending drive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While he acknowledged that the goods and services tax remains the most transparent and efficient taxation system, he said his government isn’t in a hurry to reinstate the tax that was abolished in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this month, Anwar had warned that this year’s fiscal position won’t be comfortable, with about RM1.5 trillion in total debt and liabilities and a budget deficit setting around 5.8% of gross domestic product as of last year

                Earlier, it was reported that the prosecution team had requested for the 1MDB trial to be deferred for today and tomorrow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib this morning informed the High Court that although today was scheduled for the continued hearing of Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s 1MDB trial, they were asking for a postponement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah then allowed the prosecution’s request and said the trial will resume this Thursday morning with the continued cross-examination of 41st prosecution witness and former AmBank relationship manager Joanna Yu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday afternoon, Sri Ram — who was the lead prosecutor for the 1MDB trial — died at the age of 79 in a private hospital in Kuala Lumpur, following a lung infection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from the 1MDB trial, Sri Ram was also the lead prosecutor for Najib’s trial over the alleged tampering of the auditor-general’s 2016 report on 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram was also the lead prosecutor for Rosmah’s trial over the soliciting and receiving of millions of ringgit in bribes in exchange for helping to secure a RM1.25 billion contract, and her separate money-laundering trial — which has yet to start — involving over RM7 million.

                Earlier, it was reported that the prosecution team had requested for the 1MDB trial to be deferred for today and tomorrow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib this morning informed the High Court that although today was scheduled for the continued hearing of Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s 1MDB trial, they were asking for a postponement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah then allowed the prosecution’s request and said the trial will resume this Thursday morning with the continued cross-examination of 41st prosecution witness and former AmBank relationship manager Joanna Yu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday afternoon, Sri Ram — who was the lead prosecutor for the 1MDB trial — died at the age of 79 in a private hospital in Kuala Lumpur, following a lung infection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from the 1MDB trial, Sri Ram was also the lead prosecutor for Najib’s trial over the alleged tampering of the auditor-general’s 2016 report on 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram was also the lead prosecutor for Rosmah’s trial over the soliciting and receiving of millions of ringgit in bribes in exchange for helping to secure a RM1.25 billion contract, and her separate money-laundering trial — which has yet to start — involving over RM7 million.

                ChatGPT has taken the world by storm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elad Gil, a widely respected Silicon Valley angel investor—he made early bets on Airbnb, Instacart, and Square—believes “the fact that ChatGPT is down all the time right now is a great sign of product-market fit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s because too many people are using it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the lore in Silicon Valley that “you should grind eternally and then eventually something will work” is wrong, noting people have wasted years of their lives because of such “bad advice.” “People end up spending years and years and years of life just grinding away on something that isn’t going to work, because maybe it will work if I do these three more tweaks, and maybe it will work this month if I keep going,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Most of the time, you should actually figure out when do you give up and when should you actually quit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s really hard to know.” Meanwhile, when an idea works, it tends to work very quickly, something he’s seen repeatedly with companies he’s worked at and invested in over the years—and now sees with OpenAI and ChatGPT

                ChatGPT has taken the world by storm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elad Gil, a widely respected Silicon Valley angel investor—he made early bets on Airbnb, Instacart, and Square—believes “the fact that ChatGPT is down all the time right now is a great sign of product-market fit
            </p>

            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Most of the time, you should actually figure out when do you give up and when should you actually quit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s really hard to know.” Meanwhile, when an idea works, it tends to work very quickly, something he’s seen repeatedly with companies he’s worked at and invested in over the years—and now sees with OpenAI and ChatGPT

                According to journalist Jacque Talbot, Mitchell is 'one of the front-runners' for the position and attended Liverpool's Premier League clash with Southampton just before the World Cup

                Mitchell has already proven that, like Edwards, he's an elite talent-spotter who would deserve the club's total faith

                Liverpool is looking for a replacement for Julian Ward, who in November announced his intention to leave the club at the end of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to journalist Jacque Talbot, Mitchell is 'one of the front-runners' for the position and attended Liverpool's Premier League clash with Southampton just before the World Cup
            </p>

                Pochettino's first transfer window was underwhelming

            <p>
                There are some similarities here with the task he would face at Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By working alongside Jürgen Klopp as he did with Pochettino, the hope would be that he would re-establish Liverpool as a title contender
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mitchell has already proven that, like Edwards, he's an elite talent-spotter who would deserve the club's total faith

                Singapore-based Sea will also open a cloud computing project in the Johor town of Kulai
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Aziz at the Shopee headquarters in Singapore on Jan 29, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shopee is the largest pan-regional e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan.  Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tengku Zafrul Aziz announced this move during his official visit to the company’s headquarters in Singapore on Sunday (Jan 29).  Sea's decision to expand its investment footprint in Malaysia reflects the company’s confidence in the prospects, as well as the operational and policy stability of the country’s business landscape, he added.  During the minister's visit, Sea shared its proposed expansion plans in Malaysia, involving the setting up of cloud computing services, data hosting and processing, as well as a new logistics e-commerce warehouse.  The cloud computing project will be located in a three-storey green facility in the Johor town of Kulai, said Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This includes local sourcing, vendor development and the strengthening of the local industrial ecosystem, particularly in the digital space," said Tengku Zafrul.  Tengku Zafrul's three-day investment mission to Singapore is in conjunction with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s first official visit to the country on Monday.  During the visit, he will also have one-on-one business meetings with the Yondr Group, a global leader in data centres and INSEACT, a Singapore-based alternative protein company which specialises in producing sustainable insect protein for aquaculture.  Sea's co-founder and group chief operating officer, Gang Ye said the decision was a significant development not just for the group, but also for the local digital ecosystem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sea has also laid off more than 7,000 employees - or about 10 per cent of its workforce - as of December last year.  Staff cuts were also made at Garena in September 2022, including the shutting down some major projects to boost Sea's profitability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That same month, more Shopee employees were also laid off, with some of them having their job offers rescinded days before they began work.

                Azalina said the court found such conduct by the alleged Sulu heirs to amount to a "manifestly illicit hardship" that is detrimental to Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak in 2010 declared Stampa as having no jurisdiction over Malaysia and ordered a stop to the continued arbitrations in Spain, Stampa and the Sulu claimants ignored a Spanish court's decision to cancel his appointment and shifted the entire arbitration to France
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ignoring the Spanish and French courts' decisions which meant the arbitration was illegitimate, Stampa on February 28, 2022, gave his arbitration decision — also known as the "final award" — to order Malaysia to pay US$14.92 billion to the eight Sulu claimants

            <p>
                Malaysia is currently challenging this ex parte order before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal

            <p>
                After the seizure order issued in July 2022, Azalina said Malaysia had immediately applied to the District Court of Luxembourg to obtain an interim relief to release or set aside the seizure order known as "saisie arrêt"
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 29 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will undertake his first official visit to Singapore tomorrow (Jan 30) at the invitation of his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian Foreign Ministry (Wisma Putra), in a statement, said Anwar – in his maiden visit to the republic after being sworn in as the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia – will be meeting President Halimah Yacob and Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Prime Minister will also hold an engagement with the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore," said the statement

            <p>
                The statement said the visit reflects the importance of the Malaysia-Singapore ties as close neighbours and partners in Asean
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar will be accompanied by his wife, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, and the delegation will comprise foreign affairs minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, Minister of Transport Anthony Loke Siew Fook, Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, Minister of Communications and Digital Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil, and officials from the relevant ministries and agencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Separately, Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said that Anwar’s visit to Singapore “underscores the close and enduring relationship between Singapore and Malaysia, and our peoples.” The ministry said Anwar will attend an official welcome ceremony at the Istana

                Mohamed Salah has struggled to produce his best form for Liverpool this season It's not just Saturday, since the World Cup or even this season that Salah has looked a little off form

            <p>
                Granted, he isn't quite man-marked out of game given his modest goals record this season but Liverpool's often relatively ponderous attacking build up is detrimental to Salah's game

            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp's tactics this term have forced Salah out to the right and have limited the forward Salah's drop in form could also come from a factor that no footballer can beat..

                Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has claimed that new signing Cody Gakpo is a ‘sensational’ finisher
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gakpo is yet to score in four games since his move from PSV Eindhoven
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is a smart boy, he really wants to learn and is a really good listener.” If Gakpo is indeed a sensational finisher, then he’s yet to show this at Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool could really do with that right now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As Klopp points out, he’s at Anfield for the long haul
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s likely that with Diogo Jota, Luis Diaz and Roberto Firmino all injured, Klopp isn’t able to use Gakpo exactly where he wants him too

                Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has claimed that new signing Cody Gakpo is a ‘sensational’ finisher
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gakpo is yet to score in four games since his move from PSV Eindhoven
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is a smart boy, he really wants to learn and is a really good listener.” If Gakpo is indeed a sensational finisher, then he’s yet to show this at Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool could really do with that right now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As Klopp points out, he’s at Anfield for the long haul
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s likely that with Diogo Jota, Luis Diaz and Roberto Firmino all injured, Klopp isn’t able to use Gakpo exactly where he wants him too

                Man United defender Harry Maguire heaped special praise on Casemiro after their FA Cup win over Reading
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, Casemiro fired home a brilliant second, bending home a delicious effort from outside the penalty area, ahead of substitute Fred flicking the ball home from close range to make it 3-0
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In and out of possession he has really improved us." Victory over the Royals marked United's 11th successive win on their own patch, meaning you have to go back to the goalless draw with Newcastle United on October 16 for the last time they failed to win at Old Trafford
            </p>

                About Us Advertise   WELLINGTON, Jan 29 — New Zealand police said today a fourth body was found after deadly record torrential rain and flooding devastated Auckland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two bodies were found in floodwater at separate locations Friday night in the northern suburb of Wairau Valley, and a third was discovered Saturday after a landslide brought down a home in central Auckland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, a drone operator discovered the body of a man about a kilometre from where he was swept away Friday at Onewhero, south of Auckland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The flooding situation has been a traumatic experience for everyone in Auckland,” New Zealand’s deputy prime minister Carmel Sepuloni said at a press conference in the city today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Friday’s torrential rain also flooded terminals at Auckland airport, which had to be closed before international flights could resume today
            </p>

                Sir Elton John was forced to cancel concerts in Auckland Friday and yesterday — part of his farewell tour — due to crowd safety

                About Us Advertise   WELLINGTON, Jan 29 — New Zealand police said today a fourth body was found after deadly record torrential rain and flooding devastated Auckland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two bodies were found in floodwater at separate locations Friday night in the northern suburb of Wairau Valley, and a third was discovered Saturday after a landslide brought down a home in central Auckland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, a drone operator discovered the body of a man about a kilometre from where he was swept away Friday at Onewhero, south of Auckland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The flooding situation has been a traumatic experience for everyone in Auckland,” New Zealand’s deputy prime minister Carmel Sepuloni said at a press conference in the city today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Friday’s torrential rain also flooded terminals at Auckland airport, which had to be closed before international flights could resume today

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 29 — Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor said he now leads Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah, also known as Gagasan Rakyat, to end his “party-less” status and strengthen his standing as the Sabah chief minister

                On January 6, Hajiji’s position as chief minister was undermined when Sabah Umno chief Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin pulled the plug on their relationship with the GRS government, which caused Hajiji to lose the majority he had to form the state Cabinet
