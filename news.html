                But lately, Burry’s been doing a lot of musing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This time is different,” he wrote in a cryptic tweet on Tuesday that included a chart showing the roughly 40% stock market drop—and multiple bear market rallies—that occurred during the dot-com bubble of early 2000s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Burry also plotted the steep decline in the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate during the dot-com era, hinting at the stark contrast between the Fed’s current rate trajectory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the chart Burry shared from 2000 and 2001, the S&P 500 experienced a strong bear market rally after the Fed cut rates in September of 2001, leading some investors to believe stocks were set to soar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the rally proved to be short lived, and the bear market didn’t end until more than a year later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Burry’s tweet seems to be hinting that enthusiasm that the stock market will continue on an upward trajectory is misplaced, and that history is repeating itself here
            </p>

                But lately, Burry’s been doing a lot of musing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This time is different,” he wrote in a cryptic tweet on Tuesday that included a chart showing the roughly 40% stock market drop—and multiple bear market rallies—that occurred during the dot-com bubble of early 2000s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Burry also plotted the steep decline in the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate during the dot-com era, hinting at the stark contrast between the Fed’s current rate trajectory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the chart Burry shared from 2000 and 2001, the S&P 500 experienced a strong bear market rally after the Fed cut rates in September of 2001, leading some investors to believe stocks were set to soar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the rally proved to be short lived, and the bear market didn’t end until more than a year later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Burry’s tweet seems to be hinting that enthusiasm that the stock market will continue on an upward trajectory is misplaced, and that history is repeating itself here
            </p>

                International prosecutors said on Wednesday they had found "strong indications" that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the use in Ukraine of a Russian missile system that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over eastern Ukraine in 2014

                For motorcyclist safety, this was comprised of 4.00 for blind spot detection, zero for rear visualisation, 1.00 for headlight, 2.00 for pedestrian and zero for the advanced MST test

                Khairy also said the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines had taken into account the views of all government agencies

            <p>
                Earlier Wednesday (Feb 8), Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said that certain parts of the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines were signed off by the relevant minister without the approval or agreement of the Attorney General
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba was the then health minister from 2020 till Aug 2021 and Khairy was the science, technology and innovation minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin resigned as prime minister in August 2021, Khairy took over as health minister and Adham became the science, technology and innovation minister

                No complaints from Najib Throughout the years when she was acting as the AmBank relationship manager for Najib’s private accounts, Yu confirmed she had never received any complaints from Najib himself or his mandate holder Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil that his five accounts were not being operated according to the mandate

                (Najib had previously written to AmBank to inform that Nik Faisal was his mandate holder or authorised person to handle his accounts on his behalf.) Based on the mandate letters, Yu confirmed that it would not have been possible for Nik Faisal or Low Taek Jho to issue or sign cheques on behalf of Najib, as Najib would have to sign the cheques himself

                SINGAPORE — Ikea is looking into possible insect infestation in its sofa range after a customer posted on video hosting platform TikTok a video showing black bugs swarming a grey sofa she bought from the furniture giant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She claimed the insects spread to her other wood furniture at home, and that she called Ikea three times about the incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spokesman noted that the customer contacted Ikea on Jan 30 and the company resolved the incident with her on Tuesday

                Ikea Singapore has reached out to Ikea global for support

            <p>
                In a video posted on TikTok, she can be seen taking a basket on display in an Ikea showroom and knocking it on the floor a few times, so that black insects fall on the floor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A check on Wednesday revealed that the Knipsa basket cannot be found on Ikea Singapore’s website

                SINGAPORE — Ikea is looking into possible insect infestation in its sofa range after a customer posted on video hosting platform TikTok a video showing black bugs swarming a grey sofa she bought from the furniture giant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She claimed the insects spread to her other wood furniture at home, and that she called Ikea three times about the incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spokesman noted that the customer contacted Ikea on Jan 30 and the company resolved the incident with her on Tuesday
            </p>

                Ikea Singapore has reached out to Ikea global for support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a video posted on TikTok, she can be seen taking a basket on display in an Ikea showroom and knocking it on the floor a few times, so that black insects fall on the floor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A check on Wednesday revealed that the Knipsa basket cannot be found on Ikea Singapore’s website

                Having kept their 2023 MotoGP aerodynamics under wraps for as long as possible, the latest downforce developments began to emerge during the Sepang Shakedown Test

                Crutchlow finished the test second overall behind Pirro and spent much of the final day using the latest 'stealth' aero (without a number on it)

            <p>
                KTM added some intrigue by turning off the transponder on lead test rider Dani Pedrosa's bikes, but the Spaniard was seen using both a full Red Bull liveried 2022 fairing and then the following prototype, which looked to be a tweaked version of a new fairing at the Valencia test
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Due to rain delays on Days 1 and 2, more innovations could hit the track at the official test

            <p>
                Honda's test rider Stefan Bradl appeared to have the least aero changes, relative to Valencia test, where they had already used the Ducati-style lower ducts and rear seat wings

            <p>
                On Jan 30, the victim’s ex-wife Nurima Juli, 33, who is unemployed, was charged with the murder in an oil palm plantation near Jalan Anjur Juara, Jalan Apas, Batu 5, here between 7.3pm0 to 9pm on Jan 13

                On Tuesday (Jan 31), Idris was quoted saying the murder was motivated by jealousy, and did not involve security issues in Sabah.

                Ambiga took a jab over Nurul Izzah's appointment, sarcastically hinting that Anwar's government would be open to nepotism in a tweet on Tuesday (Feb 7)

            <p>
                Anwar had previously stressed that Nurul Izzah's appointment was not a form of nepotism as she would not have any authority over issues nor would she receive a salary from the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that Nurul Izzah's role was purely an advisory one and he had appointed her out of her eagerness to help him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also personally reassured that there would be no misuse of power or corruption during his administration

                Ambiga took a jab over Nurul Izzah's appointment, sarcastically hinting that Anwar's government would be open to nepotism in a tweet on Tuesday (Feb 7)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar had previously stressed that Nurul Izzah's appointment was not a form of nepotism as she would not have any authority over issues nor would she receive a salary from the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that Nurul Izzah's role was purely an advisory one and he had appointed her out of her eagerness to help him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also personally reassured that there would be no misuse of power or corruption during his administration

                Overnight, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stuck to the Fed’s mantra, that being, further rate hikes are coming and that rates will need to stay high for quite a while to get inflation back down to their target of around 2%

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! As The Telegraph reported last month, Liverpool remains keen on Wolves midfielder Matheus Nunes

            <p>
                Like Keïta, Nunes is a different type of midfielder from what you might typically associate with Jürgen Klopp, but his ability to keep possession under pressure and decisively move it forward is exactly what Liverpool is currently missing

                Keïta has missed 86 matches since the start of the 2018 season when he came to Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, if Nunes does arrive at Liverpool in the summer, Keïta will be adequately replaced in terms of quality and style, and considerably upgraded in terms of availability

                Manchester United are preparing for a Qatar-based bid to rid the Red Devils of their controversial Glazer ownership Manchester United is to be the subject of a Qatar-based ownership bid within the coming days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's according to the Mail (opens in new tab), who says that United could be the next Premier League club to be taken over by Middle Eastern buyers, following Manchester City and Newcastle United, owned by UAE and Saudi Arabian groups, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There could be plans, too, to give Erik ten Hag a huge transfer budget to reshape the Red Devils as he sees fit.   According to the report, "high-wealth individuals based in the oil-rich state, buoyed by Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup, have set their sights on a club they view as ‘football’s crown jewels’." United are one of the highest-profile clubs in the world, of course, and the most successful Premier League side ever with 13 titles in the modern era.  Qatar's monarch Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani is apparently a big United fan – and with current owners, the Glazer family, setting a deadline for bids somewhere in the middle of February, there is hope that a bid for the club could be made swiftly.  The report states, too, that the investors interested in purchasing Manchester United are a different group from those who own Paris Saint-German, Qatari Sports Investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Along with a Qatari-based bid, United are expecting interest from Sir Jim Ratcliffe (opens in new tab), owner of Ligue 1 side Nice and long-standing United supporter.  UFC star Conor McGregor has also touted potentially buying (opens in new tab) the Old Trafford outfit.  Formal bids are set to be submitted to buy United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The club had a quiet January window but brought in Marcel Sabitzer on deadline day after Christian Eriksen picked up a long-term injury
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former United chairman Martin Edwards, meanwhile, has spoken to FFT about how the club's 1991 European Cup Winners' Cup victory helped changed the perception of English football across the continent

                The country should be sensitive to market trends and allow such re-opening initiatives as the local tourism industry was still recovering from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, he added

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, Feb 8 — The customer dress code requirement should be eliminated entirely at police stations, said Sarawak United People’s Party (SUPP) Women chief Kho Teck Wan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said it was the honourable responsibility of the police to protect and serve the public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Police officers should not be burdened with the added responsibility of first determining the complainant’s dress code then classifying the severity of complaints before allowing any complainant to lodge a report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kho said that Acryl had indicated that dress code at the police station can be relaxed based on the type of emergency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I am in the opinion that the dress code requirement should be eliminated entirely at police stations,” she stressed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, the dress code should not be applied to service counters and stations that handle complaints or emergency cases such as the police station, fire department and clinics

                Zoom will incur about $50 million to $68 million in charges related to the layoffs, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday

                "I would say incrementally, maybe this is telling us we shouldn't expect reacceleration in the near-term on the revenue side, but we could see additional upside to margins for a company that is already profitable," RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria said

                The fact that one of the greatest players of all time in Bayern Munich and Germany legend Lothar Matthaus rates Randal Kolo Muani as highly as he does should music to the ears of every Liverpool fan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 24-year-old has reportedly been valued at a steep £88 million price tag, who has been speculated with a move to Manchester United which would make him the club’s record signing, even surpassing the £85 million fee the club paid to sign Darwin Nunez from Benfica
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thankfully for Liverpool, they can sleep well knowing that if they shell out such a sizable fee for the ‘robust’ Randal Kolo Muani, it may well be worth it as Lothar Mathaus has given him a major stamp of approval

                It’s the mark of future greats”, Lothar Matthaus said about the Liverpool target, as quoted by Jeunes Footeux
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Looking at the sorry state of affairs at Anfield, how can one expect the player to pick them of all destinations? Liverpool are languishing in 10th place in the Premier League table, having not won a single game in 2023 and with there being no clarity over their penny-pinching owners leaving, which would leave Randal Kolo Muani no choice but to go elsewhere, with a club bringing in a potential legend in the making, as per Lothar Matthaus at least

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Manchester United are yet to make a decision over their priority transfer target this summer with Erik ten Hag set to choose between Harry Kane or Victor Osimhen, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Telegraph reports that Kane and Osimhen are the two players who currently top United’s shortlist, while Ten Hag is still determining which striker would work best in his system at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report claims that Ten Hag has been keeping tabs on Osimhen’s performances for Napoli since the start of the season but is ‘unsure’ over some parts of the 24-year-old’s game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, it’s claimed that Ten Hag understands that Kane offers a ‘unique skillset’ and would be a ‘strong character’ at United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, both Kane and Osimhen are likely to cost United at least £100 million this summer but the Nigeria international would offer Ten Hag a longer-term solution if he proves to be a success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Napoli would also command in excess of £100m for Osimhen, who is the top scorer in Serie A this season with 16 goals for Napoli

                Tech and growth-focused stocks have dominated markets for over a decade, but a “paradigm shift” is coming as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to fight inflation, according to Steve Eisman, senior portfolio manager at the Neuberger Berman Group

            <p>
                He described how former stock market leaders were overtaken during past market paradigm shifts like the one happening now, noting that the financial stocks which outperformed before 2008, “literally did nothing until 2020.” “Call it a dozen years where the old leadership group evaporated,” he said

                The hedge funder went on to argue that the rise of growth and tech stocks that were market leaders to start the year is an example of how “people don’t give up paradigms easily.” The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up more than 13% year to date, and Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF—which focuses on tech and growth stocks and became a bellwether for the sector during the pandemic—is up more than 37%

                Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are on their way out include coupe and convertible versions of the C-Class and E-Class, which are due to be dropped sometime between 2023 and 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, coupe-like SUVs and sedans will also be removed from the line-up, with the CLS set to depart in 2024, and the GT 4-Door Coupe set to follow in 2024 or 2025
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The CLA is also available as a wagon (called the Shooting Brake), and will still be offered in said body style in its next generation due in 2025, although this will be its last
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It isn’t all doom and gloom though, as there will be a new Mercedes-AMG GT coupe that is reportedly based on the current SL roadster, which itself is said to gain a Maybach version
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2026, a new four-door coupe, a next-generation SL and a new AMG GT Coupe – all of which will be electric – are set to make their debut

                Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are on their way out include coupe and convertible versions of the C-Class and E-Class, which are due to be dropped sometime between 2023 and 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, coupe-like SUVs and sedans will also be removed from the line-up, with the CLS set to depart in 2024, and the GT 4-Door Coupe set to follow in 2024 or 2025
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The CLA is also available as a wagon (called the Shooting Brake), and will still be offered in said body style in its next generation due in 2025, although this will be its last
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It isn’t all doom and gloom though, as there will be a new Mercedes-AMG GT coupe that is reportedly based on the current SL roadster, which itself is said to gain a Maybach version
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2026, a new four-door coupe, a next-generation SL and a new AMG GT Coupe – all of which will be electric – are set to make their debut

                Transport Minister Anthony Loke gave the assurance when he made the announcement on the future of Subang Airport, which is being served by KTM’s dedicated airport service called the Skypark Link that connects passengers from KL Sentral all the way to the airport by making only one stop along the way – at the Subang Jaya station where it is also integrated with the Kelana Jaya LRT line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Introduced in May 2018, the Skypark Link, a limited express service, is the second rail service after the Express Rail Link that connects KL Sentral with Kuala Lumpur International Airport and KLIA2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The distance from KL Sentral to the Skypark Terminal is 26km, though the bulk of the construction cost lies in the 9km link that consists of twin tracks that begin from Subang Jaya all the way to the airport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In view of this, KTM will suspend this service beginning Feb 15 until things improve

            <p>
                “As announced last week, the trainsets will be deployed for the KTM Komuter service in the northern sector, between Padang Besar and Butterworth,” said Loke

                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim (fourth, left) delivers a speech at a meeting with members of the Prime Minister's Department at Dewan De' Seri Endon, Puspanitapuri

            <p>
                The Prime Minister said at the monthly Prime Minister's Department gathering here on Tuesday (Feb 7) that his "friends" in the Cabinet had given their cooperation so far, even those who had "history" with him
            </p>

                "We are working well together, even though we have 'history', clashes in ideas and had major fights especially between me and the deputy prime minister on my right," he laughed, referring to Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi

                Anwar's party PKR and Ahmad Zahid's Umno have been each other's political nemesis for years until after the 15th General Election.

                The research house said this in a note on Monday (Feb 6) that analysed the potential reason for the 127% jump in ATA IMS' share price to close at 46.5 sen last Friday, from 20.5 sen on Jan 20

            <p>
                The potential new customer could boost ATA IMS’s future earnings prospects, after the company reported a core net loss of RM23 million for the first six months ended Sept 30, 2022 (6MFY2023), he said

                Assuming that ATA IMS has secured a new multinational corporation customer for box-built assembly products, the company could post FY2024 core net profit accretion of RM31.5 million, and FY2025 core net profit accretion of RM105 million, under a blue-sky scenario that the roll-out of the first product model to the customer is in June 2023, with four new product models in February 2024, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the target price for ATA IMS would have a 79% upside to 83 sen per share in the blue-sky scenario, but a 54% downside in the bear-case scenario to 21 sen on the assumption of no new customer wins for FY2024 to FY2025
            </p>

                Nagulan observed that ATA IMS sat on net cash of RM18.3 million as at end-September 2022, which represented net cash per share of two sen

                Nepal's 7.8-magnitude earthquake in 2015 claimed nearly 9,000 lives

                He also said he had the requisite experience to handle a local government role as he was a three time incumbent in Rembau and was also the former minister of health and sports

                Khairy said he had discussed the matter with former supreme council member Tan Sri Noh Omar and former Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan who were also part of those purged from the party.

                Travellers cross at Lo Wu Control Point on the first day China fully resumed cross border travel to Hong Kong and Macao, in Hong Kong, China on Feb 6, 2023

            <p>
                The reopening came after Hong Kong announced a promotion campaign dubbed "Hello Hong Kong" to lure back visitors, businesses and investors to the financial hub after more than three years of tough COVID-19 curbs

            <p>
                On Sunday, Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi said anyone found littering in public places would face a RM500 fine, part of the state government's initiative to beef up enforcement of environmental cleanliness under the Johor Bersih initiative

            <p>
                He said the state government and all 16 local councils in Johor had discussed this matter, and it was time for serious action against those who disregard the rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We can issue a maximum fine of RM500 to those caught littering, under the Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Although the state government introduced the Johor Bersih initiative last year, the level of awareness among the public is still low,” he added.

                Mohd Jafni added that the government will not compromise on cleanliness and urged the public to adhere to the law
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi said anyone found littering in public places would face a RM500 fine, part of the state government's initiative to beef up enforcement of environmental cleanliness under the Johor Bersih initiative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the state government and all 16 local councils in Johor had discussed this matter, and it was time for serious action against those who disregard the rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We can issue a maximum fine of RM500 to those caught littering, under the Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Although the state government introduced the Johor Bersih initiative last year, the level of awareness among the public is still low,” he added.

                AFP correspondents in northern Syria said terrified residents ran out of their homes after the earthquake struck before dawn near the Turkish city of Gaziantep, about 40km from the Syrian border

                Kangar OCPD Asst Comm Yusharifuddin Mohd Yusop said the 39-year-old man, who works as a lorry driver transporting fertiliser, was remanded for three days, starting from the date of his arrest on Feb 4, until Tuesday (Feb 7) to assist in the investigation

            <p>
                On Feb 4, the suspect uploaded a 35-second long video, through his TikTok account, showing three traffic police officers conducting a routine inspection on Jalan Kangar-Alor Setar near the Simpang Ampat traffic lights in Perlis

                That will extend even further to age 75 in 2033
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One exception that may let you push your RMD from an employer-sponsored 401(k) or (403(b) plan even further down the line is simply not retiring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you continue to work past age 73 and do not own more than 5% of the business you work for, most employer plans allow you to defer your RMD until April 1 of the year after you retire from that employer’s plan, according to IRS Publication 575
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And when you decide to retire officially will make a difference in when your RMD must start
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So you’re still on the hook to take an RMD from any IRAs (including SEP and SIMPLE IRAs) or any tax-deferred retirement accounts you own in a former employer’s plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another strategy to steer clear of the RMD rule is to convert a traditional IRA, or part of it, into a Roth IRA

                One exception that may let you push your RMD from an employer-sponsored 401(k) or (403(b) plan even further down the line is simply not retiring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you continue to work past age 73 and do not own more than 5% of the business you work for, most employer plans allow you to defer your RMD until April 1 of the year after you retire from that employer’s plan, according to IRS Publication 575
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And when you decide to retire officially will make a difference in when your RMD must start
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So you’re still on the hook to take an RMD from any IRAs (including SEP and SIMPLE IRAs) or any tax-deferred retirement accounts you own in a former employer’s plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another strategy to steer clear of the RMD rule is to convert a traditional IRA, or part of it, into a Roth IRA
            </p>

                Works Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi took to Facebook to express his dismay at the cuts as it will affect MPs serving constituencies in the interior, particularly in Sarawak

            <p>
                The allocation cut saw several backbenchers from both sides of the political divide voicing their dismay, saying that it would affect their service to the people

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Nanta, who is Kapit MP, noted that the decrease in allocation would make it difficult for him and other MPs to address the needs of constituents in the rural and interior areas

            <p>
                Although upset at the allocation cut, Nanta said he has to accept the decision with the hope that it would be increased again from time to time.

                Man Utd are set to be without midfielder Casemiro for three matches following his red card against Crystal Palace
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United continued their rejuvenation under Erik ten Hag with another home win at the weekend, the type of straightforward victory that they have become accustomed to recording in recent months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That could become even clearer in the coming weeks, with the Brazilian set to miss the next three Premier League matches through suspension after his red card at the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In order to do so, Ten Hag will be hoping his side can dominate possession and minimise the need for a defensive specialist, though that will be particularly tricky with Eriksen also out injured
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What was clear from the Arsenal defeat is that United paid the price for not adapting the set-up to cater for the loss of Casemiro, and across the next three matches solving that must be a priority

                Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has come under increased pressure, with last season's Premier League runners-up losing a third straight away league game on Saturday Former Liverpool star Jamie Carragher claimed Reds fans will still want Jurgen Klopp in the dugout at the start of next season despite the Reds' recent struggles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was the third time in a row that Liverpool have lost away from home in the league, while they have still yet to win a game in the competition in 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There's a lot of questions that need to be asked and a lot of answers to be found, but at the start of next season I don't think there's anyone Liverpool supporters would want in that dugout other than Jurgen Klopp," Sky Sports pundit Carragher said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool's only victory in 2023 came in a previous game against Wolves in their FA Cup third round replay, but Brighton eliminated Klopp's team in the very next round of the competition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Carragher also hit out at Liverpool's transfer policy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They've got to the start of this season, and from day one at Fulham, they haven't been able to cope with the intensity of a Premier League game of football and they've been ran over in every game that they've played." Does Jurgen Klopp deserve more time? Have your say in the comments section Klopp himself accepted there were no excuses after his team's slow start at Molineux

                Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has come under increased pressure, with last season's Premier League runners-up losing a third straight away league game on Saturday Former Liverpool star Jamie Carragher claimed Reds fans will still want Jurgen Klopp in the dugout at the start of next season despite the Reds' recent struggles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was the third time in a row that Liverpool have lost away from home in the league, while they have still yet to win a game in the competition in 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There's a lot of questions that need to be asked and a lot of answers to be found, but at the start of next season I don't think there's anyone Liverpool supporters would want in that dugout other than Jurgen Klopp," Sky Sports pundit Carragher said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool's only victory in 2023 came in a previous game against Wolves in their FA Cup third round replay, but Brighton eliminated Klopp's team in the very next round of the competition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Carragher also hit out at Liverpool's transfer policy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They've got to the start of this season, and from day one at Fulham, they haven't been able to cope with the intensity of a Premier League game of football and they've been ran over in every game that they've played." Does Jurgen Klopp deserve more time? Have your say in the comments section Klopp himself accepted there were no excuses after his team's slow start at Molineux

            </p>
            
            <p>
                There may well be interest in Osimhen from elsewhere as well, with Bayern Munich and Real Madrid also touted in the report as potential suitors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If any Premier League clubs do fork out £107m for the striker then it would break the British transfer record which Chelsea just set by spending £105m on midfielder Enzo Fernandez from Benfica

                Out of the RM40 million, a total RM24 million is for the redevelopment of the Bukit Mertajam market while the remaining RM16 million is for the maintenance fund of stratified public housing in Penang

                Labelling it as a “big angpao” for Penang, he said the RM16 million was an increase of 70 per cent in the federal government’s allocation last year for the maintenance of public housing in Penang

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 6 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim clapped back at corrupt naysayers who voiced their displeasure at the appointment of Nurul Izzah Anwar as his financial adviser
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Nurul Izzah will not use the position to enrich herself and her family unlike those who came before him who he said had awarded contracts to their cronies and family members to the tune of billions of ringgit

                Despite this, Arsenal's new number 20 is choosing to look ahead to next weekend's clash at home to Brentford after taking to social media to reveal that whilst his debut didn't go the way he would have wanted, it's important the players and supporters stick together after the defeat

                "Thank you for the support."  The 31-year-old's message was 'liked' by Rob Holding - an unused substitute at Goodison Park - brought out a love heart and muscle emoji from captain Martin Odegaard and echoed what Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has said about bouncing back from the loss immediately

                Despite this, Arsenal's new number 20 is choosing to look ahead to next weekend's clash at home to Brentford after taking to social media to reveal that whilst his debut didn't go the way he would have wanted, it's important the players and supporters stick together after the defeat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Not the way I wanted the first one to be but we bounce back and push even more all together," he wrote on Instagram
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Thank you for the support."  The 31-year-old's message was 'liked' by Rob Holding - an unused substitute at Goodison Park - brought out a love heart and muscle emoji from captain Martin Odegaard and echoed what Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has said about bouncing back from the loss immediately

            <p>
                Not only would he be able to provide cover for Salah in attack, but Doan could be brought on towards the dying embers of the game for the Egyptian in order to defend Liverpool’s position

                That's why I'm not satisfied." With ambitions like that, if a club like Liverpool does come knocking on the door, Freiburg surely won’t stand in his way.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                A typical right-winger with an explosive nature and the ability to cut in from the right in the same way as Salah, Doan hasn’t just been impressing at the tournament though
            </p>

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! He’s also been a linchpin at Freiburg since arriving at the Bundesliga side this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only would he be able to provide cover for Salah in attack, but Doan could be brought on towards the dying embers of the game for the Egyptian in order to defend Liverpool’s position
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's why I'm not satisfied." With ambitions like that, if a club like Liverpool does come knocking on the door, Freiburg surely won’t stand in his way.

                The site near Sungai Melaka was a Portuguese chapel and is located in the heart of the historic city, not far from other historical sites
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The site was either destroyed or allowed to fall into ruin during the Dutch occupation of Melaka in 1641 and was subsequently taken over by St Peter's Church
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, a check on Sunday (Feb 5) night found that the site has been left to deteriorate and the surroundings are unlit

            <p>
                A 10-minute observation of the site found those gathering at the river walkway were not aware of the site's history

            <p>
                She said Perzim was willing to do its part to preserve and promote the site if a request is made by the custodian of the site
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We are willing to work together with stakeholders to preserve the site and other historical icons," she said on Monday (Feb 6)

                The Skypark terminal at the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang, suburban Kuala Lumpur on May 12, 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking to local media, Mr Loke said the plan will see the airport - known formally as the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport - handle up to eight million passengers annually.  “I think this is a major game-changer as far as Subang Airport is concerned,” Mr Loke was quoted as saying by Malay Mail.  Mr Loke told local media that there were seven areas that the redevelopment plan will focus on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These include the introduction of commercial jet passenger flights for general aviation, business aviation, urban air mobility as well as regional commercial flight operations among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) began operations in 1998, (Subang Airport) gradually winded down its operations and jet engines were disallowed from operating
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “One of the biggest policy changes is that the government is now allowing narrow-body jets to operate again in this airport, but for this to happen there must be redevelopment (of the airport terminals),” he said, as quoted by Malay Mail.  The online portal added that Mr Loke stressed that Subang Airport’s redevelopment is not aimed at replacing KLIA in Sepang, but to transform it into a city airport that complements the international airport.  Just last month, local media reported Tourism Minister Tiong King Sing urging the Home Ministry to improve wait times at KLIA for incoming travellers, citing two-hour-long waits at its immigration counters.  "If Malaysia wants to welcome tourists and make the country a competitive destination of choice, we need to solve this problem as soon as possible to avoid the image of the Immigration Department being tarnished,” he reportedly said.  He said that the delays at the immigration counters reveal the outdated inspection procedure at KLIA and suggested that airport authorities deploy multilingual staff as well as for the facial recognition system to be extended to international visitors.  "The facial recognition system used by the Immigration Department should also be extended to all international visitors, not just limited to those with long-term passes to facilitate the clearance process," he was quoted as saying by New Straits Times.

                There was a time not so long ago when playing Rashford through the middle would induce a shake of the head from United supporters, but right now the 25-year-old looks like the first name on the teamsheet for all three attacking positions

                There's no doubt he is at his best coming off the left for Manchester United, but having spent much of his career pigeonholed in that role, he has shown he can do it all this season

                Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool are struggling at the moment and in order to fix his problems, the Liverpool manager should look to copy Sir Alex Ferguson's methods
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's now been over seven years of Klopp building this cycle of Liverpool players, and it seems like he is approaching its use-by date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Sooner or later, Klopp and his recruitment team must decide to be ruthless if they want to get Liverpool back to the pinnacle of the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Right now, Liverpool has one of the oldest squads in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's clear, if FSG is not going to sell the club, Liverpool is going to have to operate on a sell-to-buy basis and the best way to raise funds is to sell some of Liverpool's players entering their 30s when they still have some value left
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is what Klopp may just have to do, especially if his Liverpool team continues to perform in the same way they have since the start of the year.

                Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool are struggling at the moment and in order to fix his problems, the Liverpool manager should look to copy Sir Alex Ferguson's methods
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's now been over seven years of Klopp building this cycle of Liverpool players, and it seems like he is approaching its use-by date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Sooner or later, Klopp and his recruitment team must decide to be ruthless if they want to get Liverpool back to the pinnacle of the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Right now, Liverpool has one of the oldest squads in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's clear, if FSG is not going to sell the club, Liverpool is going to have to operate on a sell-to-buy basis and the best way to raise funds is to sell some of Liverpool's players entering their 30s when they still have some value left
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is what Klopp may just have to do, especially if his Liverpool team continues to perform in the same way they have since the start of the year.

                The US assessed it to have been a spy balloon, while the Chinese maintains it was for meteorological research

                A balloon flies in the sky over Billings, Montana, US, on Feb 1, 2023

            <p>
                Both governments have sought to play down the incident, insisting that they will continue to keep communication lines open, while China has made a rare admission of error in expressing regret the balloon drifted off course

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 4 — The federal government should maintain if not increase its spending on public healthcare when it retables Budget 2023 in Parliament in the next few weeks, the Galen Centre for Health and Social Policy said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its CEO Azrul Mohd Khalib warned that any cuts to public healthcare would lead to a collapse of the entire system that has been buckling under the strain of the Covid-19 pandemic the last few years even as he expressed alarm at the recent news reports of burnout among the country’s shrinking medical workforce
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azrul’s warning comes ahead of the Anwar administration’s plan to retable a revision to the Budget in Parliament on February 24, to reflect the country’s national debt and liabilities currently amounting to RM1.5 trillion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Budget 2023 had been tabled last October by the previous government then led by Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob but was not debated on or passed, due to the dissolution of Parliament that paved the way for the 15th general election last November

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 4 — A DAP federal lawmaker today called on the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and the Election Commission (EC) to investigate Bersatu’s partners in the Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition for possible fund abuses during last year’s contentious general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kampar MP Chong Zhemin said that since the anti-graft watchdog had frozen Bersatu’s bank accounts, it should also look into the accounts of both PAS and Gerakan to check the source of its campaign funds for GE15 last November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Where did Perikatan Nasional receive such a huge amount of money to use in the election campaign?” Chong asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He cited Article 19(1)(a) of the Election Offences Act 1954 which restricts the spending of each election candidate to RM200,000 maximum for parliamentary seats, and RM100,000 for state seats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I urge the Election Commission (EC) to also investigate whether the expenditures of PN candidates in the general election have exceeded the legal limit,” added Chong who is also Perak DAP publicity secretary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Wedneday, MACC confirmed that it had suspended Bersatu’s bank accounts to facilitate investigations under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 that began last December

                Musk is likely to “double down” on his communication tactics after the verdict, said Minor Myers, a professor of corporate law at the University of Connecticut

                “I expect Elon is going to write anything he wants,” Musk himself thanked the jury on Twitter ― which he bought in October for US$44 billion (RM187.4 billion)

                Musk's raw tweeting style has made him a hero for many, and burnished the Tesla brand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tweets led to Musk and Tesla paying US$40 million to resolve US Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges under a consent agreement that Musk has fought unsuccessfully to lift
            </p>

                Musk is likely to “double down” on his communication tactics after the verdict, said Minor Myers, a professor of corporate law at the University of Connecticut

                “I expect Elon is going to write anything he wants,” Musk himself thanked the jury on Twitter ― which he bought in October for US$44 billion (RM187.4 billion)

                The Tesla shareholders who sued Musk had sought billions of dollars in damages

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tweets led to Musk and Tesla paying US$40 million to resolve US Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges under a consent agreement that Musk has fought unsuccessfully to lift

                On Thursday, State Islamic Religious Affairs Committee chairman Mohd Fared Mohd Khalid said Muslims in Johor are allowed to attend celebrations held by people of other faiths, but they should not take part in their religious rituals

            <p>
                “In this context, organisers of non-Muslim celebrations should be sensitive and ensure the sensitivity of Muslims is respected in line with Islam’s position as the federal religion and the official religion of Johor,” he had said at a press conference pertaining to the fatwa.

                Tomorrow, Sultan Ibrahim will be at Arulmigu Sri Balasubramaniar temple in Skudai here to attend the state-level Thaipusam celebration

                On Thursday, State Islamic Religious Affairs Committee chairman Mohd Fared Mohd Khalid said Muslims in Johor are allowed to attend celebrations held by people of other faiths, but they should not take part in their religious rituals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In this context, organisers of non-Muslim celebrations should be sensitive and ensure the sensitivity of Muslims is respected in line with Islam’s position as the federal religion and the official religion of Johor,” he had said at a press conference pertaining to the fatwa.

                The lawyer then moved on to Yu’s purported reasons for her termination, stating that one of the reasons for her being fired was that she had obtained approval from a third party, namely Low, in relation to Najib’s accounts

                She was referring to text messages brought up by Najib’s lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah at Najib’s trial involving the misappropriation of RM2.3bil of 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) funds, Bernama reported

            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee said that according to the chats, Low texted to Yu that “Mr Cheah (then AmBank managing director) is leaving the board at the end of this month and we don’t have access to the account holder

            <p>
                The lawyer then moved on to Yu’s purported reasons for her termination, stating that one of the reasons for her being fired was that she had obtained approval from a third party, namely Low, in relation to Najib’s accounts

                Justice Sequerah said one of the bail conditions was for the accused to surrender his passport to the court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Sequerah said the court, however, took cognisance of the fact that Ahmad Zahid, as a Deputy Prime Minister and the Rural and Regional Development Minister, has official duties to perform
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court allowed Ahmad Zahid to have temporary access to his passport for the purpose of applying for a diplomatic passport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following this, Ahmad Zahid would have to return his passport to the court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 20, Ahmad Zahid filed the application for the permanent release of his passport, which he said was done bona fide (with good intentions) so that he could perform his official duties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid stated that he needed the passport returned because he was required to travel outside of the country as part of his duties, and that it would also assist him in applying for a diplomatic passport for official travel

                Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil in a statement Sunday (Feb 4) said the memorandum of understanding signed by both countries provided a platform for agencies in Malaysia and Singapore to forge deeper cooperation in the three areas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The collaboration involves the sharing of information and expertise as well as best practices between Malaysia and Singapore in dealing with the issue of online fraud more effectively and optimising the use of data as a valuable commodity resource in the growth of the country's digital economy, among other things," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fahmi said this following his meeting with Singapore’s Communications and Information Minister Josephine Teo in Putrajaya Saturday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also present were Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon, Communications and Digital Ministry secretary-general Datuk Seri Mohammad Mentek and Singapore’s Communications and Information Ministry permanent secretary Joseph Leong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Fahmi also welcomed his Singaporean counterpart and her delegation to the 14th Muzika Ekstravaganza concert hosted by Malaysia on Saturday night

                Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil in a statement Sunday (Feb 4) said the memorandum of understanding signed by both countries provided a platform for agencies in Malaysia and Singapore to forge deeper cooperation in the three areas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The collaboration involves the sharing of information and expertise as well as best practices between Malaysia and Singapore in dealing with the issue of online fraud more effectively and optimising the use of data as a valuable commodity resource in the growth of the country's digital economy, among other things," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fahmi said this following his meeting with Singapore’s Communications and Information Minister Josephine Teo in Putrajaya Saturday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also present were Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon, Communications and Digital Ministry secretary-general Datuk Seri Mohammad Mentek and Singapore’s Communications and Information Ministry permanent secretary Joseph Leong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Fahmi also welcomed his Singaporean counterpart and her delegation to the 14th Muzika Ekstravaganza concert hosted by Malaysia on Saturday night

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 3 ― Chinese construction giant China Communications Construction Company was behind the land clearing reported to have taken place inside the Selangor State Park, Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari confirmed today

            <p>
                Amirudin told Malay Mail that CCCC had obtained the permit to clear land earmarked for a 2.3 kilometre road to be built for “entry facilities” but had begun construction “without approval.” Authorities are currently investigating the matter after a police report was lodged last December, the Gombak MP said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The CCCC had started work without approval and enforcement action had been taken December 2022,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Selangor MB did not elaborate if the company had been penalised or directed to stop all construction work

                State local government, public transport and new village development committee chairman Ng Sze Han said in December last year that the proposal had been approved only “in principle.” The Selangor State Park is over 108,000 hectares in size and was gazetted by the state on January 25, 2007

                Yu was AmBank’s relationship manager at that time and in charge of the politician’s account

            <p>
                Shafee focused on previous BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) chats Yu had with Low close to midnight on December 4, 2014, where she had suggested to Low for Najib’s accounts with AmBank to be closed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In those BBM messages in December 2014, she explained to Low that this was because Cheah Tek Kuang was leaving AmBank’s board by the end of the month and the bank would not have any direct access to the account holder Najib, and that Cheah’s replacement Ashok Ramamurthy would be updating Bank Negara Malaysia, AmBank’s chief risk officer and AmBank’s board about Najib’s accounts

            <p>
                Pointing out that the AmBank board was actually already aware of Najib’s accounts, Yu said her BBM messages on Najib’s accounts’ details being reported to the board were “just to get the account closed”, as Low had always insisted on strict confidentiality

                This will be similar to the system that will be used when the Rapid Transit System (RTS) operations begin in 2026.” The RTS link aims to connect the Bukit Chagar in Johor Bahru city to Woodlands in Singapore, serving about 10,000 passengers per hour each way to help ease traffic congestion on the Causeway.  CNA has reached out to Singapore's Immigration and Checkpoints Authority for further comments on the proposal laid out by Mr Fazli.  According to him, Johor was also looking for additional funding to increase motorcycle lanes from 50 to 75 each way at the Causeway.  Mr Fazli, who heads a multi-agency task force that looks into easing congestion at the Causeway and Second Link in Tuas, reportedly told The Star that there was a proposal for the lorry lanes to be used for passenger traffic on the weekends.  The Star reported that Johor chief minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi had previously appealed for something to be done about the situation at the Causeway, saying that about 150,000 regular commuters were being greatly inconvenienced by the heavy traffic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that a majority of commuters entering Singapore had to wake up at 4am to queue at the Johor Bahru border checkpoint by 5am in order to get through the traffic gridlock for work and return late at night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In December last year, Mr Onn Hafiz announced several measures aimed at reducing the congestion at Johor Bahru’s Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) complex during the tabling of the 2023 Johor state budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among the measures that Mr Onn Hafiz said will be implemented include the restructuring of lanes for motorcycles and cars entering as well as exiting Johor.  Last month, Malaysia's home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail announced that Singaporeans entering Johor via the two land checkpoints can now use electronic gate (e-gate) facilities which would benefit between 30,000 and 50,000 Singaporeans who visit Johor Bahru for social purposes

                The World Bank further recommended that Malaysia go ahead with its plans to reassess the country’s poverty line income and multidimensional poverty index

                The World Bank also said that Malaysia should increase its revenue collection, adding that the country has historically under collected in terms of personal and consumption taxes

            <p>
                “Currently, the government’s fiscal consolidation projects government revenue to decline further from 15 per cent of GDP in 2023 to an average of 14.7 per cent in the medium term

            <p>
                “With Malaysia’s revenue level remaining low and trailing comparative peers, it is important to address the persistent decline in revenue collection and explore new sources of revenue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that the tax base for personal income tax could be broadened while the consumption tax framework could be “enhanced”

                The areas mentioned were digital infrastructure, digital platforms, digital financial services, digital literacy and advanced digital skills, as well as digital safeguards

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 3 — Following an expected growth of 7.8 per cent in 2022, Malaysia’s economy is projected to grow at a “moderate pace” of 4.0 per cent this year, according to the World Bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its “Malaysia Economic Monitor February 2023” report released today, the World Bank attributed the lower growth rate partly to a troubled global economy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The World Bank previously announced that global economic growth is forecasted to decelerate sharply to 1.7 per cent in 2023, compared to a 2022 global growth rate of 2.8 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report also said that in line with a less supportive global environment, Malaysia’s trade growth is expected to slow down to 2.2 per cent in 2023, while import growth is projected to drop to 2.1 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, it said that government revenue is projected to decrease to 15 per cent of GDP this year — compared to the expected 16.7 per cent in 2022 — as crude oil prices come down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The main factor that is expected to drive Malaysia’s economic growth this year is domestic private spending

                Rallies, one held on Feb 1 at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, and another on Feb 2 near Google’s corporate offices in New York City, came after the company announced the largest reduction in its history – 12,000 positions, or 6% of its global workforce

            <p>

                Once a site has been onboarded, it then becomes available to end users for all the MNOs that have executed the Access Agreement with DNB.” DNB added that they have noted a significant increase in on-air sites recently with onboarding averaging hundreds of sites a week, and the difference between integrated and on-air sites is narrowing as the network reaches more telco customers

            <p>
                Explaining his decision, Sequerah noted that one of the bail conditions for Ahmad Zahid was for his passport to be surrendered to the court

            <p>
                Hisyam then immediately verbally applied for Ahmad Zahid’s passport to be temporarily returned for the purposes of applying for a diplomatic passport, which the judge then granted

                ‘Fever so high you feel like blacking out’ One parent, Ms Carol Loo, a 42-year-old financial consultant, said that her nine-year-old daughter fell sick over the first weekend of Chinese New Year, which began on Jan 22 this year

                Ford (F) earnings are set for release later today, a crucial report that follows blowout results from rival GM earlier this week

                GM also hit the top end of its full-year 2022 EBIT forecast, and also guided its full-year 2023 higher than analysts were expecting, seeing $11.5 billion in EBIT this year

                Last quarter Ford reiterated its full year 2022 EBIT forecast of $11.5 billion, and investors will be on the lookout for where 2023 guidance will land

                Aizat Fikri Nasir, who lodged a report with the ROS over the no-contest motion, disputed Ahmad Maslan's earlier statement, saying that he received a letter from the department dated Jan 26 stating that it was still in the midst of checking and investigating his complaint

                Emilia Hanafi, 43, said that she chose to work part-time because she had to manage the schooling of her three sons, aged 17, 12 and 10, including dropping them off and fetching them from school
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seventh prosecution witness told the court that she took up a part-time job to support the family, including her three sons, for whom the interim maintenance of RM2,000 received for each child was insufficient
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Emilia testified on Thursday, after the court allowed the application of lawyer, Datuk Akberdin Abdul Kader, who represented SM Faisal, for Emilia to be called to testify despite objection from the prosecution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DPP Zahida Zakaria, however, informed the court that she would file a revision application against the court's order for Emilia to testify on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thursday’s hearing was supposed to proceed with the sixth prosecution witness, Elisa Nani, who is Emilia's younger sister, to be cross-examined by the lawyer, but Akberdin applied for Emilia be called to testify first, because she is an important witness for the prosecution

                Thursday, 02 Feb 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joanna Yu, who is the 41st prosecution witness in the RM2.28bil 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) graft trial involving Najib, has consistently told the High Court that she dealt with Low, or better known as Jho Low, to get instructions on Najib's accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low's denial was brought up by Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah here at the High Court on Thursday (Feb 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defence has previously contended that Low was the "mastermind" behind the 1MDB scandal while Yu testified before that she would receive instructions from Low on managing Najib's bank account whenever she could not get hold of Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, who is the mandate holder to Najib's bank accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness said she was unsure how the questions were posed to Low by the MACC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness also said she had rejected job offers from Low several times because she did not want to work according to Low's lifestyle
            </p>
              
                		<p> </p>

                Thursday, 02 Feb 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joanna Yu, who is the 41st prosecution witness in the RM2.28bil 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) graft trial involving Najib, has consistently told the High Court that she dealt with Low, or better known as Jho Low, to get instructions on Najib's accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low's denial was brought up by Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah here at the High Court on Thursday (Feb 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defence has previously contended that Low was the "mastermind" behind the 1MDB scandal while Yu testified before that she would receive instructions from Low on managing Najib's bank account whenever she could not get hold of Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, who is the mandate holder to Najib's bank accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness said she was unsure how the questions were posed to Low by the MACC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness also said she had rejected job offers from Low several times because she did not want to work according to Low's lifestyle
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                In the statement of claim, Mohd Hatta said Dr Mahathir, who was then the seventh prime minister, had committed tort misfeasance in public office when he decided to postpone the HSR project, causing the government and the Malaysian people to pay compensation of almost RM46 million to the Singapore government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that Muhyiddin, who was then the eighth prime minister, also committed tort misfeasance in public office for terminating the project, causing the Malaysian government and the people to pay RM320,270,519.24 as compensation for the cancellation of the Bilateral Agreement between Malaysia and Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Hatta claimed that Mustapha, who was responsible for managing the project, had committed a similar offence by shelving the project, while Wee committed tort misfeasance in public office for denying the Malaysians their right to enjoy a first-class transport system with the cancellation of the HSR project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is seeking a court order to declare the cancellation of the project null and void, as well as for all the defendants to pay RM1 million compensation to him and all Malaysians for wrongfully and negligently cancelling the HSR project

            <p>
                On January 1, 2021, Malaysia and Singapore announced the termination of the 350-kilometre HSR project as the two countries failed to reach an agreement on changes proposed by Malaysia before the expiry of the project agreement on December 31, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Describing it as another significant victory for Malaysia against the self-claimed heirs, Azalina said the Spanish Court's annulment of Stampa’s appointment as arbitrator is final and reaffirms Malaysia’s position on the arbitration case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On June 29, 2021, the High Court of Justice of Madrid (HCJM) issued a decision that annulled the judicial appointment of Stampa to act as an arbitrator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stampa was initially appointed arbitrator in 2019 by the HCJM without Malaysia being involved in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The self-claimed Sulu claimants recognised that Stampa was not an arbitrator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This constitutional appeal did not say the effects of the annulment decision and as such, his Stampa's termination was already final and binding since a court decision on June 29, 2021, Azalina said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azalina said that the Spanish Constitutional Court had rejected the constitutional appeal filed by the Sulu claimants because they had withdrawn their claim to appoint an arbitrator following the annulment decision

                Describing it as another significant victory for Malaysia against the self-claimed heirs, Azalina said the Spanish Court's annulment of Stampa’s appointment as arbitrator is final and reaffirms Malaysia’s position on the arbitration case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On June 29, 2021, the High Court of Justice of Madrid (HCJM) issued a decision that annulled the judicial appointment of Stampa to act as an arbitrator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stampa was initially appointed arbitrator in 2019 by the HCJM without Malaysia being involved in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The self-claimed Sulu claimants recognised that Stampa was not an arbitrator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This constitutional appeal did not say the effects of the annulment decision and as such, his Stampa's termination was already final and binding since a court decision on June 29, 2021, Azalina said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azalina said that the Spanish Constitutional Court had rejected the constitutional appeal filed by the Sulu claimants because they had withdrawn their claim to appoint an arbitrator following the annulment decision
            </p>

                Chelsea just completed the priciest transfer in Premier League history, activating the $132m release clause in the contract of Liverpool 'target' Enzo Fernández
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool will hope that, like many other players near the top of the list (accessible via Transfermarkt), he struggles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If things go the other way, however, and Fernández establishes himself as one of the world's best at Chelsea, then it will be a source of ultimate regret for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the World Cup, where Fernández was instrumental in Argentina's triumph and won Young Player of the Tournament, a deal never felt likely
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Chelsea just completed the priciest transfer in Premier League history, activating the $132m release clause in the contract of Liverpool 'target' Enzo Fernández
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool will hope that, like many other players near the top of the list (accessible via Transfermarkt), he struggles

            <p>
                After the World Cup, where Fernández was instrumental in Argentina's triumph and won Young Player of the Tournament, a deal never felt likely

                Moving on, monetary policy meetings of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) could indirectly affect the Gold price via the US dollar and the market sentiment

                Even if the Gold price slip beneath the key support, a convergence of the Fibonacci 38.2% on one-day and 23.6% on one-week could challenge the metal’s further downside near $1,940

                Having been appointed by FSG in November 2016, he guided Liverpool through 11 transfer windows, signing the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Alisson Becker, Mohamed Salah and Fabinho to name but a few

            <p>
                The Reds will require significant investment into their engine room when the transfer window reopens in the summer, with Liverpool appearing desperately in need of quality and fresh legs in the middle of the park

                It will cost money to fix that problem, but it remains to be seen whether FSG has the same desire and financial power as Boehly does at Chelsea

            <p>
                “This method simultaneously addresses the congestion at KLIA, where until Jan 29, a total of 15,708 Long Term Pass Holder visitors have used this autogate facility.” Meanwhile, Khairul Dzaimee said QRT would also be assigned at the checkpoints in Johor Baru, namely the Sultan Iskandar and Sultan Abu Bakar Customs Immigration and Quarantine buildings.“A total of 40 personnel are currently undergoing training and will be divided into two groups of 20 personnel each for the two entry points

                As Europe battles a cost-of-living crisis, Britain’s umbrella labour organisation the Trades Union Congress (TUC) called it the “biggest day of strike action since 2011”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called for pay rises to be “reasonable” and affordable”, warning that big pay hikes would jeopardise attempts to tame inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Job centre worker and union representative, Graham, who preferred not to give his last name, said workers had no choice but to strike faced with soaring costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think we deserve a pay increase that keeps up with inflation.” Combative RMT union leader Mick Lynch, who has been representing many rail workers, told teachers who marched through London to parliament “every worker needs a pay rise, every worker needs a square deal..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked what Prime Minister Sunak was doing to resolve the strikes, his official spokesman said inflation remained the “biggest risk” to pay packets and that the government was ready to hold more talks with unions to avert further strike action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But he said ministers had to balance union demands with the need not to further fuel inflation and be fair to all taxpayers

                As Europe battles a cost-of-living crisis, Britain’s umbrella labour organisation the Trades Union Congress (TUC) called it the “biggest day of strike action since 2011”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called for pay rises to be “reasonable” and affordable”, warning that big pay hikes would jeopardise attempts to tame inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Job centre worker and union representative, Graham, who preferred not to give his last name, said workers had no choice but to strike faced with soaring costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think we deserve a pay increase that keeps up with inflation.” Combative RMT union leader Mick Lynch, who has been representing many rail workers, told teachers who marched through London to parliament “every worker needs a pay rise, every worker needs a square deal..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked what Prime Minister Sunak was doing to resolve the strikes, his official spokesman said inflation remained the “biggest risk” to pay packets and that the government was ready to hold more talks with unions to avert further strike action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But he said ministers had to balance union demands with the need not to further fuel inflation and be fair to all taxpayers

                'No one believed he was one of ours.' Enzo Fernandez joined Chelsea in a British record £107million transfer from Benfica Fernandez is the latest star arrival at Chelsea following a January of heavy spending by the club Even during his boyhood years in his home nation of Argentina Fernandez was in-demand There is a River Plate shirt signed by Fernandez proudly displayed on the club wall
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fernandez (red) has the ability to become Chelsea's newest midfield leader after joining from Benfica Fernandez won the World Cup with Argentina alongside national hero Lionel Messi in Qatar 'Make sure you shoot, you'll score,' Pablo Esquivel, who had discovered five-year-old Enzo at La Recova, told him in a text message on the eve of that Mexico game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Messi who played him in and Fernandez's goal made him the youngest player (21 years and 313 days) since Messi (18 years and 257 days) to score in a World Cup group game for his country
            </p>

                Fernandez can claim to have twice helped prevent Messi from retiring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By then Fernandez will be a year into life in west London and Chelsea will know if, as it was for La Recova, it is always worth doing whatever it takes to have him on your side.

                Working with a financial advisor can potentially help you maximize your savings and extend how long your money will last in retirement

            <p>
                Determining How Much You Have You may think that you have $1.5 million for retirement, but a closer inspection of your assets and income streams may make you realize you have more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taking a thorough inventory can help you determine not only how long $1.5 million will last, but how much you can reasonably spend each year.  Retirement Assets  In addition to your $1.5 million, you may have other assets that can be used to supplement your income at a later date or will be included in your estate for your heirs

            <p>
                Time is every investor's friend.  Here's how fast you would run out of money with each portfolio type, assuming you have a $1.5 million portfolio and withdrew $60,000 annually, taking out 3.8% more every year for inflation, which is the historical average annual inflation rate since 1960.  Cash Portfolio Withdrawing $60,000 annually from a $1.5 million portfolio kept in cash would cause you to run out of money in 18 years

            <p>
                Working with a financial advisor can help you determine the right way to invest your portfolio for long-term stability.  The Bottom Line How long $1.5 million will last in retirement depends foremost on how quickly you spend money

                Raphael Varane has announced his retirement from international football after France's failure to retain the World Cup in Qatar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Every time I wore that special blue jersey I felt an immense sense of pride, the duty to give everything, to play with my heart and to win every time we took the field
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I've been thinking about it for several months and I decided that it was the right time for me to retire from international football." The Manchester United defender has been key member of the French national team ever since making his international debut in 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Varane started every game at the 2018 World Cup as France lifted the trophy for the first time since 1998
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defender added that it was time for a "talented group of young players" to take on the mantle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He's an intelligent boy who knows how to take the time to think about it and weigh up the pros and cons before deciding," France coach Deschamps said

                Raphael Varane has announced his retirement from international football after France's failure to retain the World Cup in Qatar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Every time I wore that special blue jersey I felt an immense sense of pride, the duty to give everything, to play with my heart and to win every time we took the field
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I've been thinking about it for several months and I decided that it was the right time for me to retire from international football." The Manchester United defender has been key member of the French national team ever since making his international debut in 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Varane started every game at the 2018 World Cup as France lifted the trophy for the first time since 1998
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defender added that it was time for a "talented group of young players" to take on the mantle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He's an intelligent boy who knows how to take the time to think about it and weigh up the pros and cons before deciding," France coach Deschamps said

                The phenomenon, dubbed "Sushi Terrorism,” gained steam earlier this week after a teenager posted a video to social media filmed in Japan’s largest conveyor belt sushi chain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The video, taken in Gifu city quickly went viral on platforms including Twitter, sparking a wave of copycat incidents and sending shares in the restaurant’s parent company down 4.8% on Tuesday (Jan 31)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The conveyor belt sushi restaurant format "was not designed for the era when individuals can post videos on the internet,” said Citigroup Inc analyst Shuhei Oba in a note this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spokespeople for two other major conveyor belt sushi chains, Zensho Holdings Co.-owned Hamasushi and Kura Sushi Inc., told Bloomberg News they were considering methods like deploying artificial intelligence and cameras to deter potential pranksters

                The phenomenon, dubbed "Sushi Terrorism,” gained steam earlier this week after a teenager posted a video to social media filmed in Japan’s largest conveyor belt sushi chain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The video, taken in Gifu city quickly went viral on platforms including Twitter, sparking a wave of copycat incidents and sending shares in the restaurant’s parent company down 4.8% on Tuesday (Jan 31)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The conveyor belt sushi restaurant format "was not designed for the era when individuals can post videos on the internet,” said Citigroup Inc analyst Shuhei Oba in a note this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spokespeople for two other major conveyor belt sushi chains, Zensho Holdings Co.-owned Hamasushi and Kura Sushi Inc., told Bloomberg News they were considering methods like deploying artificial intelligence and cameras to deter potential pranksters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Officials fear it’s just the beginning Sushi conveyor belt pranks spark outrage in Japan

                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, in a statement, said that it includes suppression in several Israeli occupation prisons as well as collective punishments and reprisals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Malaysia calls on all right-minded world leaders to categorically denounce the outright killings of the Palestinians committed by the authorities of Israel," he said on Thursday (Feb 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said Malaysia also calls upon the international community to hold the Israeli regime to account for these crimes and demands the regime to immediately cease further acts of cruelty and barbarism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said that Malaysia continues to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine, and reaffirms its unwavering support for the Palestinians and their cause to achieve freedom from the illegal Israeli occupation and realise their aspirations for an independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as their capital

                Emilia Hanafi, 43, said that she chose to work part-time because she has to manage the schooling of her three sons, aged 17, 12 and 10, including dropping them off and fetching them from school
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seventh prosecution witness told the court that she took up a part-time job to support the family, including her three sons, for whom the interim maintenance of RM2,000 received for each child was insufficient

            <p>
                Emilia testified on Thursday after the court allowed the application of lawyer Datuk Akberdin Abdul Kader, who represents SM Faisal, for Emilia to be called to testify despite objection from the prosecution

                Thursday’s hearing was supposed to proceed with the sixth prosecution witness, Elisa Nani, who is Emilia's younger sister, to be cross-examined by the lawyer, but Akberdin applied for Emilia be called to testify first, because she is an important witness for the prosecution

                The court also rejected Hock Peng’s application to strike out the suit filed by the government through the LHDN

            <p>
                On March 24, 2021, the government as the plaintiff filed an application for a summary judgment to be entered against Hock Peng as the defendant in its suit to recover RM1,884,098,662.55 with interest at 5% per annum from the date of this judgment (Feb 1) to the date of full realisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The application was made on the grounds, among others, that the tax arrears and tax increases imposed under the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1967 can be recovered as a tax due and payable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hock Peng filed an application to strike out the suit on March 22, 2021, saying, among others, that the assessment years 2011 and 2012, as well as the additional assessments for 2013 and 2014, were invalid because they were made more than five years from the year of assessment on the income claimed to have accrued without complying with Section 91(3) of the Income Tax Act 1967
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Oct 18 last year, the Penang High Court allowed LHDN’s application for a summary judgment to recover RM1.05bil in tax arrears from Jho Low

                “The Spanish Constitutional Court has just rejected the extraordinary constitutional appeal (recurso de amparo) filed by a group of individuals styling themselves as the “heirs” of the Sultan of Sulu (“Claimants”) against the annulment of Mr Stampa’s appointment as arbitrator in the so-called Sulu dispute

                MANCHESTER UNITED secured the loan signing of Marcel Sabitzer on transfer deadline day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sabitzer, 28, was poached from Bayern Munich following the news that Christian Eriksen had been ruled out injured until May
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A box-to-box midfielder by trade, Sabitzer is most likely set to slot in as Eriksen’s direct replacement alongside Casemiro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That would allow United to keep their most tried-and-trusted shape under Ten Hag

                MANCHESTER UNITED secured the loan signing of Marcel Sabitzer on transfer deadline day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sabitzer, 28, was poached from Bayern Munich following the news that Christian Eriksen had been ruled out injured until May
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A box-to-box midfielder by trade, Sabitzer is most likely set to slot in as Eriksen’s direct replacement alongside Casemiro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That would allow United to keep their most tried-and-trusted shape under Ten Hag
