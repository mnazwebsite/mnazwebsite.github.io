                Liverpool could be in the market for a defensive player in the summer as Jürgen Klopp's staff look to steal a march on Premier League rivals for a 19-year-old talent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With this in mind, one would posit that Klopp's staff are already working in the background to ensure that Liverpool's squad remains future-proofed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Trent Alexander Arnold and youngster Calvin Ramsay possibly representing Liverpool's long-term options in the right full-back areas, it would perhaps make more sense for Mantilla to, therefore, be a long-term option for the Reds in the centre of defense
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With question marks currently surrounding Joel Matip's long-term future at Liverpool — he has less than 18 months left on his current contract — one would posit that it makes perfect sense that Jürgen Klopp's staff would be scouring the market for a successor

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! On top of this, Mantilla is intriguingly left-footed, with Transfermarkt claiming that he is also comfortable in the left-sided centre-back role
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, the 19-year-old's ability to potentially play a number of positions across the backline would surely make him an asset for the majority of clubs, including Liverpool

                The Blues' misery under Graham Potter continued on Saturday afternoon, as the Premier League's basement side Southampton won 1-0 at Stamford Bridge thanks to James Ward-Prowse's free kick
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Blues are also facing a last-16 exit from the Champions League following a 1-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund in Wednesday's first leg, with the German side set to visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg on March 7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Out-of-favour striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is also expected to be heading for the exit door at the end of the season, having recently been frozen out of the group under Potter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former Arsenal man was left out of the Blues' Champions League squad for the knockout stages and has also been cut from the ranks for each of their last three Premier League matches

            <p>
                © Reuters As is the case with Mount, Aubameyang's contract at Stamford Bridge only runs until 2024, and he has just three goals to show from 17 appearances at the club since arriving from Barcelona
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Hakim Ziyech, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Conor Gallagher are also viewed as expendable assets by Chelsea, who were on the verge of offloading the former to Paris Saint-Germain on loan in January

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Loftus-Cheek now has fewer than 18 months left on his Blues contract, and he has only played 79 minutes of Premier League football for Potter's side since the World Cup

                Marcus Rashford is rapidly closing in on the final year of his Manchester United contract with the Red Devils now having decided on a price tag in the event they are tempted to cash in on his services Manchester United are set to slap an eye-watering £120m price tag on star forward Marcus Rashford in a bid to fight off interest from a number of European rivals, it has been claimed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford has just a year-and-a-half remaining on his current deal at Old Trafford with concerns that he could move on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is suggested that United would only sell for a minimum of £120m - an amount that would make Rashford one of the most lucrative transfers of all time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the World Cup in Qatar, it was expected that United would only demand around £80m for the 25-year-old’s signature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regardless of who takes the reins at Old Trafford, it is thought that a new contract for Rashford is among the priorities

                Marcus Rashford is rapidly closing in on the final year of his Manchester United contract with the Red Devils now having decided on a price tag in the event they are tempted to cash in on his services Manchester United are set to slap an eye-watering £120m price tag on star forward Marcus Rashford in a bid to fight off interest from a number of European rivals, it has been claimed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford has just a year-and-a-half remaining on his current deal at Old Trafford with concerns that he could move on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is suggested that United would only sell for a minimum of £120m - an amount that would make Rashford one of the most lucrative transfers of all time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the World Cup in Qatar, it was expected that United would only demand around £80m for the 25-year-old’s signature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regardless of who takes the reins at Old Trafford, it is thought that a new contract for Rashford is among the priorities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The striker has been the side’s star performer this season

                Welcome to the ESPN Singapore Edition Mark Ogden believes Liverpool will secure a Champions League finish after their 2-0 win over Newcastle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez, 23, scored his first Premier League goal since before the World Cup to set Liverpool on course for a 2-0 win over Newcastle at St James' Park on Saturday -- a win which moves Jurgen Klopp's team up to eighth, six points behind fourth-placed Newcastle with a game in hand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Nunez has hurt his shoulder and he needs further assessment," Klopp said

            <p>
                "We don't know any more at the moment, we will have to see, but it is painful for him." Despite closing the gap on Newcastle to revive Liverpool's hopes of a top four finish, Klopp said it is too early to gauge whether his team have finally turned a corner this season

                Saturday, 18 Feb 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement posted on Facebook on Saturday (Feb 18), it said minister Hannah Yeoh, during her press conference on Feb 16, was only urging the private sector to emulate the government's paid internship policies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Feb 16, Yeoh responded to a question from Muar MP Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman during a press conference in Parliament, urging the government to implement paid internship programmes in the private sector
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syed Saddiq, who was present during the press conference, echoed Yeoh's proposal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During Syed Saddiq's tenure as youth and sports minister in 2019, the government had raised the allowances of paid internship in each federal ministry, government agencies and departments from RM300 to RM900
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead of compelling employers to pay internship allowance, he said the government should consider giving more incentives to employers to take in more interns and make it mandatory for all undergraduates to undergo internship
            </p>

                Saturday, 18 Feb 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement posted on Facebook on Saturday (Feb 18), it said minister Hannah Yeoh, during her press conference on Feb 16, was only urging the private sector to emulate the government's paid internship policies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Feb 16, Yeoh responded to a question from Muar MP Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman during a press conference in Parliament, urging the government to implement paid internship programmes in the private sector
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syed Saddiq, who was present during the press conference, echoed Yeoh's proposal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During Syed Saddiq's tenure as youth and sports minister in 2019, the government had raised the allowances of paid internship in each federal ministry, government agencies and departments from RM300 to RM900
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead of compelling employers to pay internship allowance, he said the government should consider giving more incentives to employers to take in more interns and make it mandatory for all undergraduates to undergo internship
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                Its minister, Hannah Yeoh (pic) said the move was taken to ensure the safety and needs of para athletes during their participation apart from ensuring the focus of the athlete is not affected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I have ordered the National Sports Council (MSN) to coordinate the requirement so that para athletes could devote full attention to perform their best at international-level championship,” she told reporters after a working visit to the Malaysia Paralympic Sports Excellence Centre here today

            <p>
                Hannah said the decision on the number of supporting officers for national para athletes is however subject to the participation quota stipulated by the organiser

            <p>
                According to her, MSN and Paralympic Council of Malaysia (PCM) will ensure knowledgeable officers in the specific sport be given the responsibility of escorting officers

            <p>

                Its minister, Hannah Yeoh (pic) said the move was taken to ensure the safety and needs of para athletes during their participation apart from ensuring the focus of the athlete is not affected

                “I have ordered the National Sports Council (MSN) to coordinate the requirement so that para athletes could devote full attention to perform their best at international-level championship,” she told reporters after a working visit to the Malaysia Paralympic Sports Excellence Centre here today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hannah said the decision on the number of supporting officers for national para athletes is however subject to the participation quota stipulated by the organiser

            <p>
                According to her, MSN and Paralympic Council of Malaysia (PCM) will ensure knowledgeable officers in the specific sport be given the responsibility of escorting officers

                SHAH ALAM Police here are tracking down five suspects believed to be involved in robbing a family of five using machetes in Taman Petaling, Klang on Friday (Feb 17) afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klang Selatan district police chief ACP Cha Hoong Fong said all the suspects who wore masks and gloves and are believed to have entered the two-storey terraced house through the rear door where they parked their vehicle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Several suspects also hit a 45-year-old female victim on her nose and body before knocking her on the head with the back of a machete,” he said in a statement today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Cha, the police received information about the getaway vehicle found in a residential alley in Taman Desawan, Klang, however, when the police arrived at the location, all the suspects had fled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The police are still tracking down the suspects involved, so those who have information about this incident are urged to contact Klang Selatan district police headquarters at 03-33762222 or any nearby police station," he added

                Local advocacy group Family Frontiers and the Malaysian chapter of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR Malaysia) were swift in commending the Cabinet for agreeing to amend the Federal Constitution so that children born abroad to Malaysian mothers can gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia has for decades been stuck with citizenship laws that were seen as unfair and discriminatory against women, as the Federal Constitution only granted automatic Malaysian citizenship to children born overseas to Malaysian men with foreign wives, but not Malaysian women with foreign husbands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Malaysian mothers were not able to fly back to Malaysia to give birth due to high-risk pregnancies or did not even know the government would reject Malaysian citizenship for their children just because they were born abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also the risk of Malaysian mothers' overseas-born children ending up stateless, such as in the case of Mashithah Abdul Halim whose youngest child is stateless or without citizenship from any country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Family Frontiers thanked the Cabinet and welcomed its decision to bring the proposed legal changes to Parliament to allow Malaysian mothers the right to confer citizenship on their overseas-born children on the same basis as Malaysian fathers, calling this a "significant step forward"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Family Frontiers president Suriani Kempe said the Malaysian mothers are awaiting for the Malaysian government to table the proposed changes to the Federal Constitution's citizenship laws

                Local advocacy group Family Frontiers and the Malaysian chapter of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR Malaysia) were swift in commending the Cabinet for agreeing to amend the Federal Constitution so that children born abroad to Malaysian mothers can gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia has for decades been stuck with citizenship laws that were seen as unfair and discriminatory against women, as the Federal Constitution only granted automatic Malaysian citizenship to children born overseas to Malaysian men with foreign wives, but not Malaysian women with foreign husbands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Malaysian mothers were not able to fly back to Malaysia to give birth due to high-risk pregnancies or did not even know the government would reject Malaysian citizenship for their children just because they were born abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also the risk of Malaysian mothers' overseas-born children ending up stateless, such as in the case of Mashithah Abdul Halim whose youngest child is stateless or without citizenship from any country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Family Frontiers thanked the Cabinet and welcomed its decision to bring the proposed legal changes to Parliament to allow Malaysian mothers the right to confer citizenship on their overseas-born children on the same basis as Malaysian fathers, calling this a "significant step forward"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Family Frontiers president Suriani Kempe said the Malaysian mothers are awaiting for the Malaysian government to table the proposed changes to the Federal Constitution's citizenship laws

                JOHOR BAHRU, 26 Mac -- Pengerusi Jawatankuasa Hal Ehwal Agama Islam negeri Johor Mohd Fared Mohd Khalid (Semerah) pada majlis mengangkat sumpah jawatan Ahli Majlis Mesyuarat Kerajaan Negeri Johor di Balai Menghadap, Istana Bukit Serene hari ini.

                State Islamic Religious Affairs Committee chairman Mohd Fared Mohd Khalid (pic) said a review needs to be done earlier in efforts to preserve the culture and prevent it from turning into activities that could affect religious beliefs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, a viral video on the TikTok application showed a ‘kuda kepang’ performance believed to have taken place in Johor which is believed to involve elements of worship and possession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Johor Fatwa Committee had issued a fatwa on Feb 18, 2000 making it illegal for Muslims to participate in Kuda Kepang performances as they contain elements of worship and possession

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb18 — Singapore has recorded its first Covid-19 vaccine-related death after the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced yesterday that a 28-year-old Bangladeshi man likely died due to a vaccination against the coronavirus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The coroner also found that on the balance of probabilities, it was “likely to be related to Covid-19 vaccination”, MOH said without naming the deceased
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the ministry’s Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme, a one-time financial aid of S$225,000 (RM 745,793.13) will be extended to the man’s family

            <p>
                It also said that to date, more than 17 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in Singapore through the national vaccination programme and this is “the first death related to Covid-19 vaccination locally”

                White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also said it was not the "right time" for Secretary of State Antony Blinken to travel to China after he postponed a Feb 5-6 trip over the balloon episode, but President Joe Biden wanted to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping when it was "appropriate."

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 18 — The Cabinet has agreed to amend the Federal Constitution to enable children born abroad to Malaysian mothers to gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Federal Constitution currently only provides automatic citizenship for children born overseas to Malaysian fathers, while Malaysian mothers are required to apply for their overseas-born children to be registered as Malaysian citizens with no guarantee of success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The only difference for such overseas-born children is whether their Malaysian parent is a father or mother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is despite an amendment to Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution in September 2001 to stop gender discrimination
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Six Malaysian mothers and advocacy group Family Frontiers on December 18, 2020 launched a legal challenge against the discrimination against women in the current citizenship laws in the Federal Constitution which were depriving their overseas-born children of automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian mothers and Family Frontiers on September 9, 2021 succeeded at the High Court which ruled that their overseas-born children are also entitled to Malaysian citizenship, but the Malaysian government on August 5, 2022 won its appeal in a 2-1 decision at the Court of Appeal

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb 18 — Google Singapore yesterday confirmed that it has laid off an unspecified number of employees at its Singapore office, a day after the global technology giant’s India office retrenched more than 450 staff members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In response to queries from TODAY, Google Singapore said that the firm is “unable to share the number of employees impacted in Singapore”, but said that the workers are “part of the 12,000 roles affected globally as previously announced”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google Singapore added yesterday that Google will “support employees in line with local practices as they look for their next opportunity”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Checks by TODAY on professional networking site LinkedIn showed that several laid-off and retained Google Singapore staff members had made mention of the retrenchment exercise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One claimed that the number of layoffs in Singapore was 190 employees but TODAY has not been able to verify that figure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Singapore Ministry of Manpower said last November that 1,270 workers were laid off in the Singapore tech sector between July and November last year

                About Us Advertise LONDON, Feb 18 — The US partner of global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has confirmed that a trading firm managed by Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng operated as a market maker on its platform
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters reported on Thursday, citing banking records and company messages, that Binance had secret access to a bank account belonging to its purportedly independent US partner and transferred large sums of money from the account to the trading firm, Merit Peak Ltd “While there was a market making firm named Merit Peak that operated on the Binance.US platform, it stopped all activity on the platform in 2021,” Binance.US said in a tweet on Thursday after the Reuters story was published
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The global Binance exchange is not licensed to operate in the United States but the transfers to Merit Peak revealed by Reuters suggest that Binance controlled the finances of Binance.US, despite saying publicly that the American entity is “fully independent” and operates as its “US partner.” Binance transferred over US$400 million from the account at California-based Silvergate Bank to Merit Peak between January and March of 2021, Reuters reported on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before that story’s publication, Binance.US had told Reuters that “Merit Peak is neither trading nor providing any kind of services on the Binance.US platform,” without giving further details
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A spokesperson for the global Binance exchange, which did not respond to Reuters’ questions for the story on Thursday, told crypto news outlet CoinDesk that the transfers were “a Binance.US issue.” Zhao, the Binance CEO, said yesterday that the global exchange has pulled back on potential investments in the United States, a move that comes amid growing scrutiny by US regulators of crypto companies so far this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They fell sharply on the Reuters report on Thursday, losing more than 22 per cent

                (Reuters) -     Lee Mason has left the referees' body PGMOL by mutual agreement after making a mistake as the Video Assistant Referee in last weekend's 1-1 Premier League draw between Arsenal and Brentford, Professional Game Match Officials Limited said on Friday

                A United States Air Force F-35 fighter jet taxis during the Aero India 2023 air show at Yelahanka air base in Bengaluru on Feb 13, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                India, desperate to modernise its largely Soviet-era fighter jet fleet to boost its air power, is concerned about Russian supply delays due to the Ukraine war and has faced pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The American delegation to the week-long Aero India show in Bengaluru, which ends on Friday (Feb 17), is the biggest in the 27-year history of the show and underlines the growing strategic relationship between the United States and India
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At previous editions of the show, Rosoboronexport had a more central position for its stall, although Russia has not brought a fighter jet to Bengaluru for a decade after India began considering more European and US fighter jets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The F-35 is not being considered by India "as of now", according to an Indian Air Force (IAF) source, but the display of two F-35s at Aero India for the first time was a sign of New Delhi's growing strategic importance to Washington
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked if it would be offered to India, Rear Admiral Michael L Baker, defence attache at the US embassy in India, said that New Delhi was in the "very early stages" of considering whether it wanted the plane

                Azalina pointed out that the Sulu heirs' bid to seize Malaysia's assets is based on the alleged arbitration award by Gonzalo Stampa --- whose appointment as arbitrator has been cancelled by the same court which appointed him initially
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                On January 24 this year, the District Court of Luxembourg decided to lift or set aside a seizure order on two Petronas subsidiaries and their assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seizure order was previously issued last July 11 upon request of the alleged Sulu heirs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 30, Azalina said Malaysia is also currently challenging an ex parte Exequatur Order — or a May 18, 2022 order which recognised Stampa's purported arbitration award in Luxembourg — before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia continues to dispute the appointment of Stampa as arbitrator and also challenges the entire arbitration process and his award in favour of the Sulu claimants as invalid and illegal

                On January 24 this year, the District Court of Luxembourg decided to lift or set aside a seizure order on two Petronas subsidiaries and their assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seizure order was previously issued last July 11 upon request of the alleged Sulu heirs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 30, Azalina said Malaysia is also currently challenging an ex parte Exequatur Order — or a May 18, 2022 order which recognised Stampa's purported arbitration award in Luxembourg — before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia continues to dispute the appointment of Stampa as arbitrator and also challenges the entire arbitration process and his award in favour of the Sulu claimants as invalid and illegal

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 — The Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) respects the decision of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) in not sending the national Under-23 (U-23) squad to the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China which is scheduled to take place in September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday, FAM president Datuk Hamidin Mohd Amin said the decision was made because the Asian Games was too close to the 2024 U-23 Asian Cup Qualifying Round scheduled to take place in the same month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2022 Asian Games is scheduled to run from Sept 23 to Oct 8 while the 2024 U-23 Asian Cup Qualifiers are expected to be held from Sept 4 to 12

                The Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) previously targeted the national squad to qualify for the semi-finals which promises an automatic qualifying slot for the 2023 Sudirman Cup in Suzhou, China, from May 14 to 21

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 — The Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) respects the decision of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) in not sending the national Under-23 (U-23) squad to the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China which is scheduled to take place in September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday, FAM president Datuk Hamidin Mohd Amin said the decision was made because the Asian Games was too close to the 2024 U-23 Asian Cup Qualifying Round scheduled to take place in the same month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2022 Asian Games is scheduled to run from Sept 23 to Oct 8 while the 2024 U-23 Asian Cup Qualifiers are expected to be held from Sept 4 to 12
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The top three teams in the 2024 U-23 Asian Cup finals will qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday’s defeat saw the national team settle for second place in Group B behind India
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) previously targeted the national squad to qualify for the semi-finals which promises an automatic qualifying slot for the 2023 Sudirman Cup in Suzhou, China, from May 14 to 21

                The judge questioned whether prosecutors’ proposal to largely ban Bankman-Fried’s internet use went far enough, citing the risk he could use his parents’ unmonitored devices
            </p>

                One of the prosecutors, Nicolas Roos, acknowledged that the government was not monitoring other devices in the home, but said having Bankman-Fried stay there was “a check against some other risks — risks that come from being unmonitored and by yourself.” The hearing came after prosecutors asked Kaplan to ban Bankman-Fried from using the internet except to review evidence against him or use email on his Gmail account, citing his use of a virtual private network (VPN) that could have let him hide some online activity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried’s communications became an issue when prosecutors said he sought to contact FTX’s current chief executive John Ray, and an in-house lawyer
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 — The proposal to make it compulsory to pay allowances to students who undergo industrial training in the private sector will discourage employers from offering places for internship, said the Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement today, MEF president Datuk Syed Hussain Syed Husman said instead of compelling employers to pay internship allowance, the government should consider giving more incentives to the employers to take in more interns and make it mandatory for all undergraduates to undergo internship

            <p>
                It is advisable for employers that take interns to pay some allowance to the interns, and employers taking in interns need to take into consideration rising costs of living faced by the interns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, private companies that take in interns to undergo industrial training pay allowances at their discretion, with the average allowance in bigger cities for an intern being about RM1,200, but some are paid less than RM1,000 per month

                Yeo said about four years ago, the then-Pakatan Harapan government imposed a pre-condition for Lynas' licence renewal to remove its radioactive waste from Malaysia according to its two letters of undertaking to the government in 2012
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "However, we refused to see a never-ending accumulation of radioactive waste in Malaysia hence replaced the condition on removing all radioactive waste from Malaysia with removing the radioactive material-producing process (cracking and leaching) from Malaysia within four years," she said in a statement Friday (Feb 17)

            <p>
                Under the new condition, Yeo said Lynas had four years to build a cracking and leaching facility elsewhere and upon its completion, Lynas would no longer be allowed to produce radioactive waste in Malaysia and only the intermediates would be allowed to be shipped here for further processing

                An older woman was barred from using the lift in a city council building due to her attire being policed by security guards in the building

            <p>
                Sin Chew Daily reported 60-year-old businesswoman surnamed Chen said that the security guards in the city council building denied her from using the elevator because of her dress that was deemed ‘too short’ despite the length falling way below her knees

            <p>
                As she proceeded to go to the lift, security guards blocked her path told the businesswoman that her dress length was considered too short and that the skirt length has to touch the floor to be considered appropriate attire for the building

                A Japanese justice ministry panel has proposed raising the country's age of consent, currently among the world's lowest at just 13, as part of a major overhaul of sex crime legislation

                Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway inexplicably sold most of its US$4.1 billion holding in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, a position only disclosed in November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sudden U-turn is uncharacteristic for the world's most-watched investor, whose bets on companies like Chinese electric-car maker BYD, have paid off handsomely after over a decade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For TSMC, Berkshire probably pocketed a 9% return, Reuters reported citing analyst estimates, having held the stake for roughly three months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Further perplexing investors, Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger declared that TSMC was the "strongest company on earth" at a meeting on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He may be right about TSMC, which boasts a monopoly in advanced chipmaking and superior profitability — the "moats" Buffett prizes so highly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moat or no moat, the outlook for chips is getting dicey.  We deliver news to your inbox daily Copyright © 1999-2023 The Edge Communications Sdn

                Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway inexplicably sold most of its US$4.1 billion holding in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, a position only disclosed in November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sudden U-turn is uncharacteristic for the world's most-watched investor, whose bets on companies like Chinese electric-car maker BYD, have paid off handsomely after over a decade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For TSMC, Berkshire probably pocketed a 9% return, Reuters reported citing analyst estimates, having held the stake for roughly three months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Further perplexing investors, Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger declared that TSMC was the "strongest company on earth" at a meeting on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He may be right about TSMC, which boasts a monopoly in advanced chipmaking and superior profitability — the "moats" Buffett prizes so highly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moat or no moat, the outlook for chips is getting dicey.  We deliver news to your inbox daily Copyright © 1999-2023 The Edge Communications Sdn

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 — Pejuang state assemblyman Harumaini Omar has reportedly denied that he was absent from the assembly sittings for six months, after he was thrown out and his Batang Kali seat declared vacant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Selangor state assembly Speaker Ng Suee Lim made the announcement that the Batang Kali seat is now vacant following Haruiman’s absence without leave for more than six months since July 28
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Ng, a by-election will not be called since Harumaini has been holding his seat for more than two years since his term begins in the 2018 Selangor state election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng said the declaration of Harumaini’s Batang Kali seat as vacant was done in accordance with Article LXIX of the 1959 Selangor state constitution, and that he would notify the Election Commission (EC) soon regarding the declaration of vacancy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malay Mail’s check of the Selangor state constitution’s Article LXIX shows the provision stating that the Selangor state assembly Speaker is to declare a state seat as vacant, if that state assemblyman has been absent for more than six months without the Speaker’s leave or permission in each sitting for a period of six months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Harumaini, who first won the Batang Kali state seat in the 2018 Selangor state election, was reported on August 15, 2020 to have quit Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia and expressed support for Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad who had at the time formed a new party called Parti Pejuang Tanah Air.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 — Pejuang state assemblyman Harumaini Omar has reportedly denied that he was absent from the assembly sittings for six months, after he was thrown out and his Batang Kali seat declared vacant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Selangor state assembly Speaker Ng Suee Lim made the announcement that the Batang Kali seat is now vacant following Haruiman’s absence without leave for more than six months since July 28
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Ng, a by-election will not be called since Harumaini has been holding his seat for more than two years since his term begins in the 2018 Selangor state election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng said the declaration of Harumaini’s Batang Kali seat as vacant was done in accordance with Article LXIX of the 1959 Selangor state constitution, and that he would notify the Election Commission (EC) soon regarding the declaration of vacancy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malay Mail’s check of the Selangor state constitution’s Article LXIX shows the provision stating that the Selangor state assembly Speaker is to declare a state seat as vacant, if that state assemblyman has been absent for more than six months without the Speaker’s leave or permission in each sitting for a period of six months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Harumaini, who first won the Batang Kali state seat in the 2018 Selangor state election, was reported on August 15, 2020 to have quit Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia and expressed support for Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad who had at the time formed a new party called Parti Pejuang Tanah Air.

                MEF president Datuk Dr Syed Hussain Syed Husman (pic) said instead of compelling employers to pay internship allowance, the government should consider giving more incentives to the employers to take in more interns and make it mandatory for all undergraduates to undergo internship

                KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Luxembourg court bailiffs issued fresh seizure orders for two units of Malaysian state oil firm Petronas (PETR.UL) this week, following a bid by descendants of a former sultanate to enforce a $15-billion award they had won against Malaysia, according to the heirs' lawyer and court documents seen by Reuters

                The judge questioned whether prosecutors’ proposal to largely ban Bankman-Fried’s internet use went far enough, citing the risk he could use his parents’ unmonitored devices
            </p>

                One of the prosecutors, Nicolas Roos, acknowledged that the government was not monitoring other devices in the home, but said having Bankman-Fried stay there was “a check against some other risks — risks that come from being unmonitored and by yourself.” The hearing came after prosecutors asked Kaplan to ban Bankman-Fried from using the internet except to review evidence against him or use email on his Gmail account, citing his use of a virtual private network (VPN) that could have let him hide some online activity

            <p>
                They also said Bankman-Fried’s recent use of a VPN was benign — to watch National Football League playoff games on a subscription he had bought while living in the Bahamas

                By Yasin Ebrahim   Investing.com -- The Dow closed lower Thursday as data pointing to underlying inflation pressures and a tight labor market stoked further fears about the Federal Reserve’s rate hike path at a time when some Fed members say a move back to bigger hikes isn't off the table.  The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, or 431 points, and the Nasdaq was down 1.8%

                Arsenal's midweek defeat to Man City has sent a clear message to owner Stan Kroenke about what must be done in the summer transfer window Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters Heading into Wednesday's clash with Man City, there was no doubt that Arsenal deserved to be where they were in the league table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The atmosphere was electric and Arsenal looked up for the challenge just as they have on numerous occasions this season, but Man City highlighted a reoccurring weakness which Stan Kroenke must address in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mikel Arteta's casualty list grew even further when Thomas Partey was ruled out against City after feeling discomfort in his back and it is not currently known when the Ghanaian will return
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Champions League football currently on course to return to the Emirates Stadium next season, the Arsenal hierarchy will know that the summer window has the potential to be one of their biggest - and most important - yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Wednesday, Arsenal had four defenders on the bench including Rob Holding, whose professionalism has been unquestionable since he joined in 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Arsenal want to do just that and reduce the gap on Man City even further, ambition must always be at the forefront of their plans moving forward

                Trent Alexander-Arnold hasn't provided many assists this season but the Liverpool right-back is still as important as ever
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Liverpool right-back was also unfortunate in an attacking sense
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Recently-shared data from Statsbomb highlights that Alexander-Arnold remains one of the top playmakers in the Premier League, regardless of assists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If nothing else, he is comfortably the leading Liverpool player for On-Ball Value (OBV)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Equally, for much of this season it has felt like Alexander-Arnold has not attacked as well, with the right hand side of Klopp's team not functioning as seamlessly as it once did
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whichever of them contributes the most when the Reds face Newcastle, Alexander-Arnold remains one of the most valuable on-ball playmakers England has to offer.

                Trent Alexander-Arnold hasn't provided many assists this season but the Liverpool right-back is still as important as ever
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Liverpool right-back was also unfortunate in an attacking sense
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Recently-shared data from Statsbomb highlights that Alexander-Arnold remains one of the top playmakers in the Premier League, regardless of assists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If nothing else, he is comfortably the leading Liverpool player for On-Ball Value (OBV)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Equally, for much of this season it has felt like Alexander-Arnold has not attacked as well, with the right hand side of Klopp's team not functioning as seamlessly as it once did
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whichever of them contributes the most when the Reds face Newcastle, Alexander-Arnold remains one of the most valuable on-ball playmakers England has to offer.

                Chelsea are in a complete mess right now as they suffered a defeat once again, this time losing to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Blues will have a great chance to redeem themselves this weekend when they take on Southampton – a team who are 20th on the Premier League table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Saints have also sacked their manager Nathan Jones earlier this week so this should an easy win for Potter’s men
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Saints have won just four games in the league this season so this match has come at the perfect time for Graham Potter and his men
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The manager has Cucurella as the other left-back option so Chilwell won’t be risked against Southampton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mason Mount is also an option for the manager in that role but we think he will stick with Madueke because he’s made a good impression down the right flank

                The Saints have also sacked their manager Nathan Jones earlier this week so this should an easy win for Potter’s men
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Saints have won just four games in the league this season so this match has come at the perfect time for Graham Potter and his men
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The manager has Cucurella as the other left-back option so Chilwell won’t be risked against Southampton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mason Mount is also an option for the manager in that role but we think he will stick with Madueke because he’s made a good impression down the right flank

                Lilly-Spells pointed to Dorsey's earlier decisions to shield from public view the results of police investigations, a 2010 confidentiality agreement between Ronaldo and Mayorga and allegedly stolen records of attorney-client discussions between Ronaldo and his lawyers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn Dorsey's dismissal last June of Mayorga's lawsuit, filed in September 2018 in state court and moved in January 2019 to federal court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They alleged that Stovall improperly used Mayorga to try to capitalize on Ronaldo's fame and fortune
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stovall argued that Mayorga, now 39, had learning disabilities as a child and was so pressured by Ronaldo's attorneys and representatives that she was in no condition to consent to dropping a criminal complaint she filed shortly after her encounter with Ronaldo and accepting the £311,156 ($375,000)

                Ronaldo's legal team does not dispute that Ronaldo met Mayorga and they had sex in June 2009 but maintained that it was consensual and not rape
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dorsey's ruling on Tuesday was notable for the amount of the penalty she imposed -- just £33,190 ($40,000) less than the amount Stovall has acknowledged that Mayorga received in 2010

                This is 27,196 units less than the all-time high monthly TIV of 76,657 units sold in December, or a 35.5% decrease in volume

            <p>
                The association said that the drop in numbers was due to the short working month as a result of Chinese New Year festive holidays, and also because certain makes were still affected by a shortage of microchips and components

                Compared to the same month in 2022, however, January’s total was 19.1% (or 7,928 units) higher than the 41,533 units achieved last year, where production cycles were still recovering from the disruption caused by floods that hit Shah Alam at the end of 2021

                THE Isuzu D-Max X-Terrain shocked the trucking world when it was introduced about two years ago

            <p>
                But the X-Terrain changed all that and proved that Isuzu knew how to make a pick-up truck that was at home both at the farm and in the urban jungle

            <p>
                The Isuzu D-Max X-Terrain was so well received that Isuzu Malaysia even sponsored the ultra-chic 2022 KL Fashion Week in a bid to position the D-Max X-Terrain as the pick-up truck of choice for those who wanted something that bridged both worlds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And for 2023, Isuzu is taking it further by introducing updated D-Max models including a new X-Terrain, one that will appeal to those who wanted just a little bit more from an already very capable pick-up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The exterior of the new X-Terrain is further distinguished by a new darkened front grille that also features fang like appendices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new X-Terrain also offers a new wireless charge pad with a 15W output that makes it great for a quick juice up while on the go

                They come with no contract as well with the exception of UNI5G Postpaid 89 which has a 24-month contract although this only applies if the customer chooses to pick up a 5G device together with the plan

                Prior to the revamp, Unifi Mobile customers are able to utilise unlimited data, voice calls, and SMS with 5G support via the Ultimate Plan which was priced at RM79 per month

                A funeral was held to lead Duangpetch Promthep's soul back to his home town in Chiang Rai’s Mae Sai district

                His body is still in England, but a funeral was held to lead his soul back to his hometown in Chiang Rai’s Mae Sai district, said Phra Kru Prayut Chetiyanukarn, the abbot who performed funeral rites using Dom’s photos, clothes and shoes

            <p>
                “On Tuesday morning, Duangpetch remained in critical condition before he died at 1.43pm (local time),” the embassy said, adding that its staff are working with the hospital, Brooke House College and Thailand’s non-profit Zico Foundation, which secured the scholarship for Dom, to return his body to Thailand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Along with his coach and football teammates, who were then aged between 11 and 16, Dom was stranded in Tham Luang cave for 18 days in June 2018

                About Us Advertise   SEPANG, Feb 16 — German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has arrived here to begin a three-day state visit to Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also present were Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Zambry Abdul Kadir and German Ambassador to Malaysia Dr Peter Blomeyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s Foreign Ministry said the visit would provide an excellent opportunity for Malaysia and Germany to further strengthen the longstanding relations and multifaceted cooperation between the two countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The last state visit to Malaysia by a German President was 26 years ago in April 1997
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Germany is Malaysia’s largest trading partner from the European Union (EU)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Steinmeier will attend a state welcoming ceremony at Parliament in Kuala Lumpur tomorrow morning and receive a courtesy call from Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya in the afternoon

                FSG announced in November they were prepared to sell their controlling stake in Liverpool and made the first significant move in ending their 13-year ownership of the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The full intentions of the ownership group have remained unclear, with FSG reportedly yet to receive any formal offers for either a minority or majority stake in the club

                And Broughton - who as chairman of the club sold the Reds to FSG in 2010 - revealed the ownership's objectives after he talked to current Liverpool and FSG chairman Tom Werner

            <p>
                If there is an offer that is a very high figure then we'd be daft not to look at it.' 'If there is an investor that wants to come, we'd certainly be willing to look at that and we wouldn't be at all surprised if we didn't get either and we continued to hold it

            <p>
                They have endured a hugely successful era under FSG but they said they were ready to sell up However, Broughton believes if FSG were to sell, they would be focused on finding the best interests of the club rather than just choosing the bid with the highest price

                The Auditor-General’s 2021 Report found Pharmaniaga Logistics supplied 93 defective ventilators to MOH during the pandemic, costing the government RM13 million in losses that couldn’t be claimed because there were no documents on the procurement done via CSR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On that day, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) approved emergency procurement for the ventilators, enabling the MOH to make advance payment of RM30 million to Pharmaniaga Logistics – identified in the Auditor-General’s report with its company registration number (260790-T) – for the procurement of 500 ventilators costing an estimated RM50 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An additional RM3.97 million approved for Pharmaniaga Logistics to upgrade certain ventilators pushed the cost of the overall procurement of 136 ventilators to RM24.07 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The national audit found that – based on a report by a Covid-19 Pandemic Emergency Procurement Monitoring and Administration Committee meeting on May 23, 2022 – only 28 of the 136 ventilators supplied by Pharmaniaga Logistics to MOH facilities were usable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The national audit found that Pharmaniaga Logistics returned RM6.97 million of the RM30 million advance payment for the ventilators to MOH on June 18, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because there were no documents on the appointment of Company 260790-T by the MOH.” MOH told the national audit in a response last October 7 that no agreement was signed with Pharmaniaga Logistics because the procurement of ventilators was done under emergency procurement protocols

                Ng, who chairs the Selangor water resource management special select committee, said legal discrepancies related to water pollution offences should also be given attention to avoid conflicting agency jurisdictions, especially in terms of the investigation that was currently happening in the field
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng suggested that offences related to water pollution should fall under only one Act, and similar laws in other acts should be repealed

            <p>
                She added that in Selangor, water pollution offences currently came under five laws, including the Water Industry Act 2006, Local Government Act 1967, Environmental Quality Act 1974, the Penal Code, and Selangor Water Management Authority Enactment 1999

                "In addition to increasing the fine in the Water Services Industry Act 2006, we suggest that the minimum fine should also be specified." She added that human resources within agencies, machinery and water infrastructure should also be improved

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 16 ― PropertyGuru Malaysia’s Sale Demand Index dropped 14.8 per cent in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2022, reflecting how potential buyers may still be facing affordability issues or a lack of confidence towards the current property prices on the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report showed an uptrend in PropertyGuru Malaysia’s Sale Price Index by 1.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) following the increased Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 2.75 per cent last year, contributing towards the higher overall cost of property ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the whole of 2022, the asking prices listed on PropertyGuru.com.my went up by 5.0 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the report also found that following rising property prices, potential homebuyers gravitated towards the rental market, seeing that the Rental Demand Index increased 32.9 per cent in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The supply of rental listings on PropertyGuru’s website increased by 19.6 per cent, as landlords were jumping back into a rental market with positive demand, seeking alternative income sources to offset inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Fernandez said as the Malaysian economy is expected to expand by 4.0 to 5.0 per cent in 2023, the property market is likely to remain active with positive growth

                According to the report, Felcra paid out RM478.6 million worth of dividends to participants in 2021, RM184.69 million in 2020, and RM137.76 million in 2019.  It did, however, note that its analysis found that only 49.3% to 79% of participants received dividend distributions in 2019, 2020 and 2021

                “According to Felcra, participants who did not receive dividend distributions were operating non-viable projects,” the report said, adding that as of Dec 11, 2021, there were 322 non-viable P&P projects out of a total of 1,198 projects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Further audit review of the company’s cash flow found that Felcra is able to pay the undistributed dividends,” it said, adding that based on the accounts as of Dec 31, 2021, Felcra had a cash balance of RM1.191 billion

                You would also have had to spend RM1,023 on petrol for these peak hour trips on your vehicle last year, with about one-fifth or RM221 due to traffic jams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In other words, because of traffic jams, Kuala Lumpur drivers would have spent an extra nine minutes more driving per 10km trip during the morning rush hour, and 12 minutes more during the evening rush hour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TomTom's calculations are based on the assumption of Kuala Lumpur drivers making a 10 km trip during the busiest hour in the morning and cover the same distance during the busiest hour in the evening, and totalled up over an assumed 230 working days per year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On weekdays, the busiest hour for driving in Kuala Lumpur's city centre in the morning would be the 8am to 9am slot (ranging from 18 minutes to 21 minutes), and the 6pm to 7pm slot in the evening (ranging from over 22 minutes to over 25 minutes)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TomTom's data showed that the worst rush hour in the week in Kuala Lumpur would typically fall on Thursdays during the 6pm to 7pm slot, where it would take 25 minutes 20 seconds on average to drive 10km in the city centre area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In comparison to Kuala Lumpur drivers spending 159 hours on the road in peak hours in the city centre last year, Singapore drivers would have spent slightly less time at 150 hours

                The company, which is set to list on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia on March 10, 2023, said the public issue will entail 173 million new shares at 90 sen per share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Post-IPO, Cape EMS is expected to have a market capitalisation of about RM830.7mil based on the enlarged share capital of 923 million shares and retail price of 90 sen per share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to non-independent managing director and group CEO Tee Kim Chin, Cape EMS started with providing EMS for industrial electronic products but has expanded its product portfolio to include both industrial and consumer electronic products such as wireless communication equipment, smart utility data collection equipment, point of sales terminals, household appliances and electronic cigarettes for both regional and overseas markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Our strong financial performance has provided us with the resources to continue to invest into our manufacturing facilities to be ready to capture more market share by taking on more orders for new products from existing and new customers in both the industrial and consumer electronic products segment," she said in a statement announcing the launch of the company's IPO prospectus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The projected growth of the global semiconductor and electronics markets will drive the demand for EMS, and we have set sights on the huge growth potential of both the local and global EMS industries." Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd is the principal adviser, joint bookrunner and joint underwriter of the IPO while AmInvestment Bank Bhd is the joint bookrunner and joint underwriter.

                "That is why the government has no plans to allow any more EPF withdrawals in the near future," said Ahmad at a press conference in Parliament on Thursday (Feb 16)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The figure consists of RM20.8bil by 5.3 million members under the i-Lestari programme, RM58.7bil by 6.6 million members under i-Sinar, RM21.4bil by 5.2 million members under i-Citra and RM44.6bil by 6.6 million members during an EPF special withdrawal programme last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad said the median savings in EPF accounts for all Malaysians stood at RM8,100 as of last year, which was a decrease of 50 percent from RM16,600 in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some 6.7 million members or 51.5 percent of 13.1 million EPF members, have savings of less than RM10,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2020, there were 4.7 million members with less than RM10,000 savings

            <p>
                The figure consists of RM20.8bil by 5.3 million members under the i-Lestari programme, RM58.7bil by 6.6 million members under i-Sinar, RM21.4bil by 5.2 million members under i-Citra and RM44.6bil by 6.6 million members during an EPF special withdrawal programme last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad said the median savings in EPF accounts for all Malaysians stood at RM8,100 as of last year, which was a decrease of 50 percent from RM16,600 in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some 6.7 million members or 51.5 percent of 13.1 million EPF members, have savings of less than RM10,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2020, there were 4.7 million members with less than RM10,000 savings
            </p>

                The first-generation Axia, based on the previous Ayla, had completely different styling, and the same goes for the latest Perodua Alza and Daihatsu Xenia

                Was expecting Daihatsu version with smaller headlamps compare to Perodua… well that is cost saving for both sides!!! Well … it but they charged us more! Too good for Malaysian,   DNGA AXN 1.0D-CVT is better value than the indonesian DNGA Daihatsu Ayla 1.0L, 1.2L will be more expensive at Indonesia too

                It is not difficult to do but you need the trust from Daihatsu

                The first-generation Axia, based on the previous Ayla, had completely different styling, and the same goes for the latest Perodua Alza and Daihatsu Xenia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s much the same story on the inside, as the Ayla shares the same dashboard layout with the Axia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I pernah guna axia long distance

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Was expecting Daihatsu version with smaller headlamps compare to Perodua… well that is cost saving for both sides!!! Well … it but they charged us more! Too good for Malaysian,   DNGA AXN 1.0D-CVT is better value than the indonesian DNGA Daihatsu Ayla 1.0L, 1.2L will be more expensive at Indonesia too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is not difficult to do but you need the trust from Daihatsu

            <p>
                Barcelona beat Manchester United in the 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals and their most recent tie was in 2019 at the quarter-final stage of that competition

                DRESS CODE IN LINE WITH RUKUN NEGARA Incidentally, the dress code at government premises – which is just a guideline and cannot be enforced as law – is in line with the fifth principle of the Rukun Negara, namely courtesy and morality, which is aimed at fostering unity among the people through good behaviour

                “People who don’t adhere to the dress code are mainly those ignorant of the rules,” he said, adding that lax enforcement in some premises can also give the impression to the public that the dress code is no longer applicable

                Earlier, Muhyiddin hit out at the government for what he claimed to be the political persecution of its leaders ahead of the six state elections later this year

            <p>
                However, he claimed there were moves by the government to pressure TikTok users who were also Perikatan supporters and that Perikatan leaders were blocked on TikTok.

                FFB said the proposals will pave the way for the group’s entry and ownership in one of the fastest growing artisanal ice creameries and the largest home-grown ice-cream chain in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between the financial years 2017 to 2021, the filing said TISSB group’s revenue grew from RM10 million to RM36.3 million, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%

                Post completion of the proposals, FFB said Edmund Tan and Lim will drive TISSB’s existing ice cream business, which will form part of the FFB Group’s ice cream division

                ‘Frenkie is an incredible player,’ said Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Frenkie de Jong has received extremely high praise from Man United manager ahead of Barcelona's Europa League clash with the Red Devils on Thursday Ten Hag wanted De Jong to join him in Manchester over the summer but the Dutch midfielder decided to stay at the LaLiga club So Ten Hag and De Jong will be on opposite sides at the Nou Camp, where the United manager will have to find a way of blunting a player who prospered under him at Ajax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘We had a class in 2019 that was a team with a lot of fascination,’ added Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United’s form is not too shabby, either
            </p>

                This season, talk of his future has been a distraction

                If Conte leaves, Tottenham will be back to square one

                Brighton have a slightly higher average of goals scored per game in the league this season than Tottenham

            <p>
                The next step in his development could be to step up to become the next Tottenham manager

                Premier League • England Tottenham Hotspur are already planning for who their next manager could be if Antonio Conte leaves at the end of the season – and the solution could come from within the Premier League

                Appointing him in the first place was not exactly easy for Tottenham

                This season, talk of his future has been a distraction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Conte leaves, Tottenham will be back to square one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Brighton have a slightly higher average of goals scored per game in the league this season than Tottenham

            <p>
                The next step in his development could be to step up to become the next Tottenham manager

Isn’t it stated in the general orders for civil service that any decision made, or actions taken in the civil service is to be for the good of the service and the public and not to prioritise the gains for any civil servant or any particular political party?

                Non-Malays simply do not apply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yeah, every non-Malay wants to work in Singapore, start billion-ringgit businesses, and stop playing football and hockey
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is clear that the hiring and promotion within the civil service, including enforcement agencies, are skewed racially
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many of my Malay friends in the late 80s received a spot in the civil service but I had to struggle to find a job
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So please don’t try to hoodwink the public and say PSC did not discriminate in their hiring process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No investigation done on this matter? Why was no action taken against those who commit this malpractice? Isn’t it stated in the general orders for civil service that any decision made, or actions taken in the civil service is to be for the good of the service and the public and not to prioritise the gains for any civil servant or any particular political party? The above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers

                England hope to wear the OneLove armband at the 2023 Women's World Cup, captain Leah Williamson said on Wednesday, as they aim to continue showing their support for the LGBTQ+ community

            <p>
                FIFA had made it clear the multi-coloured armband, introduced to support diversity and inclusion, was not welcome at the 2022 men's World Cup in Qatar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Williamson said England are determined to continue showing their support after wearing the armband throughout their triumphant run to the Euro 2022 title
            </p>

                China has also resumed scheduled passenger flights with 58 countries since its border reopening on Jan 8, state media CCTV quoted the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) as saying

                Last week, 98 domestic and foreign airlines operated a total of 795 international flights, up 65 per cent from the week before China abandoned quarantine for arrivals, CCTV reported

                China was the world's largest outbound tourism market before COVID-19 shut down global travel, with its overseas visitors spending US$255 billion in 2019

                Air passenger numbers during the Chinese New Year travel period from Jan 7 to Feb 15 rose 39 per cent from last year's holiday travel, CAAC said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A CAAC official said air transportation recovered rapidly in January, with strong demand between cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and the popular holiday destination of Sanya on Hainan Island during the Chinese New Year period.

                The range topper is the Mercedes-Maybach S680, which doesn’t have an official pricelist, but we are sure if your pockets are deep enough you can order one

                No 48V hybrid system here – powering the S680 is purely a 6.0 litre V12 engine making 621 hp and 1000 Nm of torque

                In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Supermax said the ongoing decline in glove average selling price (ASP) and rising per-unit production cost have resulted in the group recording financial losses for the first time

            <p>
                On the glove division’s prospects, Supermax said the rubber glove industry is transitioning into a rationalisation and consolidation phase and is expected to remain for some time after having experienced its strongest growth historically in 2020 and 2021 during the global Covid-19 pandemic

                In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, FFB said the acquisition represented 53.0 per cent of the enlarged issued shares in TISSB after the completion of the proposals, for a total purchase consideration of about RM68.4 million, subject to adjustments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FFB has also entered into share subscription agreement (SSA) with TISSB for the proposed subscription of 104,771 new TISSB shares, representing 12 per cent of the enlarged issued shares in TISSB for a total subscription consideration of about RM15.5 million based on the terms and conditions of the agreement

            <p>
                Upon completion of the proposals, FFB said TISSB will become its 65 per cent-owned subsidiary while the remaining 35 equity interest in TISSB will be held by Edmund Tan, one of the vendors
            </p>

                "Pursuant to the shareholders agreement, FFB will grant Tan the right to require FFB to purchase from him, upon the occurrence of any of the triggering events at any time during put option period, the remaining TISSB shares held by Tan," it said

                In a statement today, Anwar said the affirmation also showed the international rating agency’s confidence in the strength of Malaysia’s economic recovery as well as the country’s resilience amidst an uncertain and highly challenging global landscape
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Malaysia’s ratings balance a diversified economy with strong medium-term growth prospects against high public debt, a low revenue base relative to the operating expenditures,” said Anwar, citing Fitch’s statement released yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Fitch, Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to moderate to four per cent in 2023 and 4.8 per cent in 2024, from a strong growth of 8.7 per cent in 2022 amid easing of Covid-19 restrictions and as the government continues to provide relief measures and support towards rapid and broad recovery of the economy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moving forward, Anwar said the government is determined to ensure that the nation’s fiscal position continues to strengthen through gradual consolidation of the fiscal deficit, while balancing the need to support economic growth during these challenging times globally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Through Budget 2023, which will be tabled on February 24, 2023, the government will continue to intensify reform efforts to drive the country’s economic recovery, boost investment and improve public infrastructure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Anwar said Budget 2023 will focus on strengthening the country’s finances and governance, to support the government’s commitment to sustain the economic recovery momentum towards improving the people’s well-being, in line with the budget’s theme of “Building Malaysia Madani.” — Bernama

                According to Fitch, Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to moderate to four per cent in 2023 and 4.8 per cent in 2024, from a strong growth of 8.7 per cent in 2022 amid easing of Covid-19 restrictions and as the government continues to provide relief measures and support towards rapid and broad recovery of the economy

                CIJ executive director Wathshlah Naidu made the call in response to the Malaysian government’s decision not to charge human rights activist Heidy Quah under Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This decision, we hope, foretells the government’s commitment in not weaponising repressive laws to silence critics and curtail our freedom of expression and speech

            <p>
                Human rights activists, such as Heidy Quah, should not have been investigated and intimidated for speaking out and critiquing government action,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said Malaysia needs a government that lives up to the citizens’ hope for unrestricted freedom of expression and speech, especially when it comes to holding the government accountable

            <p>
                On April 25 last year, the Sessions Court agreed with Quah’s preliminary objection against the charge which was said to be defective, and granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The DNAA meant Quah was released from the charge but the prosecution can still decide to pursue the case against her in the future

            <p>
                Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor had previously said that the CCA would create a more inclusive environment for the oil and gas industry in Sabah including offshore and onshore, adding that it has been the state government’s aspiration that the state gets more from its oil and gas production

                The state government is pursuing more deals with PETRONAS which will be announced in due course.

            <p>
                Alexander-Arnold's low cross to Cody Gakpo for Liverpool's second goal on Monday doesn't technically count as an assist, simply because it grazed the knee of Vitalii Mykolenko on its way to the back post

            <p>
                After failing to assist a goal in any of his first 19 appearances this season, Alexander-Arnold has now set up three in his last seven matches (if indeed you count his pass for Gakpo on Monday night)

                The head coach of Spain's women's crisis-hit national team, Jorge Vilda, claims he has the best Spanish squad possible as he brands questions surrounding the revolt among his country's leading players as "disrespectful." Vilda has been at the centre of a storm which has engulfed the Spanish side since September last year when a cohort of leading players called for him to quit

                The head coach of Spain's women's crisis-hit national team, Jorge Vilda, claims he has the best Spanish squad possible as he brands questions surrounding the revolt among his country's leading players as "disrespectful." Vilda has been at the centre of a storm which has engulfed the Spanish side since September last year when a cohort of leading players called for him to quit

            <p>
                The Spanish coach on Wednesday, however, hit back at questions that he hadn't selected the strongest La Roja side possible

            <p>
                "I am asking for respect for my team," Vilda said through an interpreter

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Feb 15 — Nurul Izzah Anwar would “add value” to the special advisory panel to the finance minister, her father Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli said today amid fresh allegations of nepotism levelled at the new government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, who is also the prime minister, was again accused of nepotism after Nurul Izzah was invited to join the secretariat of the advisory panel, after giving up her previous role as a senior adviser to him on economics and finance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked if her spot on the advisory panel would still constitute nepotism, Rafizi said Nurul Izzah could help the secretariat “precipitate” with decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think there is added value (to Nurul Izzah sitting in the panel),” the minister said at a press conference here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                so there is added value (to Nurul Izzah’s involvement),” the minister added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Allegations of nepotism arose after Nurul Izzah disclosed that she had been appointed as a senior advisor of economics and finance to her father

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Feb 15 — Nurul Izzah Anwar would “add value” to the special advisory panel to the finance minister, her father Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli said today amid fresh allegations of nepotism levelled at the new government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, who is also the prime minister, was again accused of nepotism after Nurul Izzah was invited to join the secretariat of the advisory panel, after giving up her previous role as a senior adviser to him on economics and finance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked if her spot on the advisory panel would still constitute nepotism, Rafizi said Nurul Izzah could help the secretariat “precipitate” with decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think there is added value (to Nurul Izzah sitting in the panel),” the minister said at a press conference here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                so there is added value (to Nurul Izzah’s involvement),” the minister added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Allegations of nepotism arose after Nurul Izzah disclosed that she had been appointed as a senior advisor of economics and finance to her father

                China has repeatedly made it clear that the unintended entry of an unmanned Chinese airship into US airspace was an unexpected and isolated incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "China calls on Nato to cease its unwarranted accusations against the country," Wang said, urging the alliance to stop creating imaginary enemies and pushing its boundaries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In another development, Wang accused the US of "coercing and blackmailing" China by invoking the 1951 US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty, saying that this will in no way alter China's firm determination and strong will to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His comments came as the US issued a statement on Monday saying that it stood with the Philippines after Manila accused the China Coast Guard of using a laser against the crew of a Philippine Coast Guard ship in the South China Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The China Coast Guard ship acted "in a professional and restrained way", Wang said, adding that China and the Philippines have been in communication on the incident through diplomatic channels and the situation in the area is generally calm.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 15 — The trial of Lim Guan Eng for the Penang undersea tunnel project at the Sessions Court here has been suspended today so that the defence can get notes from a separate court proceeding that could exonerate the former chief minister of purportedly receiving RM2 million in bribes

            <p>
                Lim’s counsel Gobind Singh Deo told the court that the defence had filed an application to get the notes of proceedings from another Sessions Court in Shah Alam, Selangor on February 9 which was still pending

                International travellers who arrive in Thailand by air will be charged a tourism fee of 300 baht per person and 150 baht if they arrive by land or sea.  Tourists take photos on the beach at Maya Bay in Krabi province, southern Thailand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For travellers who arrive by land or sea, the fee is 150 baht per person, said the deputy spokesperson to the Prime Minister's Office Traisulee Traisoranakul after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday (Feb 14).  “The collected fee will be used to manage and develop tourism, which includes insurance for international tourists during their stay in Thailand,” said Ms Traisulee.  Travellers will be exempted from the tourism fee if they hold a diplomatic or official passport, or a work permit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Cabinet has also instructed the Immigration Bureau to review the visa rules, regulations and conditions as well as related immigration laws, in view of the new requirement to impose the tourism fee.  The changes should include proof of payment for the fee as part of the immigration process.  Citing a study by Thailand's ministry of tourism and sports, Ms Traisulee said Thailand is the first country in the world to collect a tourism fee and at the same time provide welfare benefits for tourists, including a personal accident insurance protection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She added that the money collected from the tourism fee will help reduce financial burdens on the Thai government, which spends about 300 million to 400 million baht per year in providing healthcare for tourists.  Other expenditures incurred by the government include the preservation of tourist attractions, the environment and natural resources that have been affected by tourism activities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tourism fee will come into effect no sooner than 90 days after it has been announced in the Royal Gazette
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thailand’s tourism industry, which is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, registered only about 430,000 tourist arrivals in 2021.  More than 11 million international tourist arrivals were recorded between January and December last year, after Thailand gradually lifted its COVID-related travel restrictions from 2021

                Liverpool's new sporting director may have a slight Mohamed Salah 'problem' he needs to address for Jürgen Klopp and he could do it with what could be an easy fix
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the sole right-winger at the club, especially since Sadio Mané's departure, Salah has had to play week in and week out essentially without much of a rest

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! That can be solved by signing a back-up option who can compete with Salah for the right-wing spot and also provide cover when Salah isn't 100 per cent match fit or needs a rest

            <p>
                But there's one player who could just be available for the right price who has been catching the eye on the right wing and who could definitely take Salah's place in the side first as a back-up and then as his heir in the future

                Hameediyah Restaurant manager Muhammad Salim Ahamed Seeni Pakir said it wanted to make its nasi kandar available primarily to the B40 community and hoped other consumers would act responsibly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We hope our customers will have empathy and know that this initiative is for the poor and needy,” he said, adding that the restaurant would not have a mechanism to stop anyone from buying its Menu Rahmah selections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Salim said this after the launch of Menu Rahmah at the restaurant, well known for its nasi kandar since its inception in 1907
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Menu Rahmah will be available at Hameediyah Restaurant outlets in Sungai Ara and Campbell Street starting from next month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We might offer Menu Rahmah selections at specific hours and those who come then can enjoy the reduced prices,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Hameediyah Restaurant manager Muhammad Salim Ahamed Seeni Pakir said it wanted to make its nasi kandar available primarily to the B40 community and hoped other consumers would act responsibly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We hope our customers will have empathy and know that this initiative is for the poor and needy,” he said, adding that the restaurant would not have a mechanism to stop anyone from buying its Menu Rahmah selections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Salim said this after the launch of Menu Rahmah at the restaurant, well known for its nasi kandar since its inception in 1907
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Menu Rahmah will be available at Hameediyah Restaurant outlets in Sungai Ara and Campbell Street starting from next month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We might offer Menu Rahmah selections at specific hours and those who come then can enjoy the reduced prices,” he said

                Liverpool could make the perfect transfer to 'complete' a trend started by Julian Ward, with one candidate primed to follow Darwin Núñez and Luis Díaz
            </p>

                There are some managers who like to work with a certain type of player, some who prefer a certain style of play and others who like to buy players from a certain league

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even with Ward moving on at the end of the season, the club should look to complete the set
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it's since Fernandes left Sporting CP that the next player Liverpool should be looking at has really started to thrive

                Liverpool could make the perfect transfer to 'complete' a trend started by Julian Ward, with one candidate primed to follow Darwin Núñez and Luis Díaz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are some managers who like to work with a certain type of player, some who prefer a certain style of play and others who like to buy players from a certain league
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When it comes to Julian Ward's time at Liverpool, that preference has tended to be for the Liga NOS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even with Ward moving on at the end of the season, the club should look to complete the set
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it's since Fernandes left Sporting CP that the next player Liverpool should be looking at has really started to thrive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He ticks a lot of boxes in terms of being the kind of midfielder Liverpool has lacked

                Of course, Gakpo showed signs last night that he can operate in a false nine role akin to what Firmino has for Liverpool but, given Klopp’s desire for his players to be comfortable in a variety of positions, this tweak to the Dutchman’s role doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility

                Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic has claimed Liverpool target Jude Bellingham will be ‘one of the best players’ of the next decade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking about the 19-year-old in an interview with The Telegraph, the BVB head coach lauded the midfield superstar, claiming he’s been an exceptional leader for him, despite his young age

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He’s not only 19; he is one of our leaders and he became a leader in the last two and a half years.” According to The Mirror, Dortmund value Bellingham at around £130m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although this is a huge amount to spend on one player, you can see why it can be potentially seen as good value
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic as the Reds’ number six, a partnership with Bellingham would be a dream prospect for Liverpool.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 15 — Several retailer groups and a tourism association today urged Tourism, Arts, and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing to reconsider a blanket ban that effectively stops tour operators from listing shopping as part of the itinerary

                The groups are the Malaysia Retailers Association; the Bumiputera Retailers Organisation; the Bukit Bintang-KLCC Tourism Association Kuala Lumpur; the Batu Road Retailers Association; the Malaysia Retail Chain Association; the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association; and a trade coalition of 123 businesses called Industries Unite

            <p>
                The groups said that they supported Tiong’s call for breaks in the tour itineraries but pointed out that shopping had been a major revenue source for Malaysia before the Covid-19 pandemic, contributing RM14.72 billion in 2019

                The PSC partners for the nine exploration blocks include Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB) and E&P Malaysia Venture Sdn Bhd (EPMV) for Block PM327; Skye UMDP Exploration Bhd and PCSB for Block PM340; PCSB, PTTEP Sarawak Oil Limited and Petroleum Sarawak EP (PSEP) for Block SK325; and Sarawak Shell Bhd, PCSB and PSEP for Block 3B

                "The first of the nine PSCs signed today also marks the 200th PSC awarded by Petronas since the maiden PSC signed in 1976,” senior vice president, Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM) at Petronas, Mohamed Firouz Asnan said in a statement today

            <p>

                A man, identified as Philip Mehrtens, the New Zealand pilot who is said to be held hostage by a pro-independence group, stands among the separatist fighters in Indonesia's Papua region, in this undated picture released on February 14, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pilot, Philip Mehrtens, who flew a plane operated by airline Susi Air, was abducted by fighters from the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) last week after landing in the remote region of Nduga
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the images, but a friend of Mehrtens, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, confirmed it was the pilot

                "The Papuan military that has taken me captive to fight for Papuan independence, they ask for the Indonesian military to go home to Indonesia and if not, I will remain captive for my life," Mehrtens said at one point in the video

                Indonesia's easternmost provinces have been wracked with a low-level battle for independence since the resource-rich region was controversially brought under Indonesian control in a vote overseen by the United Nations in 1969

            <p>
                The figure, the largest among the 20 provincial economies, was up 56.8 per cent from COVID-related spending in 2021 and more than double 2020's spending
            </p>

                In February 2021, statutory board Enterprise Singapore and the industry-led Singapore Standards Council issued guidelines for the proper handling, storing and processing of RTE raw fish.  The aim is to prevent bacterial and parasitic contamination and keep raw fish safe for consumption

            <p>
                Industry players are recommended to ensure that frozen RTE raw fish is received at specific temperatures, and to educate consumers on how to retain the quality and safety of raw fish after purchase, among other things

                The 2021 guidelines also suggest making RTE raw fish the last item to put in your shopping basket, and to keep it in an insulated bag after

                Instructions on the package on how to handle and store the RTE raw fish should be followed.  The fish should be placed in the chiller at temperatures between zero degrees Celsius and four degrees Celsius soon after purchase, added SFA.  When handling the fish, hands and utensils should be thoroughly washed before and after to prevent cross-contamination.  And if it's not obvious enough - do not consume expired RTE raw fish.  "Consumers who choose to eat RTE raw fish must be aware of the risks involved," said SFA

            <p>
                The man, identified by his surname Zhou, bought the ticket in 2021 and won a prize money of 10 million yuan (RM6.4 million), Oddity Central reported

            <p>
                On the day the money was credited into his account, Zhou transferred two million yuan (RM1.3 million) to his sister and another 700,000 yuan (RM448,549) to his ex-wife so she could buy an apartment
            </p>

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Feb 15 — Nurul Izzah Anwar would “add value” to the special advisory panel to the finance minister, her father Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli said today amid fresh allegations of nepotism levelled at the new government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, who is also the prime minister, was again accused of nepotism after Nurul Izzah was invited to join the secretariat of the advisory panel, after giving up her previous role as a senior adviser to him on economics and finance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked if her spot on the advisory panel would still constitute nepotism, Rafizi said Nurul Izzah could help the secretariat “precipitate” with decisions
            </p>

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Feb 15 — Nurul Izzah Anwar would “add value” to the special advisory panel to the finance minister, her father Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli said today amid fresh allegations of nepotism levelled at the new government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, who is also the prime minister, was again accused of nepotism after Nurul Izzah was invited to join the secretariat of the advisory panel, after giving up her previous role as a senior adviser to him on economics and finance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked if her spot on the advisory panel would still constitute nepotism, Rafizi said Nurul Izzah could help the secretariat “precipitate” with decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think there is added value (to Nurul Izzah sitting in the panel),” the minister said at a press conference here

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It would be better (if) our economic growth exceeds 5% within two- to three years; the aspiration of reaching high-income country status will be sooner,” he said at a press conference on Malaysia’s economic performance and gross domestic product (GDP) growth 2022 here on Wednesday (Feb 15)

                Earlier, regarding the economic performance of 2022, Rafizi said Malaysia’s performance in recording an annual GDP growth of 8.7% is encouraging and reflects on the country’s economic resilience

            <p>

                “In a situation whereby global economic growth is expected to be slower in 2023 and quarterly growth has been slow for four consecutive quarters in 2022, the government would need to prepare for a more challenging economic environment,” Rafizi said

            <p>
                The minister added that economic programmes that focus on the two main factors of the people’s economy, namely the cost of living and income, will be given the main focus in economic planning

                “It means that if economic growth from 2023 to 2025 is around 4% to 5% and performing well, we can reach the status of a high-income nation as early as 2026
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It would be better (if) our economic growth exceeds 5% within two- to three years; the aspiration of reaching high-income country status will be sooner,” he said at a press conference on Malaysia’s economic performance and gross domestic product (GDP) growth 2022 here on Wednesday (Feb 15)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, regarding the economic performance of 2022, Rafizi said Malaysia’s performance in recording an annual GDP growth of 8.7% is encouraging and reflects on the country’s economic resilience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The global economic environment which is expected to moderate and grow at a slower rate of 2.9% in 2023, compared to 3.4% for 2022, will likely affect the country’s economic performance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In a situation whereby global economic growth is expected to be slower in 2023 and quarterly growth has been slow for four consecutive quarters in 2022, the government would need to prepare for a more challenging economic environment,” Rafizi said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The minister added that economic programmes that focus on the two main factors of the people’s economy, namely the cost of living and income, will be given the main focus in economic planning

                Singapore’s Straits Times reports that a psychiatric patient in Selayang Hospital – upset about being stranded in the emergency room along with dozens of others as all wards were full – stabbed another patient earlier today, causing serious injuries

                KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 14 – A patient was seriously injured after getting stabbed by a psychiatric patient today in Selayang Hospital, as the latter was allegedly upset at being stranded in the overcrowded emergency department

            <p>
                Singapore’s The Straits Times reported that all the wards at the public hospital in Selangor were full at the time of the incident and that dozens were waiting in the emergency room

            <p>
                Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, in a tweet, confirmed the stabbing incident, saying that the psychiatric patient had been brought in to Selayang Hospital by the police

            <p>
                One of the doctors interviewed by CodeBlue said that patients are stranded in the emergency department of Selayang Hospital, a tertiary Ministry of Health (MOH) hospital, for between 24 and 72 hours

            <p>
                CodeBlue’s nationwide survey last month among more than 1,600 health care workers in the government health service – which is reportedly suffering from dire staff shortages – showed that 95 per cent believe that the public health care system is currently in crisis

                Johor Chief Minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi and Singapore Transport Minister S Iswaran, who is also the country's Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, meeting during Mr Onn Hafiz's three-day visit to Singapore on Feb 14, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said at that time that the terminal is a key international entry point that increases access for tourists to come to Johor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Onn Hafiz said that last year, more than 141,000 tourists came from Batam and Tanjung Balai in Indonesia to Puteri terminal via ferry services owned and operated by Malaysia property developer UEM Sunrise.  Mr Onn Hafiz on Tuesday also shared other points of discussions between him and Mr Iswaran.  He said both of them agreed that the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link was a priority for both countries.  “I agree with his suggestion to closely monitor the project's development, and to set short term and medium term goals so that the project continues to be on track,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  The cross-border rail project aims to connect Bukit Chagar in Johor Bahru city to Woodlands in Singapore, serving about 10,000 passengers per hour each way to help ease traffic congestion on the Causeway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is scheduled to be operational by end-2026.  Mr Onn Hafiz also reiterated a commitment he said was made recently by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to increase motorcycle lanes at the immigration complex in Bangunan Sultan Iskandar, which is linked to the Woodlands Causeway.  “It is generally known that the Johor-Singapore Causeway is one of the busiest land crossings in the world, with more than 300,000 Malaysians commuting daily from Johor Bahru to work in Singapore,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  The Machap state assemblyman added that he shared Mr Anwar’s willingness to see through a proposal to widen the lanes of the Johor portion of the North-South Highway.  “If this proposal is implemented, for sure it will benefit the business community in Singapore who wish to invest in Malaysia,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  “I once again express the willingness of the Johor State Government to foster future collaborations between Johor-Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This close ties is significant for both parties,” he added.  Tuesday was the last day of Mr Onn Hafiz’s three-day working visit to Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides Mr Iswaran, he also met with other Singapore leaders like Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan as well as Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman.  The chief minister also held meetings with business leaders as well as foreign corporations based in Singapore.  He said in a statement on Sunday that these companies were potential investors that could rake in between RM10 to RM15 billion (US$2.3 to US$3.45 billion) for the southern state and bring high paying jobs for Johoreans.  “The state government, with the help of the federal government, is committed to be facilitators and prepare utilities and infrastructure, to ensure a friendly business environment for investors across the world,” he added.

                Anthony Loke said that road users looking to register for a digital road tax would soon have to input the unique code located behind their driving licence in addition to their IC number during registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that he has discussed this thoroughly with JPJ and the system update will likely roll out soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said the new registration requirement would only apply to those that have yet to register through the JPJ app or website and that existing users would not be required to comply with the new requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the digitalisation of road tax would remain voluntary and there would be no mandate yet on forcing all road users to register into the system

                Anthony Loke said that road users looking to register for a digital road tax would soon have to input the unique code located behind their driving licence in addition to their IC number during registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that he has discussed this thoroughly with JPJ and the system update will likely roll out soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said the new registration requirement would only apply to those that have yet to register through the JPJ app or website and that existing users would not be required to comply with the new requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the digitalisation of road tax would remain voluntary and there would be no mandate yet on forcing all road users to register into the system

            <p>
                He added that the state hopes to create between 300 and 500 aeronautical space companies that can provide up to 5,000 jobs, including 90 highly paid positions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A series of discussions have already been conducted between the state and Sovereign Sengalang, the company undertaking the feasibility study
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arifin, who took over the state ministry from Datuk Yakub Khan earlier this year, also spoke its plans for the state which include upgrading the state’s internet coverage and building more science centres to increase knowledge and awareness for the science and technology sector.

                Puteri Sarah filed for leave to initiate committal proceedings against Ira, whose full name is Faghira Fatini, her sister Yasmin, and Kazaruddin over an alleged breach of a court injunction following the revelation of Ira's marriage to Puteri Sarah's husband, actor and director Syamsul Yusof, last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the leave application filed on Jan 31, Puteri Sarah, whose full name is Puteri Sarah Liyana Megat Kamaruddin, claimed that the three defendants had committed contempt of court when they voluntarily violated an inter-parte injunction order dated July 4 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The injunction order was part of a lawsuit filed by Puteri Sarah in June, after she claimed she was on the receiving end of a barrage of harassment and threats from Ira, 27, via social media

                Puteri Sarah also stated that she and her children no longer lived with Syamsul, either at her in-laws’ house or at their matrimonial home in Taman Melawati

                Loan repayments also only begin 12 months after the borrowers have completed their higher studies to give them time to earn a stable income,” said Khaled To an additional question whether the government has promised to introduce the targeted abolition since it was previously listed as part of the election manifesto, Khaled said one of the parties under the Unity Government had decided to totally abolish PTPTN loan repayments

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 14 — Malaysia is taking steps to strengthen its position through various policy measures, leveraging the existing electric vehicles (EV) ecosystem and ensuring a solid talent pipeline to help the development of the EV industry in Malaysia, said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said Malaysia is seriously looking into policies that will support energy sectors to ensure that the EV ecosystem is complete and fully supported, including standards, certification and verification related to charging systems and battery disposal activities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To capitalise on the EV market, Tengku Zafrul said the government will also strengthen Malaysia’s Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the government has made a firm commitment to strategically develop the automotive industry, particularly the EV industry, as part of the zero greenhouse gas (GHG) target by 2050
