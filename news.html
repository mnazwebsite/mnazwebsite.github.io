                Judge Rozina Ayob announced the decision after finding that the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case against company director Gulam Rusol Md Ismail, 60, and CFO Kamaruzzaman Kamaludeen, 50
            </p>

                "The prosecution failed to state specifically what the false details were that are said to have deceived the ministry, and that is a defect that has been detrimental to the prosecutions case and is prejudicial against both of the accused," she said, adding that the court found that when the audit team was present at Natureceuticals Sdn Bhd (NCSB), the machines were not there as the cancellation of purchase was made by the 12th prosecution witness, then-NCSB director Dr Amin Malik Shah Abdul Majid, and not both of the accused
            </p>

                A total of 15 witnesses were called by the prosecution to testify at the trial that began on Jan 28, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution was led by Deputy Public Prosecutors Raya Rasyidah Murni Azmi and Natrah Fareha Rahmat, while lawyer Wan Azwan Aiman Wan Fakhruddin represented Gulam Rusol and lawyer Muhammad Irzan Iswatt Noor Mohd was Kamaruzzaman's counsel

            <p>
                Gulam Rusol and Kamaruzzaman were charged under Section 18 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009

                Judge Rozina Ayob announced the decision after finding that the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case against company director Gulam Rusol Md Ismail, 60, and CFO Kamaruzzaman Kamaludeen, 50
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The prosecution failed to state specifically what the false details were that are said to have deceived the ministry, and that is a defect that has been detrimental to the prosecutions case and is prejudicial against both of the accused," she said, adding that the court found that when the audit team was present at Natureceuticals Sdn Bhd (NCSB), the machines were not there as the cancellation of purchase was made by the 12th prosecution witness, then-NCSB director Dr Amin Malik Shah Abdul Majid, and not both of the accused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A total of 15 witnesses were called by the prosecution to testify at the trial that began on Jan 28, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution was led by Deputy Public Prosecutors Raya Rasyidah Murni Azmi and Natrah Fareha Rahmat, while lawyer Wan Azwan Aiman Wan Fakhruddin represented Gulam Rusol and lawyer Muhammad Irzan Iswatt Noor Mohd was Kamaruzzaman's counsel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gulam Rusol and Kamaruzzaman were charged under Section 18 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009

                Meanwhile, the Malaysian Film Producers Association (PFM) has issued a reprimand directed at local film producers and is asking them to be more sensitive to content development especially when dealing with religious issues, race and culture in the country even with subtle attempts as depicted in the film Mentega Terbang

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 ― Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim is suing Pendang Member of Parliament Datuk Awang Solahuddin Hashim over the latter’s defamatory remarks of the prime minister at the Parliament lobby last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, 75, filed the suit through Messrs SN Nair & Partners at the High Court here around noon today and named Awang Solahuddin as the sole defendant

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 — Former MCA president Tan Sri Lee San Choon has passed away at the age of 87
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former fourth president of MCA was hailed as a legendary politician for leading his party through three general elections, with the most successful being the 1982 general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to the 1982 general election, he accepted former DAP’s secretary-general Lim Kit Siang's challenge to contest in a Chinese-majority constituency and won against the former DAP’s chairman Chen Man Hin in his Seremban stronghold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He started off his political career by joining MCA in 1957 and went on to win the Klang Utara parliamentary seat in the 1959 general election and became the youngest MP in the country at the age of 24
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lee dramatically retired from politics at the height of his political career by resigning from the Cabinet on March 24, 1983 and relinquishing his position as the president of MCA the next day for unspecified reasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former statesman however explained in 2000 to Asiaweek that he was "stabbed in the back” by Umno leaders in the 1982 election.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 — Former MCA president Tan Sri Lee San Choon has passed away at the age of 87
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former fourth president of MCA was hailed as a legendary politician for leading his party through three general elections, with the most successful being the 1982 general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to the 1982 general election, he accepted former DAP’s secretary-general Lim Kit Siang's challenge to contest in a Chinese-majority constituency and won against the former DAP’s chairman Chen Man Hin in his Seremban stronghold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He started off his political career by joining MCA in 1957 and went on to win the Klang Utara parliamentary seat in the 1959 general election and became the youngest MP in the country at the age of 24
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lee dramatically retired from politics at the height of his political career by resigning from the Cabinet on March 24, 1983 and relinquishing his position as the president of MCA the next day for unspecified reasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former statesman however explained in 2000 to Asiaweek that he was "stabbed in the back” by Umno leaders in the 1982 election.

                Man United defeated West Ham United 3-1 in the fifth round of the FA Cup at Old Trafford on Wednesday evening

                Lee Suet Fern acted with complete disregard for Lee Kuan Yew’s interests While Thomas claims in the e-book that Suet Fern made an “innocent mistake” in sending Lee Kuan Yew a different version of the will, the tribunal and the court found that she had acted with complete disregard for his interests

                Lee Hsien Yang’s act of cutting out Kwa Kim Li from communications with Lee Kuan Yew on the last will was disturbing and troubling Thomas suggests in the e-book that there was no “shady behaviour” when Lee Hsien Yang excluded Kwa in communications with his father

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lee Kuan Yew did not have discussions with Kwa Kim Li about reinserting a demolition clause into the last will, and was not advised by Lee Suet Fern on the reinsertion Thomas said in the e-book that the last will was based on the late Lee’s orders and suggested that he had made a conscious decision to include the demolition clause

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, March 3 — Transport operator SMRT has made a police report in the wake of a viral video which appears to show someone jamming open a platform screen door at an MRT station, preventing it from closing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Responding to TODAY’s queries, president of SMRT Trains Lam Sheau Kai said yesterday that on February 28 at about 5pm, a commuter on the east-bound station platform at Jurong East MRT station “deliberately prevented a platform screen door from closing”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The person appears to block the platform screen door from closing with what sounds like a metal object, causing a delay to the train moving off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The person then claims that the video will be uploaded to YouTube, before retracting the claim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I’m going to go far away so I’m not too much of a suspect,” says the voice behind the camera, backing off from the train door
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After about a minute’s delay, an SMRT staff runs over to the affected platform door, appearing to fix the issue caused
            </p>

                It is only after this that the train moves off

                Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said during a visit to the Philippines that Asean must prove it is "relevant" in helping to resolve the crisis in Myanmar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a pre-recorded interview with Philippine news channel ANC aired on Friday, Anwar said that Asean, which is leading diplomatic efforts to bring peace, needed to be more assertive and noted that his country was shouldering 200,000 displaced people from Myanmar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We can't see this as a purely internal issue, so I have appealed to friends in Asean to say, look we have to be tougher," Anwar said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If necessary engage with the armed forces of this country because sometimes the military junta does not understand the civilian narrative." Myanmar has been beset by social, political and economic chaos since its military overthrew an elected government in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the 10-member bloc has barred Myanmar's generals from attending its high-level meetings, Malaysia, a vocal critic of the junta, has called for tougher action

                It's a strategy Liverpool should look to follow given FSG don't always have the financial resources to compete with the club's far wealthier rivals, and a league like the J.League could be an excellent place for investment for the Reds

                One Liverpool should keep an eye on is Mao Hosoya, who was voted the Best Young Player of the Year in the J.League in 2022, and who has started this season with two goals in two games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hosoya, who is 21, made 12 goal contributions in the league last season, and he is looking likely to better than this season after an impressive start

                Liverpool should be looking at emulating a recent Brighton transfer strategy in order to make a transfer for an exciting young player with an expiring contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's a strategy Liverpool should look to follow given FSG don't always have the financial resources to compete with the club's far wealthier rivals, and a league like the J.League could be an excellent place for investment for the Reds

                One Liverpool should keep an eye on is Mao Hosoya, who was voted the Best Young Player of the Year in the J.League in 2022, and who has started this season with two goals in two games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hosoya, who is 21, made 12 goal contributions in the league last season, and he is looking likely to better than this season after an impressive start

                Manchester United have won the Carabao Cup and they are still in contention to add the FA Cup, Europa League and Premier League to their trophy cabinet this season Manchester United are on a roll under Erik ten Hag – and their success could see them rake in huge amounts through generous bonuses in the coming months

                United probably don’t need any more motivation to add to their trophy haul, but the Daily Mail reports that the players could take home £485,000 each in bonuses if they add the Premier League, Europa League and FA Cup to the Carabao Cup by the end of the season

                Victory in the FA Cup and Europa League is reportedly worth £85,000 each to the players, while the Premier League would net them a staggering £250,000

                Liverpool could be accused of not having enough street-smarts at times this season, but Jürgen Klopp may have just seen a transfer solution bred in futsal

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite a recent resurgence in the Premier League, it is expected that Liverpool will enter the transfer market in the summer for some reinforcements at center-back, with Joe Gomez and Joël Matip having been inconsistent this season, and with the latter having entered the final 18 months of his current deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Kilman has supposedly emerged as the potential bargain transfer solution for Liverpool, with Tottenham also said to be interested in the 25-year-old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only does the Wolves defender boast extensive Premier League experience, with 77 top-flight appearances to his name, but he is also a senior home-grown player, which is something that may prove attractive depending on Liverpool's outgoings this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When one looks closer at Kilman's numbers, it is clear why both Liverpool and Spurs are rumored to have designs on signing the 6"4 defender who has been an ever-present for Wolves this season, and who played 31 times in the league last year

                “This means that an RM100,000 loan at 2% interest, for example, would increase an EPF contributor’s savings by RM4,000 due to the compounding effect, provided the dividend payout is 6% per annum, from which 2% will be deducted by EPF as loan interest.” Barjoyai said the government is aware that most individuals in the lower-income group want to make another EPF withdrawal, but that would deplete their savings and they would have nothing in their old age

                Barjoyai added that salaries in Malaysia were very low, and he concurred with Mohideen that one of the reasons for the situation is low productivity

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A better method would be to get EPF to provide these contributors with loans they cannot withdraw and at low-interest rates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This means that an RM100,000 loan at 2% interest, for example, would increase an EPF contributor’s savings by RM4,000 due to the compounding effect, provided the dividend payout is 6% per annum, from which 2% will be deducted by EPF as loan interest.” Barjoyai said the government is aware that most individuals in the lower-income group want to make another EPF withdrawal, but that would deplete their savings and they would have nothing in their old age
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barjoyai added that salaries in Malaysia were very low, and he concurred with Mohideen that one of the reasons for the situation is low productivity

                The new visa system put in place after Brexit is a contributory factor to Premier League clubs spending record sums on transfer fees as they find it more difficult to sign players at a younger age, the league's chief executive Richard Masters said on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A UEFA report published last month showed the January transfer window was dominated by English clubs who spent a total of €830 million ($878m) which accounted for 53% of global transfer spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That's certainly not the only reason why lots of money and records are being broken in the Premier League transfer window, but it's a contributing factor." The UK Home Office has a points-based Government Body Endorsement (GBE) system based on which clubs must apply to England's Football Association to sign players
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Some of this has nothing to do with the GBE system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's just that if you're outside Europe, we can't buy younger players in the same way that you could before, but it's partially to do with the GBE system." Chelsea were the biggest spenders having laid out more than £500m ($596m) in two windows since an investment group led by American Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took over the club in May last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I'm not here to defend the new owners who have owned the club for less than a year and had two transfer windows," Masters said

                Newcastle's takeover by a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was rubber-stamped in October 2021 after "legally binding assurances" that the Saudi government would have no control of the north-east club

                While the average five-year CD rate is 1.18%, savers can get an APY of 4.39% from First Internet Bank and even 4.50% from BMO Harris for accounts with a balance of as little as $1,000

                Interest rate volatility has made things even better when it comes to one-year CDs

            <p>
                As a result, savers can get three-year CD rates that are as good as five-year returns, while some one-year CD rates are even better than five-year certificates

                Sometime before the end of 2024, inflation is expected to be tamed, interest rate hikes will pause or even reverse, and long-term rates will return to topping near-term rates

                While the average five-year CD rate is 1.18%, savers can get an APY of 4.39% from First Internet Bank and even 4.50% from BMO Harris for accounts with a balance of as little as $1,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Interest rate volatility has made things even better when it comes to one-year CDs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, savers can get three-year CD rates that are as good as five-year returns, while some one-year CD rates are even better than five-year certificates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While one-year rates may continue to best five-year rates, that won’t last forever
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sometime before the end of 2024, inflation is expected to be tamed, interest rate hikes will pause or even reverse, and long-term rates will return to topping near-term rates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Savers can consider laddering CDs to grab higher short-term rates, then roll that cash into longer-term five-year CDs when short- and near-term rates begin to decline

                Shares of troubled lender Silvergate (SI) fell as much as 35% Thursday morning after the company said late Wednesday it will miss a March 16 deadline to file its already-delayed annual report

                The free flight giveaway for customers in Singapore is part of a larger “Hello, Hong Kong” campaign

            <p>
                The giveaway for free round-trip tickets, first announced by the Hong Kong flag carrier, kicked off at noon on Thursday (March 2), and was meant to last till March 8

                The giveaway for customers in Singapore is part of a larger “Hello, Hong Kong” campaign, that was first announced by the city’s Chief Executive John Lee in early February

            <p>
                The move by the Asian financial hub to woo tourists back post-pandemic includes an international, 500,000 flight ticket giveaway that has been rolled out in phases
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As was the case in Singapore, AFP had reported that Cathay Pacific’s giveaway of 17,400 round-trip tickets from Thailand to Hong Kong ended on Wednesday afternoon, despite initially being scheduled to last seven days

                About Us Advertise GEORGE TOWN, March 2 — The Penang High Court today dismissed four assemblymen’s application for an injunction to prevent the Penang state assembly from tabling a motion to vacate the seats until their appeal is heard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judicial Commissioner Azizan Md Arshad in his decision ruled that the courts have no power to interfere with the internal management of Parliament or any State Legislative Assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azizan further said the court has the power to grant an injunction to prevent any authority from doing something that is against the law, but at the same time, the court should also be careful not to exceed the jurisdiction given
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the plaintiffs had sought the court to use its discretion to prevent the duties of another body, namely the State Legislative Assembly which is also created under the State Constitution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the court cannot make any decision that will exceed the jurisdiction of the court and any issue related to the eligibility or disqualification of a member of the state assembly who has been elected through a valid election process is under the jurisdiction of the State Legislative Assembly as stated in the State Constitution

                KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 — A primary care medical officer (MO) serving at a public health clinic in Selangor attributes staff shortages to the large number of programmes run by the Ministry of Health (MOH)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Too Many Programmes, But Too Few Staff Personally, I think we need more staff because we are running multiple programmes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you have an adequate number of staff working, it reduces the burden and stress
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have to have a strong number of staff, and we need to have strength when we want to raise awareness and when we want to give the best treatment to the community.  I think everybody in MOH has very good intentions to bring the best and spread good things to the community and to deliver the best health care service in the community
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Is it adequate with all the programmes that they are running and that they are planning to run in the future? Then they start to consider everything because we don’t want medical doctors only, we want specialist consultants in the health care system, in the government service
            </p>

                KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 — A primary care medical officer (MO) serving at a public health clinic in Selangor attributes staff shortages to the large number of programmes run by the Ministry of Health (MOH)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Too Many Programmes, But Too Few Staff Personally, I think we need more staff because we are running multiple programmes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you have an adequate number of staff working, it reduces the burden and stress
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have to have a strong number of staff, and we need to have strength when we want to raise awareness and when we want to give the best treatment to the community.  I think everybody in MOH has very good intentions to bring the best and spread good things to the community and to deliver the best health care service in the community
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Is it adequate with all the programmes that they are running and that they are planning to run in the future? Then they start to consider everything because we don’t want medical doctors only, we want specialist consultants in the health care system, in the government service

                On 27 February, Hong Kong police charged 28-year-old Alex Kwong with the gruesome murder of his ex-wife, along with his father Kwong Kau, 65, and older brother Anthony Kwong, 31

                Though paid for by Choi, it had been registered in the name of Alex Kwong's father Kwong Kau, allegedly in order to avoid nearly $8m Hong Kong dollars (US$1m) in stamp duty

            <p>
                Doak caught the eye by completing three dribbles, delivering one key pass, winning five duels and taking one shot on goal during an impactful 16-minute cameo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no doubt that Doak has been deserving of his minutes with Liverpool's first team this season after scoring a sensational 10 goals and eight assists in just 17 appearances for Liverpool at youth level — that's a goal involvement every 79 minutes

                Liverpool's academy has a rich history, with Steven Gerrard one of the poster boys
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, one particularly promising academy starlet could end up saving the club millions in the transfer market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Doak caught the eye by completing three dribbles, delivering one key pass, winning five duels and taking one shot on goal during an impactful 16-minute cameo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no doubt that Doak has been deserving of his minutes with Liverpool's first team this season after scoring a sensational 10 goals and eight assists in just 17 appearances for Liverpool at youth level — that's a goal involvement every 79 minutes

            <p>
                In this respect, Doak has already shown in his limited exposure to first-team action that this comes naturally to him

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 ― Malaysia is expected to see a greater increase in digital transformation and digital trust in society, driven by the new investment from Amazon Web Services (AWS) worth RM25.5 billion over 15 years for a new infrastructure “region” in Malaysia
            </p>

                His point was the Liverpool defender’s excellence underpinned the heroics of last season AND a Holland World Cup run, but he could easily have merely said wait and see…because Van Dijk had the perfect answer here at Anfield

                It was hardly a classic goal, Jose Sa feebly patting van Dijk’s initial header from a corner straight to Diogo Jota, who tapped the ball back to the big Dutchman to nod home on 73 minutes, but memorable for its impact

                Just how important will ultimately be judged if they finish in the top four or not, but given the lack of confidence Liverpool displayed at times here, you wonder whether a draw would have killed any hope of catching Spurs

            <p>
                That seemed a long way away when Darwin Nunez had a goal ruled out for Jota’s foul on Max Kilman on 66 minutes, which seemed to sum up the home side’s luck

            <p>
                Liverpool could argue that Jota had been pushed into Kilman, and so at least deserved a penalty, and there is some truth in that, but there was no way referee Paul Tierney was ever going to offer such a radical interpretation

                Reading his witness statement, Swampillai said SRC International had initiated the use of fiduciary funds in 2011
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Within a fairly short period of time, these fiduciary fund transactions were also undertaken by various related and affiliated companies, such as 1MDB, Brazen Sky Ltd and Aabar BVI, which also became clients of BSI,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Investments in fiduciary funds are often directed by the investor (client), and the fund manager’s role is to carry out the client’s instructions by implementing those instructions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is unlike traditional investment funds, where investments are decided and managed by the fund managers on a discretionary basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness also said the origins of the use of such fiduciary funds by companies such as 1MDB, SRC, Brazen Sky and Aabar could be traced back to a meeting he had in 2011 with fugitive businessman, Low Taek Jho, or better known as Jho Low, who had inquired about the inner workings of fiduciary funds with BSI
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Low had told BSI on numerous occasions that he was an adviser to Najib, which Swampillai had heard from his superiors

                Reading his witness statement, Swampillai said SRC International had initiated the use of fiduciary funds in 2011
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Within a fairly short period of time, these fiduciary fund transactions were also undertaken by various related and affiliated companies, such as 1MDB, Brazen Sky Ltd and Aabar BVI, which also became clients of BSI,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Investments in fiduciary funds are often directed by the investor (client), and the fund manager’s role is to carry out the client’s instructions by implementing those instructions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is unlike traditional investment funds, where investments are decided and managed by the fund managers on a discretionary basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness also said the origins of the use of such fiduciary funds by companies such as 1MDB, SRC, Brazen Sky and Aabar could be traced back to a meeting he had in 2011 with fugitive businessman, Low Taek Jho, or better known as Jho Low, who had inquired about the inner workings of fiduciary funds with BSI
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Low had told BSI on numerous occasions that he was an adviser to Najib, which Swampillai had heard from his superiors

            <p>
                “Just strictly enforce the immersive and dual language programme, where students can opt for Mathematics and Science in English, and the level of English education will be enhanced,” Mak added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The English language requirement in the job market depends on the company’s needs; some don’t stress having fluency in English, but of course, a strong grasp of the language is still seen as an extra advantage,” she said

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The synthetic chemicals are present in soil and waterways across the globe, and a new study yesterday found that toilet paper “should be considered as a potentially major source” of PFAS in wastewater treatment systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The researchers said reducing PFAS in wastewater is “critical”, since the chemicals are potentially harmful

            <p>
                (This tool can help match you with potential advisors while you navigate the lead-up to retirement.)   Comparing Your Mortgage Rate to Investment Return Many people like to frame the decision of whether they should pay off their mortgage as a tradeoff between  the interest rate on their mortgage and the return they could earn if they had invested that money instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The idea is that if they can earn a higher rate of return than what they pay in interest, they are better off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That same element of risk isn't present when you pay down a debt balance with a fixed interest rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's because you know the amount that you save – it's that fixed interest rate.  So, the question evolves

                I've been debating whether to pay off my mortgage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (This tool can help match you with potential advisors while you navigate the lead-up to retirement.)   Comparing Your Mortgage Rate to Investment Return Many people like to frame the decision of whether they should pay off their mortgage as a tradeoff between  the interest rate on their mortgage and the return they could earn if they had invested that money instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The idea is that if they can earn a higher rate of return than what they pay in interest, they are better off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That same element of risk isn't present when you pay down a debt balance with a fixed interest rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's because you know the amount that you save – it's that fixed interest rate.  So, the question evolves

                Yet now, thanks to sub Iliman Ndiaye’s fine, late solo goal, their side are out of the race for their most likely route to silverware for another season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Brazil’s No9 beat the offside trap to race in down the right-hand side of the box, but smashed his shot from an acute angle over the bar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fortunately for Spurs, the Malian shanked his shot into the side netting, blowing the best chance of the half
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Conte no doubt will have been screaming at the TV back home, frustrated that his side were not at the races once again in what has been an infuriatingly inconsistent season

                Brentford striker Ivan Toney has admitted breaking English Football Association (FA) rules relating to betting prior to appearing before a disciplinary panel, sources have told ESPN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Toney has been charged with a total of 262 breaches between February 2017 and January 2021 when he was a player at Scunthorpe United, Wigan Athletic, Peterborough United and Brentford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Wednesday, Toney expressed his concern about the process and criticised the FA over what he perceives to be potential lapses of confidentiality as he prepares to argue his case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I was shocked and disappointed to see press speculation yesterday and today about The FA investigation process concerning me after I have been told by The FA that it is a confidential process until any decision has been made," Toney wrote on Instragam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FA rule E8 states that players "shall not bet, either directly or indirectly, or instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet on the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in or in connection with, a football match or competition; or any other matter concerning or related to football anywhere in the world, including, for example and without limitation, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters." Toney could face a substantial ban which could have a major impact on Brentford's season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Toney was called up to the England squad last September but did not play a single minute and was subsequently left out of Gareth Southgate's final 26-man group for the World Cup finals in November

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 1 — Anwar, The Untold Story, which tells the story of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s political exploits, is expected to open in cinemas nationwide in May
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The film’s executive producer Zukiflee Anwar Haque or better known as Zunar, said the film is based on the period in Anwar’s life when he became finance minister from 1991 until he was fired from the Cabinet in 1998
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The story in this film is based on Anwar’s version, a version that is rarely heard by Malaysians, for example, the story of his complete investigation report when he was locked up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Actually, I have been recording Anwar’s struggles since the Reformasi movement, and I did have the desire to turn it into a film, but it was only realised after I got in touch with Viva in August 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Whether Anwar becomes Prime Minister or not was something that did not arise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                and the most beautiful moment for me was when this film was completed, Anwar was appointed as the 10th Prime Minister

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 1 — Anwar, The Untold Story, which tells the story of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s political exploits, is expected to open in cinemas nationwide in May
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The film’s executive producer Zukiflee Anwar Haque or better known as Zunar, said the film is based on the period in Anwar’s life when he became finance minister from 1991 until he was fired from the Cabinet in 1998
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The story in this film is based on Anwar’s version, a version that is rarely heard by Malaysians, for example, the story of his complete investigation report when he was locked up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Actually, I have been recording Anwar’s struggles since the Reformasi movement, and I did have the desire to turn it into a film, but it was only realised after I got in touch with Viva in August 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Whether Anwar becomes Prime Minister or not was something that did not arise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                and the most beautiful moment for me was when this film was completed, Anwar was appointed as the 10th Prime Minister

                Star Australians combine for their 24th win of the season on Wednesday night, already double their previous best haul in a campaign

                Purton’s 100th win of the season came aboard the Size-trained A Americ Te Specso at Happy Valley on Wednesday night, and after 49 of 88 meetings, the Australian remains on track to surpass Joao Moreira’s single-season Hong Kong record of 170 victories

                Purton hasn’t ridden more than nine winners for any other trainer this term, while Size’s next most prolific jockey is Alexis Badel on five

                While some have questioned Teetan’s effort aboard Romantic Warrior when the reigning Hong Kong Cup champion fell a head short against Golden Sixty in last Sunday’s Group One Gold Cup (2,000m), the general consensus has been there was little more the Mauritian could do

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Purton hasn’t ridden more than nine winners for any other trainer this term, while Size’s next most prolific jockey is Alexis Badel on five

            <p>
                In Purton’s first premiership season in 2013-14, and again when he took the title in 2019-20, Size didn’t provide him with a single winner
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While some have questioned Teetan’s effort aboard Romantic Warrior when the reigning Hong Kong Cup champion fell a head short against Golden Sixty in last Sunday’s Group One Gold Cup (2,000m), the general consensus has been there was little more the Mauritian could do

                Former Brazil forward Ronaldinho's son has signed a permanent contract with Barcelona's under-19 team, the Catalan club have announced
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ESPN reported in January that Joao Mendes de Assis Moreira, 18, was training with Barca's Juvenil A side pending a decision on whether to hand him a deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that Mendes' contract will run until summer next year, when the forward would exit the U19 age bracket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The teenager had been playing for Cruzeiro since he was 14 but rescinded his contract with the Brazilian side at the end of last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mendes' move to Barcelona will allow Ronaldinho to spend more time back in the city where he spent five years as a player, from 2003-08
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldinho, 42, has already been in Barcelona while his son has been on trial at Camp Nou and he turned out in Gerard Pique's Kings League last weekend

                For the SV variant, a six-speed manual is the only transmission pairing, but all other petrol-only variants (V, VX and ZX) can be optioned with a CVT

                The City Hybrid also comes with an electronic parking brake and rear disc brakes instead of the petrol-only variants’ standard handbrake and rear drums.

                With the optional E-Four all-wheel drive system, a second electric motor dubbed the 1WM with 41 PS (40 hp or 30 kW) and 84 Nm is added, increasing the system output to 199 PS (196 hp or 146 kW)

                The result is a total system output of 223 PS (220 hp or 164 kW), although the PHEV is purely a front-wheel drive offering

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 — Employers have been warned not to abuse the Foreign Worker Employment Relaxation Plan launched last Jan 17 by replacing local employees with foreign workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sivakumar said the plan was introduced to quickly fulfil the manpower needs in critical sectors and employers should not use it as an excuse to dismiss local workers after hiring foreign workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Employers who are found to have acted in such a way have violated Section 60M of the Employment Act 1955 and can be fined up to RM50,000 if found guilty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sivakumar issued the warning after receiving reports that 102 local workers were replaced by foreign workers in Penang recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This can tarnish the image of the country’s laws and because of that I am giving a stern warning to employers that if they apply to hire foreign workers, do it correctly.” “The act of a small group of irresponsible employers has tarnished the image and credibility of the country and it has made it difficult to negotiate with the source country on the needs of foreign workers,” he said

                Meanwhile, Khaled told Dr Kelvin Yii Lee Wuen (PH-Bandar Kuching) that further Amendments to the Auku would likely be tabled in the next Dewan Rakyat meeting

                Khaled had previously informed Dewan Rakyat that there were no plans by the government to abolish the Auku as the law was still needed for universities administrative purposes.

                Muhammad asked if amendments would be made to the Auku to allow political parties to set up branches on university campuses

                Earlier, Khaled told Muhammad that appointments of vice chancellors of public universities would be done by the Higher Education Minister in accordance with procedures under the Auku

            <p>
                On Tuesday (Feb 28), Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof told Parliament that the government was still open to re-look the Auku
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Khaled told Dr Kelvin Yii Lee Wuen (PH-Bandar Kuching) that further Amendments to the Auku would likely be tabled in the next Dewan Rakyat meeting

            <p>
                Khaled had previously informed Dewan Rakyat that there were no plans by the government to abolish the Auku as the law was still needed for universities administrative purposes.

                For the average American, healthcare in retirement will cost more than they have in their entire savings account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And unfortunately, Medicare won't help
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Role of Medicare Much of the reason for this has to do with the Medicare program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Medicare has a reputation for simplicity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Men enrolled in this program only need around $96,000 to meet their spending needs in retirement, while women need $113,000 on average
            </p>
            
            <p>

                For the average American, healthcare in retirement will cost more than they have in their entire savings account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And unfortunately, Medicare won't help
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Role of Medicare Much of the reason for this has to do with the Medicare program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Medicare has a reputation for simplicity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Men enrolled in this program only need around $96,000 to meet their spending needs in retirement, while women need $113,000 on average

                The statement was released after a Facebook post claiming that the portal was leaking information such as name, date of birth, address, email, bank account, and tax file number went viral
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The post, made by Adil Hidayat on the Pendakwah Teknologi page, claimed that once a person’s MyKad was keyed into the portal, this information was visible under developer mode, specifically the Network tab
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He suspected that the developer forgot to turn on this feature and made the post to warn others that their personal information could be misused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a Facebook post by LHDN at about 3pm, the portal was taken down for maintenance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Therefore, HASiL will continue to strive to improve service quality and act proactively and transparently to address this issue," LHDN said in the statement.

                Kevin, 58, is the former head of Wealth Management Services at BSI Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 44th prosecution witness in the trial, he testified to how Jho Low had heaped pressure on BSI bank over the transfers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An example of such haste by Jho Low involved 1MDB Global Investment Ltd (1MDBGIL), a 1MDB linked company which opened a bank account with BSI Bank and parked its funds under fiduciary funds under Jho Low, before transferring the money out to bank accounts linked to him elsewhere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kevin then testified of how approximately US$2.721 billion had entered 1MDBGIL’s fiduciary fund account and how most of it was transferred out at the behest of Jho Low the very next day through several transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In fact, various employees in BSI bank were put under tremendous pressure by the clients (specifically, the pressure was applied by Jho Low on Yak, who in turn pressured various departments in the bank) to expedite processes, so that the money flow from 1MDBGIL (and other 1MDB related client accounts) was transferred as quickly as possible from the BSI bank account to the account of the fiduciary fund and then on to the account of the target company,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because Jho Low had rushed these transactions, from the US$2.721 billion, a sum of US$1,060,606,065 was paid into the account of two other fiduciary funds with BSI under Jho Low, namely Devonshire Funds Ltd and EEMF

                Judge Ahmad Faizadh Yahaya meted out the fine on Muhaimi Nabil Muatnan, 35, for using his mobile phone's Telegram account to post pornographic video with the intention of annoying others

                Muhaimi Nabil who lives in Kuantan was charged under Section 233(1)(a) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 which provides a fine of not more than RM50,000 or imprisonment for up to one year or both, upon conviction

            <p>
                A warrant of arrest had been issued against Muhaimi Nabil after he failed to present himself in court when the case came up for mention last Jan 26, and today he arrived in court accompanied by the police

            <p>
                When asked the reason for the absence, Muhaimi Nabil said he was involved in a road crash in Bentong on that day, but did not lodge a report on the incident

                Kevin Michael Swampillai, a former banker of the BSI Singapore bank which has since been shut down, said he now believes the fiduciary funds were used by 1MDB and SRC to hide financial transactions from Malaysia’s scrutiny
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Swampillai also cited Low Taek Jho’s indications to BSI Bank that he was an “adviser to Najib”, with the BSI former banker saying this was told to him by his bank superiors and by Yak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yak and Swampillai’s subordinate Yeo Jiawei were also present
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Swampillai said SRC opened an account with BSI Bank soon after this meeting with Low, while Aabar and Brazen Sky also opened accounts in 2012, followed by 1MDB Global Investment Limited (1MDB GIL) in 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although there were alternative fiduciary solutions like insurance and trust structures that could be used to layer money flows and hide client identities, Swampillai noted that Low chose to use fiduciary fund structures
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Swampillai said BSI Bank’s relationship manager Yak would communicate instructions from the bank’s client 1MDB and related companies like SRC and Aabar to his wealth management services section

                Kevin Michael Swampillai, a former banker of the BSI Singapore bank which has since been shut down, said he now believes the fiduciary funds were used by 1MDB and SRC to hide financial transactions from Malaysia’s scrutiny
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Swampillai also cited Low Taek Jho’s indications to BSI Bank that he was an “adviser to Najib”, with the BSI former banker saying this was told to him by his bank superiors and by Yak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yak and Swampillai’s subordinate Yeo Jiawei were also present
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Swampillai said SRC opened an account with BSI Bank soon after this meeting with Low, while Aabar and Brazen Sky also opened accounts in 2012, followed by 1MDB Global Investment Limited (1MDB GIL) in 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although there were alternative fiduciary solutions like insurance and trust structures that could be used to layer money flows and hide client identities, Swampillai noted that Low chose to use fiduciary fund structures
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Swampillai said BSI Bank’s relationship manager Yak would communicate instructions from the bank’s client 1MDB and related companies like SRC and Aabar to his wealth management services section

            <p>
                Four other agencies, along with a national intelligence panel, still judge that the pandemic was likely the result of a natural transmission, and two are undecided, the Journal reported
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China's foreign ministry, when asked to comment on the Wall Street Journal report, which was confirmed by other US media, referred to a World Health Organization-China report that pointed towards a natural origin for the pandemic, rather than a lab leak

                Besides that, Mohd Rafizi said the government should look at GST as a better tax collection mechanism and not a mechanism for it to collect more taxes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to him, in other countries, when the people’s income reached a level that is high, a majority of the people would pay income tax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In comparison, the approach to collect income tax is more difficult than GST as GST is collected by traders for the government, so it does not need assessment and so forth,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that when the government switched from income tax to GST, the income tax rate would be reduced because the transition to GST is not to collect additional tax but because it is a better approach to collect tax
            </p>

            <p>
                Hence, in a situation where majority of the people is still not in that bracket (to pay income tax), and if we implement GST, the group with income that is not taxable will have to do so,” he further said

                The Economy Minister told Sinar Harian during an economic forum on Tuesday (Feb 28) that if implemented, GST will be progressive in nature and not just to increase government funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It's something we might look into, but until then, we have a 12 to 15 months’ time span to improve the economy as it is
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said that he believes that GST rates would be exorbitant if the government doesn't first address internal issues on administration and national spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that several steps have to be taken prior to reintroducing GST to ensure everything runs more smoothly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had said the government doesn't plan to reintroduce GST after it was abolished by the Pakatan Harapan administration in 2018.

                The Economy Minister told Sinar Harian during an economic forum on Tuesday (Feb 28) that if implemented, GST will be progressive in nature and not just to increase government funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It's something we might look into, but until then, we have a 12 to 15 months’ time span to improve the economy as it is
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said that he believes that GST rates would be exorbitant if the government doesn't first address internal issues on administration and national spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that several steps have to be taken prior to reintroducing GST to ensure everything runs more smoothly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had said the government doesn't plan to reintroduce GST after it was abolished by the Pakatan Harapan administration in 2018.

                Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag may be about to experience the same frustrations as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer heading into the summer transfer window

                Ten Hag has managed to revive Fred's career at Old Trafford with the Brazilian forming a strong partnership alongside his compatriot

                “If T20 (top 20 per cent income group) was not given petrol, diesel and LPG subsidy, the amount saved is between RM15 billion (US$ 3.3 billion) and RM17 billion, so Honourable Members please imagine how many other items we can use to assist the people in various matters in 26 ministries,” said the deputy minister.  He explained that out of the RM50.8 billion spent by the government on petrol, diesel and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) subsidies in 2022, 35 per cent - or RM17 billion - had benefitted the T20.  Meanwhile, the lowest income group (B40) accounted for only 24 per cent, while the middle-income group (M40) used 41 per cent.  Mr Ahmad was responding to a parliamentary query by Kuala Terengganu Member of Parliament (MP) Ahmad Amzad Hashim, who asked how those from the M40 who dropped down to the B40 group in the city areas will receive the benefits of targeted subsidies if they are put in place

                “The company was given permission to import eggs from India based on their track record in bringing eggs from India to Qatar to meet the needs of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.  “With the company's ability to deliver eggs in a short time, the ministry has agreed to grant special import approval for a period of six months commencing December 2022,” the ministry told Dewan Rakyat in a written reply dated Tuesday (Feb 28)
            </p>

                Wan Saiful also asked the government to state the reason to import eggs from India, which are more expensive and the egg size is smaller; the list of the AP holders for egg imports, the way they were chosen, and the duration that this AP is in effect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a short-term intervention measure to ensure sufficient supply of eggs in the country, the ministry said it has allowed the importation of Fresh White Shell Egg type from India, weighing between 50-55 grams, which can be graded as grade D in Malaysia or medium in India
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Therefore, this production record clearly shows that egg production is sufficient for domestic needs every year, and there is a surplus that allows Malaysia to export eggs abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Malaysia is the fifth largest egg exporting country in the world, where(in) Malaysia’s main export destinations are Singapore and Hong Kong,” the ministry said

                “The company was given permission to import eggs from India based on their track record in bringing eggs from India to Qatar to meet the needs of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.  “With the company's ability to deliver eggs in a short time, the ministry has agreed to grant special import approval for a period of six months commencing December 2022,” the ministry told Dewan Rakyat in a written reply dated Tuesday (Feb 28)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nonetheless, the ministry did not reveal the name of the company that was granted this import approval

            <p>
                Wan Saiful also asked the government to state the reason to import eggs from India, which are more expensive and the egg size is smaller; the list of the AP holders for egg imports, the way they were chosen, and the duration that this AP is in effect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a short-term intervention measure to ensure sufficient supply of eggs in the country, the ministry said it has allowed the importation of Fresh White Shell Egg type from India, weighing between 50-55 grams, which can be graded as grade D in Malaysia or medium in India
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Therefore, this production record clearly shows that egg production is sufficient for domestic needs every year, and there is a surplus that allows Malaysia to export eggs abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Malaysia is the fifth largest egg exporting country in the world, where(in) Malaysia’s main export destinations are Singapore and Hong Kong,” the ministry said

                By Ambar Warrick Investing.com--Chinese business activity grew more than expected in February, rising past pre-COVID levels as an economic recovery in the country gained momentum after the relaxing of most anti-COVID restrictions this year.  The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’s Index (PMI) rose 52.6 in February, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The figure was higher than expectations for a reading of 50.5, and January’s figure of 50.1.  China’s Non-manufacturing PMI fared far better, rising 56.3 in February- more than expectations for growth of 55.0, and well above than the prior month’s reading of 54.4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Strength in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity saw China’s composite PMI jump 56.4 in February- its fastest pace in over three years
            </p>

            <p>
                The Caixin Manufacturing PMI read 51.6 for the month, more than expectations of 50.2 and well above the 49.2 seen in January.  The survey, which focuses on smaller, private industries, indicates that a manufacturing recovery was broad-based in February.  “Both manufacturing supply and demand expanded last month, as production gradually returned to normal while both domestic and external demand improved after a COVID policy shift," Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group said in a note.   The non-manufacturing sector was boosted by pent-up demand for services after three years of zero-COVID

                On Feb 21, Adam Radlan pleaded not guilty at the Sessions Court here to two charges of soliciting and accepting bribes involving the same project, while on Feb 22, he also pleaded not guilty at the Shah Alam Sessions Court to two more charges of accepting bribes amounting to RM4.1mil for similar projects

                Liverpool reportedly has a new transfer priority, with Jürgen Klopp having identified a midfielder who looks a good fit to ultimately succeed Thiago Alcântara

            <p>
                As such, it is likely that Liverpool could add more established midfielders to its squad ahead of next season — especially with rumored top target in this area of the pitch, Jude Bellingham, being only 19

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! In a sense, Barella's playing style is likely to draw comparisons with Thiago Alcântara, who at his best in a Liverpool shirt has demonstrated similar qualities

                In many ways, this would represent the kind of astute foresight which paid such dividends for Liverpool during early days of Klopp at the club.

                Dr Wee, who is MCA president, also suggested gradually increasing the proposed RM12,000 individual relief to RM15,000 in three years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This will help Malaysians, particularly the B40 and M40, who are affected by inflation,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “These two steps are more effective in helping the M40, particularly those affected by the rising inflation,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Wee commended the government for allocating RM1bil in Budget 2023 to provide RM500 to each of the two million Employees Provident Fund (EPF) aged 40 to 54 who have less than RM10,000 in their Account 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said he was concerned that there were two million people in this age group who had less than RM10,000 in their EPF
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Wee said the government must accurately identify “target groups” in its plans to give the RM500 EPF contribution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In addition, the RM500 contribution should not include inactive EPF members, as they may no longer reside in Malaysia or they may be a permanent resident, who should not be accepting the contribution.”

                Dr Wee, who is MCA president, also suggested gradually increasing the proposed RM12,000 individual relief to RM15,000 in three years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This will help Malaysians, particularly the B40 and M40, who are affected by inflation,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “These two steps are more effective in helping the M40, particularly those affected by the rising inflation,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Wee commended the government for allocating RM1bil in Budget 2023 to provide RM500 to each of the two million Employees Provident Fund (EPF) aged 40 to 54 who have less than RM10,000 in their Account 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said he was concerned that there were two million people in this age group who had less than RM10,000 in their EPF
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Wee said the government must accurately identify “target groups” in its plans to give the RM500 EPF contribution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In addition, the RM500 contribution should not include inactive EPF members, as they may no longer reside in Malaysia or they may be a permanent resident, who should not be accepting the contribution.”

                With Malaysia hosting an estimated 158,000 refugees from Myanmar, Anwar is under domestic pressure to address the situation.   Anwar also used the trip to refloat a proposal for an Asia Monetary Fund (AMF), which was first proposed by Japan during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis

                As long as Anwar can deftly navigate his tricky domestic political situation, he may very well be able to lead Malaysia and the region when Kuala Lumpur is scheduled to chair ASEAN in 2025

                Steve Nicol thinks Arteta's Arsenal fully deserve the 1-0 win at Leicester in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saliba was reported to have suffered personal issues, including family bereavement, during this period and by the time he was sent on loan once more for the 2021-22 season, this time to Marseille, his career at Arsenal looked over before it began
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Continuing where he left off, Saliba was finally given his chance at Arsenal this season and has not looked back, starting all 24 Premier League games as the Gunners have exceeded all expectations in leading the title race into March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saliba's individual transformation has been nothing short of staggering
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sheer scale of Saliba's improvement is palpably a factor here, given he earns around £40,000 a week currently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saliba is entitled to demand a huge hike of his own, commensurate with those around him and his rapidly-growing reputation in the game

                Steve Nicol thinks Arteta's Arsenal fully deserve the 1-0 win at Leicester in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saliba was reported to have suffered personal issues, including family bereavement, during this period and by the time he was sent on loan once more for the 2021-22 season, this time to Marseille, his career at Arsenal looked over before it began
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Continuing where he left off, Saliba was finally given his chance at Arsenal this season and has not looked back, starting all 24 Premier League games as the Gunners have exceeded all expectations in leading the title race into March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saliba's individual transformation has been nothing short of staggering
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sheer scale of Saliba's improvement is palpably a factor here, given he earns around £40,000 a week currently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saliba is entitled to demand a huge hike of his own, commensurate with those around him and his rapidly-growing reputation in the game

            <p>
                Roth conversions make the most sense when you can choose to pay the income tax on your IRA balance and move it to a Roth in a relatively low-income tax year

                What Are RMDs? You don’t pay taxes on the money in your IRA or 401(k) when you put it in, which is why these accounts are considered tax-advantaged retirement accounts

                The money will be taxed according to your current tax bracket in retirement

            <p>
                As a result, while the Fair Tax Act as written proposes a 23% inclusive tax, it would be a 30% tax in the way that virtually all taxpayers calculate sales taxes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One study from 2011 found that the results of a 30% sales tax, as proposed under the Fair Tax Act, would shift the nation’s tax burden overwhelmingly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Virtually all tax experts to study the issue agree that it would complicate the tax code and act as a massive tax cut for the wealthy

                As written, the Fair Tax Act is misleading
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, while the Fair Tax Act as written proposes a 23% inclusive tax, it would be a 30% tax in the way that virtually all taxpayers calculate sales taxes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One study from 2011 found that the results of a 30% sales tax, as proposed under the Fair Tax Act, would shift the nation’s tax burden overwhelmingly

            <p>
                Virtually all tax experts to study the issue agree that it would complicate the tax code and act as a massive tax cut for the wealthy

                Joseph Schooling's withdrawal from the SEA Games again raises the retirement question after a glittering career

                The Hanoi SEA Games in May 2022 was his last meet

            <p>
                The trio’s support was suspended by Sport Singapore and they were banned from national team training for a month after an internal review
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Schooling, Teong and Lim were also fined $10,000, $3,200 and $2,800 respectively by the Singapore National Olympic Council for breaching its code of conduct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The only SEA Games rookie in the squad is Nicholas Mahabir, 17, and owner of the 100m breaststroke national record
            </p>

            <p>
                Schooling, Teong and Lim were also fined $10,000, $3,200 and $2,800 respectively by the Singapore National Olympic Council for breaching its code of conduct

                Australia’s Avalon International Air Show, which began April 28, exhibits a wide range of new defense technologies, including a new Australian-made lethal drone

                Unmanned aerial technology is already establishing itself as a major air show theme

            <p>
                The designers of this UAV believe that the deadly drone may be produced locally within three years.  The STRIX, developed by BAE Systems and Perth-based Innovaero, is Australia’s first domestically designed, manufactured, and armed VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) uncrewed air system (UAS), according to the company.  The firm said that the partnership merges Innovaero’s experience in designing and manufacturing aerospace products for the Australian market with BAE Systems’ expertise in autonomous platforms and its vehicle management system (VMS) technology

            <p>
                Another Australian-designed uncrewed system, called MQ-28A ‘Ghost Bat,’ was publicly unveiled during the 2019 Avalon Airshow after being discreetly developed by aerospace giant Boeing in cooperation with the RAAF and the Defense Department.

                Earlier, Chetan had urged the court to allow the injunction to prevent the Penang state assembly from tabling the motion to vacate the seats until the appeal is heard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If the court is not able to allow the injunction, I hope the court can stop the Penang State assembly speaker from informing the Election Commission after the motion to vacate the seats is tabled, debated and passed," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Surendra argued that the state assembly duties must be carried out and if there are parties who are not satisfied, only then can the case be taken to court

            <p>
                On Jan 20, the High Court dismissed the lawsuits by four Penang assemblymen against the Penang State Legislative Assembly and State Assembly Speaker Datuk Law Choo Kiang over a motion introduced in October 2020 for them to vacate their seats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The four assemblymen had filed the suit in 2020 to challenge the constitutionality of Article 14A(1) of the Penang State Constitution, and to stop their seats from being declared vacant, pursuant to Article 14A(1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Article 14A of the Penang State Constitution states that a state assemblyman shall vacate his seat if having been elected as a candidate of a political party, he resigns or is expelled from a party or having been elected otherwise than as a candidate of a political party, he joins a political party

                David Moyes has provided an injury update on his West Ham squad before facing Manchester United in the FA Cup

            <p>
                At his pre-match press conference, Moyes spoke about the injuries Lukasz Fabianski and Vladimir Coufal picked up in Saturday’s 4-0 win over Nottingham Forest
            </p>

                That is a boost for United but they cannot take this game lightly, as they were reliant on David de Gea to preserve a 1-0 Premier League win earlier this season

            <p>
                That means you would expect this game to be another tight one, with United needing to get right back to serious business after basking in the glow of Sunday’s Wembley triumph.

                About Us Advertise   KOTA KINABALU, Feb 28 — Even with the vision of a Sabah “unity government” to mirror the federal government no longer on the cards, prime minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has today praised chief minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor for out-manoeuvring his political nemeses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, on his first official visit to Sabah as prime minister, said he was impressed with the soft-spoken Hajiji’s political astuteness that has stabilised the state’s political landscape with his two-thirds majority in the state government

                The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) reflected a reduction in food prices to 54.4 per cent in February from 60 per cent last month, but non-food inflation climbed to 58.8 per cent, the Census and Statistics Department said in a statement

                Sri Lanka has been struggling with soaring prices for over a year, largely caused by its worst financial crisis since it gained independence from Britain in 1948

                Sri Lanka’s national consumer price inflation, which is released with a lag of 21 days every month, eased to an annual rate of 53.2 per cent in January from 59.2 per cent in December

                Rashford has now hit 25 goals in all competitions for United this season, a figure that is not only significant because it is his record tally for a single campaign, but because it is more than Cristiano Ronaldo notched throughout all of last season

            <p>
                So often, it felt that if he didn't score, then United wouldn't either
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is the same expectation that was placed on Ronaldo during his United pomp, and it is a huge credit to Rashford that he has so often been able to deliver the goods to go along with it this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford has helped United move on from Ronaldo, but now they find themselves back in a similar situation where they are relying on one player to grab most of their goals

                Rashford has now hit 25 goals in all competitions for United this season, a figure that is not only significant because it is his record tally for a single campaign, but because it is more than Cristiano Ronaldo notched throughout all of last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford netted just five
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is the same pressure and privilege that Ronaldo had last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So often, it felt that if he didn't score, then United wouldn't either
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is the same expectation that was placed on Ronaldo during his United pomp, and it is a huge credit to Rashford that he has so often been able to deliver the goods to go along with it this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford has helped United move on from Ronaldo, but now they find themselves back in a similar situation where they are relying on one player to grab most of their goals

                Liverpool want Chelsea star N'Golo Kante, according to new reports, as part of their epic summer rebuild Liverpool are targeting Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante, in what would be a surprise move to bolster their midfield.  The Reds are looking towards the future with an influx of talent expected to rejuvenate the side this summer

                Liverpool, however, might be in a better position to offer a deal the 31-year-old is keen on.  Liverpool want to bring in an expensive talent in Bellingham – and are in the market for Josko Gvardiol (opens in new tab) and Antonio Silva (opens in new tab) – so a free transfer could help them to add another player to their squad, while building elsewhere

            <p>
                Kante is valued at around €30m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).  Jurgen Klopp has addressed the "clear need" for a Liverpool rebuild this summer – and reports suggest there could be a lot of money spent

                Malaysian Health Minister Zaliha Mustafa
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a written reply to a parliamentary question, Dr Zaliha said that among the steps taken by her ministry to increase the number of medical officers in Malaysia include expediting the appointment process of all medical graduates by omitting the interview process conducted by the Public Services Commission
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other measures include increasing the graduate training slots at the health ministry as well as reappointing retired medical officers on a contractual basis, said Dr Zaliha.  She added that the health ministry is also encouraging Malaysian specialists working overseas to return home and serve the country.  Dr Zaliha was responding to a question from Puchong Member of Parliament Yeo Bee Yin, who had asked the health ministry on the steps it has taken to overcome the issue of manpower in hospitals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The issue came under the spotlight more recently after local media reports highlighted issues of hospitals overflowing with patients and long waiting times at emergency departments.  Dr Zaliha on Monday said that there were 59,651 medical officers with the health ministry last year, a 6.6 per cent increase compared to the 55,973 in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Zaliha noted that based on annual trends, 70 per cent of medical officers work in the public sector while the remaining 30 per cent are in the private sector.  As for nurses, the health minister said that 60 per cent of the 115,230 nurses in Malaysia serve under the health ministry.  Separately, Deputy Prime Minister Fadillah Yusof told parliament on Tuesday that congestion at government hospitals was an indication about the improvement of the country’s healthcare system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is why the government hospital has become a focus (for people to visit),” said Mr Fadillah.  The deputy prime minister added that the overcrowding at the public hospitals also shows that Malaysians are not practising a healthy lifestyle.  “That is why more people need to go to a doctor and why the health ministry has emphasised the promotion of living healthily

                Najib’s bid for the Federal Court review concluded after a hearing that spanned over six days from January 19 until today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rule 137 of the Rules of the Federal Court 1995 recognises the Federal Court’s inherent power to review its previous decisions in order to prevent an injustice or an abuse of process, and it has been mostly used to set aside Federal Court’s decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s defence have indicated there are four grounds for the review that they want the apex court to reconsider namely; a review of the Federal Court’s earlier decision to reject the defence’s application to adduce further evidence concerning the SRC trial judge, a review of the apex court’s decision on the same day to dismiss Najib’s bid to postpone his appeal hearing, a review of the court’s decision to reject Najib’s application to recuse the Chief Justice and a review of the August 2022 decision by the five-member bench to affirm Najib’s conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A five-member panel presided over today’s hearing with Abdul Rahman leading Federal Court judges Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, and Datuk Nordin Hassan, as well as Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abu Bakar Jais
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following his incarceration last year, Najib sought to challenge the Federal Court’s August 2022 unanimous decision in affirming his conviction, sentence and fine meted out by the High Court for the misappropriation of RM42 million of SRC International Sdn Bhd fund
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Nazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal judge, sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined him RM210 million in default of five years imprisonment and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on Dec 8, 2021.

            <p>
                On July 20 last year, Dr Mahathir, 97, filed a lawsuit against Ahmad Zahid, 70, as a sole defendant, for allegedly issuing defamatory statements regarding the ‘kutty’ issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his statement of claim, Dr Mahathir claimed that Ahmad Zahid had issued a defamatory statement against him during Umno divisional meeting in Kelana Jaya on July 30, 2017, and the statement was reproduced on Astro Awani's YouTube and several online news portals, which can be accessed by internet users without any restrictions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir claimed that the slanderous statement meant that he was not born as a Malay or a Muslim with the alleged original name of "Mahathir son of Iskandar Kutty" and that he claimed to be a Malay when he became prime minister to gain political and personal advantage apart from belittling Malaysians of Indian Muslim descent

            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 20 last year, Dr Mahathir, 97, filed a lawsuit against Ahmad Zahid, 70, as a sole defendant, for allegedly issuing defamatory statements regarding the ‘kutty’ issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his statement of claim, Dr Mahathir claimed that Ahmad Zahid had issued a defamatory statement against him during Umno divisional meeting in Kelana Jaya on July 30, 2017, and the statement was reproduced on Astro Awani's YouTube and several online news portals, which can be accessed by internet users without any restrictions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir claimed that the slanderous statement meant that he was not born as a Malay or a Muslim with the alleged original name of "Mahathir son of Iskandar Kutty" and that he claimed to be a Malay when he became prime minister to gain political and personal advantage apart from belittling Malaysians of Indian Muslim descent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Ahmad Zahid in his statement of defence filed on Aug 17 last year through Messrs

                Lisandro Martinez joined Man United from Ajax last summer and has become an instant fans' favourite
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag, though, knew what the Reds would be getting from the defender, who he had signed at Ajax back in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He's a warrior and I think the fans will admire him," said Ten Hag, outlining why he had made the decision to add him to United's squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But also, he's also skilful and he can deal with the ball and he's left-footed." If Ten Hag thought United's fans would admire Martinez, he underestimated the size of the impact he would have
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has exceeded expectations by some distance and has cemented himself as one of Ten Hag's most important disciples
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag vowed that United's fans would appreciate him and warm to his demeanour and style of play, but even he could not have predicted just how popular he has become

                Lisandro Martinez joined Man United from Ajax last summer and has become an instant fans' favourite
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag, though, knew what the Reds would be getting from the defender, who he had signed at Ajax back in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He's a warrior and I think the fans will admire him," said Ten Hag, outlining why he had made the decision to add him to United's squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But also, he's also skilful and he can deal with the ball and he's left-footed." If Ten Hag thought United's fans would admire Martinez, he underestimated the size of the impact he would have
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has exceeded expectations by some distance and has cemented himself as one of Ten Hag's most important disciples
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag vowed that United's fans would appreciate him and warm to his demeanour and style of play, but even he could not have predicted just how popular he has become

                More info Manchester United could be tempted to move for five Paris Saint-Germain stars in the summer as the Ligue 1 giants are reportedly attempting to slash their wage bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here, Express Sport looks at five players who United may target this summer that would slash PSG’s wage bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PSG’s right-back sensation Achraf Hakimi may be unlikely to leave the club this summer as he is one of the best in the world and one of the team’s few stars on an affordable salary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Big money could be spent in that area and Hakimi would likely be the best right-back on the market if he was made available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly to their right-back situation, United could move for a goalkeeper in the summer amid uncertainty surrounding David De Gea’s position
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Messi is in negotiations regarding a new contract and while Neymar could be made available at the right price, United would prefer to bring Mbappe to Old Trafford
            </p>

                More info Manchester United could be tempted to move for five Paris Saint-Germain stars in the summer as the Ligue 1 giants are reportedly attempting to slash their wage bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here, Express Sport looks at five players who United may target this summer that would slash PSG’s wage bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PSG’s right-back sensation Achraf Hakimi may be unlikely to leave the club this summer as he is one of the best in the world and one of the team’s few stars on an affordable salary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Big money could be spent in that area and Hakimi would likely be the best right-back on the market if he was made available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly to their right-back situation, United could move for a goalkeeper in the summer amid uncertainty surrounding David De Gea’s position
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Messi is in negotiations regarding a new contract and while Neymar could be made available at the right price, United would prefer to bring Mbappe to Old Trafford
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>
                        <p> </p>

            <p>
                “If we don't want T20 to get petrol, diesel and LPG subsidies anymore, the estimated savings are RM15 billion to RM17 billion,” he told Hulu Terengganu MP Datuk Ahmad Amzad Mohamed

            <p>
                Ahmad explained that the mechanism excludes the top 20 per cent of income earners in Malaysia from purchasing cheaper fuel, in particular RON95 grade petrol, diesel, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Breaking down the estimated consumption of petrol, diesel and LPG in 2022, he said the bottom 40 per cent of wage earners used 24 per cent and the middle 40 per cent of income earners used 41 per cent while the top 20 per cent of income earners known as the T20 group used as much as 35 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So in terms of numbers, RM50.8 billion if we multiply the 35 percent used by T20, the value is RM17.8 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Can you imagine how many other things we can use from the RM15 billion to RM17 billion to help the people in various matters and affairs in 26 ministries?” he asked

                Ahmad explained that the mechanism excludes the top 20 per cent of income earners in Malaysia from purchasing cheaper fuel, in particular RON95 grade petrol, diesel, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Breaking down the estimated consumption of petrol, diesel and LPG in 2022, he said the bottom 40 per cent of wage earners used 24 per cent and the middle 40 per cent of income earners used 41 per cent while the top 20 per cent of income earners known as the T20 group used as much as 35 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So in terms of numbers, RM50.8 billion if we multiply the 35 percent used by T20, the value is RM17.8 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Can you imagine how many other things we can use from the RM15 billion to RM17 billion to help the people in various matters and affairs in 26 ministries?” he asked

                In a report on Monday (Feb 27), Chinese state-controlled Global Times (GT) said the low cost carrier is among an array of overseas carriers that are ramping up flights in China in recent days, in tandem with China’s cross-border travel recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It cited AirAsia group chief commercial officer Karen Chan as telling a press conference that the firm is planning to run over 340 flights per week in China by the fourth quarter this year, compared with about 320 flights in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chan was quoted as saying that the carrier was also hoping to open new flight routes between China and Indonesia along with China and Cambodia this year, to bring the total to more than 40, compared with 39 in 2019, subject to government approval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The newspaper reported that Singapore Airlines said it plans to gradually increase the frequencies of fixed passenger flights to China from March 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It will increase the number of flights between Beijing and Singapore, from the original three flights a week to one flight a day
            </p>

                In a report on Monday (Feb 27), Chinese state-controlled Global Times (GT) said the low cost carrier is among an array of overseas carriers that are ramping up flights in China in recent days, in tandem with China’s cross-border travel recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It cited AirAsia group chief commercial officer Karen Chan as telling a press conference that the firm is planning to run over 340 flights per week in China by the fourth quarter this year, compared with about 320 flights in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chan was quoted as saying that the carrier was also hoping to open new flight routes between China and Indonesia along with China and Cambodia this year, to bring the total to more than 40, compared with 39 in 2019, subject to government approval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The newspaper reported that Singapore Airlines said it plans to gradually increase the frequencies of fixed passenger flights to China from March 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It will increase the number of flights between Beijing and Singapore, from the original three flights a week to one flight a day

            <p>
                Flights between Shanghai and Singapore will gradually increase from the original four flights a week to two flights a day, and flights between Guangzhou and Singapore will increase from the original three flights per week to a daily flight

                “This project is being funded by the Japanese government for five years until the end of fiscal year 2024 and after that, we will use the C4 for commercial production of various products from the microalgae biomass,” he said in an exclusive interview with The Borneo Post here yesterday

                Hoshino said the project is funded by the Japanese government to the tune of approximately 2.5 billion yen (more than RM80 million) to demonstrate the mass production of microalgae biomass throughout the year

                Hoshino added that once bio-jet fuel – otherwise known as ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ – could be mass produced from microalgae biomass, they would eye exporting the product not only to Southeast Asian countries, but also to the United States and Europe

            <p>
                Moreover, Hoshino highlighted that Sarawak was selected as a preferred location for the microalgae farm due to the ideal temperature throughout the year, abundance of fresh water, and the state being safe from major natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes

                During the debate in Parliament, Johari questioned the former administration's "poor" negotiations on Goldman Sachs' US$2.5bil (RM10.7bil) settlement over its role in the 1MDB scandal, claiming it was unfair
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We were satisfied with the US$2.5bil settlement because we achieved our political objectives." So far, the terms of the settlement agreement have been withheld due to a confidentiality provision prohibiting its publication
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim demanded that Goldman Sachs honour its agreement with the government over its role in the 1MDB scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under a settlement in October 2020, Goldman Sachs was to pay US$2.5bil while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4bil of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the globe.

                China claims to have used artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate an aerial battle involving a hypersonic aircraft traveling at Mach 11

            <p>
                During the computer simulation, a hypersonic aircraft came into contact with an adversary fighter jet moving at Mach 1.3, or about an F-35’s top speed

            <p>
                The pilot of the hypersonic aircraft then received an order to shoot down the enemy aircraft, presumably the US stealth fighter

            <p>
                Even so, aircraft traveling at Mach 5 and higher hypersonic speeds do not yet have fire-control systems for launching missiles

            <p>
                The AI developed by Liu’s team could boost battle effectiveness in hypersonic aircraft.  However, fire-control systems for launching weapons for aircraft flying at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5 and above have yet to be developed

                Maybank, which released its fourth quarter (4Q) and full financial year results for 2022 yesterday, saw net profit inch up 1.7% to RM8.23bil for the year ended Dec 31, 2022, on the back of a 10.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) rise in revenue to RM50.9bil

            <p>
                Meanwhile, chief executive and group president Datuk Khairussaleh Ramli drew attention to the group’s pre-tax profit, which rose by 21.6% y-o-y to RM2.21bil for the quarter under review, while for the full year, pre-tax profit climbed 11.6% y-o-y to RM12.2bil

            <p>
                While the group has seen its loans grow 6.7% in Malaysia last year, Khairussaleh said he is expecting loan take-up to moderate in 2023

                Meanwhile, Maybank said its group Islamic banking has seen pre-tax profit increase by 8% y-o-y to RM4.79bil, contributing 67.2% of loans and financing against 32.8% of conventional financing, up from the 64.9% of 2021

                When discussing ideology and religion, it (should not) be devoid of humanity and compassion,” he said in his keynote address yesterday at the International Forum on Islamophobia, which also included Deputy Prime Ministers Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister said that in reacting to Islamophobia, it is important to ensure that it is in accordance with Islamic teachings

            <p>
                Zambry said Malaysia will not allow Islamophobia to continue unabated, as this would be complicit in the violation of fundamental human rights
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Muslims should have the right to profess their faith without fear of discrimination, persecution or intimidation, as the right to believe and practise one’s religion is enshrined in international law as a fundamental human right

                About Us Advertise   PARIS, Feb 28 ― Lionel Messi won the Best Fifa men's player prize for 2022 yesterday on the back of his World Cup triumph with Argentina and Spain's Alexia Putellas retained the women's award at a ceremony in Paris
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Messi beat his Paris Saint-Germain teammate, and World Cup final rival, Kylian Mbappe to the men's gong with Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema having been the other contender to claim the prize
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is the second time that Messi has won the honour inaugurated by Fifa in 2016 after football's world governing body split from Ballon d'Or organisers France Football

                Welcome to the ESPN Singapore Edition Julien Laurens says it's time for Chelsea to move on from Graham Potter, with no improvement to be seen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is clear Potter needs more time; his problem is that very few Chelsea fans are prepared to let him have it

            <p>
                Most supporters want Boehly to adopt a similarly cold approach now with regard to Potter's tenure, but will he be so brave? Sacking Potter would get the fans off his back, but it would also expose Boehly's original judgement to have been flawed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Potter's critics argue that his success at Brighton was no guarantee that he could work in a more demanding environment at a top-four club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Could he accept what might be a "fallow year" in the belief that Potter will eventually come through?

                — Bernama THE proposed luxury goods taxes in Budget 2023 may deter tourists from shopping in Malaysia, says Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainuddin (PN-Larut)

                In his Budget 2023 speech last Friday, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said there are plans to introduce a luxury goods tax on items such as luxury watches and fashion items this year
            </p>

                He said the government could introduce a windfall tax mechanism to ensure those with extraordinary wealth assist the poor

            <p>
                However, he commended the government for its plans to reduce income tax rates by two percentage points for those earning RM100,000 and below annually

                Beyond The Summit played a significant role in shaping the esports scene of Dota 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company pioneered grassroots tournaments in the early years of Dota 2, before the inception of the Dota 2 Pro Circuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company also led the way in broadcast innovation for Dota 2 esports, introducing the 'teamfight recap' feature before Valve integrated it into its native client and pioneering the use of battle passes in third-party tournaments in the Source 1 version of Dota 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond The Summit's presence in the Dota 2 community will be greatly missed, as its contributions to the game and its esports scene have been invaluable

                The company’s co-founder David “LD” Gorman explained that it was no longer sustainable to run the company’s esports operations in its current structure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company’s last event will be the Smash Ultimate Summit 6, although there are calls for one last crowd-funded Dota Summit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond The Summit played a significant role in shaping the esports scene of Dota 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company pioneered grassroots tournaments in the early years of Dota 2, before the inception of the Dota 2 Pro Circuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company also led the way in broadcast innovation for Dota 2 esports, introducing the 'teamfight recap' feature before Valve integrated it into its native client and pioneering the use of battle passes in third-party tournaments in the Source 1 version of Dota 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond The Summit's presence in the Dota 2 community will be greatly missed, as its contributions to the game and its esports scene have been invaluable

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 28 — Australia respects any decision by the Malaysian government in regards to the operations of the rare earth plant in Gebeng, Pahang belonging to Lynas Rare Earths Ltd, visiting Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was responding to a question during an interview with Bernama that the Australian mining company’s subsidiary in Malaysia, Lynas Malaysia Sdn Bhd’s, could lose its operating license if it failed to comply with conditions prohibiting the production of radioactive waste in the country after July 1 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though the Atomic Energy Licensing Board (AELB) had approved the renewal of Lynas Malaysia Sdn Bhd’ license for a period of three years from March 3, 2023, until March 2, 2026, cracking and leaching (C&L) activities that produce radioactive waste can no longer be conducted in Gebeng, Pahang after July 1

            <p>
                Malaysian Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Chang Lih Kang on February 15 said all license conditions that have been decided for the period of March 3, 2020 until March 2, 2023 must continue to be complied with by Lynas
            </p>

            <p>
                Since operating in Malaysia in 2012, Lynas has produced approximately 1.08 million metric tonnes of radioactive waste (WLP residue), and this amount of waste is expected to reach 1.2 million metric tonnes by July 2023

                Arnault, 73, born in France, may be most well-known today for his founding and current leadership of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury goods company, but how he got there involved one French Franc ($0.16 USD), real estate in the French Riviera, and condominiums in Palm Beach, Florida
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Around five years into being at his father’s firm, he convinced the company and his father to liquidate the construction division and enter the real estate market — Arnault earned $15 million in the sale

                Named a company director in 1974, and named CEO in 1977, Arnault started building timeshares on the Mediterranean coast of southeastern France

                Anupama said, “I am really happy because this has been my first tournament with World Women’s Snooker and the first couple of days I was finding it really hard to adjust to the tables, it was like a completely new environment for me but I just wanted to enjoy what I was doing on the table and not thinking too much about whether I win or lose

                Recently, a US surveillance aircraft had a very close and dangerous encounter with a Chinese Shenyang J-11 fighter jet over the South China Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As per reports, the American aircraft was shadowed by the J-11 for well over an hour, and at one point, the Chinese fighter jet was barely 500 feet off the port side of the US surveillance aircraft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The incident came shortly after a US Air Force (USAF) RC-135 aircraft had a dangerously close encounter with a Chinese J-11 fighter jet in December 2022 over the South China Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Chinese fighter jet came within 10 feet (three meters) of the American surveillance aircraft, forcing the latter to perform evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision

                Deputy Agriculture and Food Security Minister Chan Foong Hin said the government also took note that the supply of several food products has been affected due to the spread of zoonotic diseases such as African Swine Fever (ASF) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in source countries

                But there is a market we should be worrying about far more – the American one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the US market crashes, it will tip the economy into recession, and that will ripple out across the world

            <p>
                In 2008, the collapse of the subprime mortgage market triggered a global financial crisis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is not a crash yet, but it is very close to one
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In reality, the solvency of the American financial system remains critically dependent on the health of the housing market

                Senior Fire Officer II Mohamad Shahidan Abd Razat, 34, who had just reported for duty at the Perlis Fire and Rescue Department was among 140 selected for the Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (Smart) that was sent for the search and rescue (SAR) mission after a massive earthquake struck Turkiye in early February

            <p>
                Relating his experience during the SAR operation, the father of four said he was saddened to see a husband crying uncontrollably after the rescue team pulled out the body of his pregnant wife from the rubble

                This, he said, is because the tax reduction in the lower taxable income bands offsets the tax increase in the higher taxable income brackets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government will also increase the tax rate by 0.5 to two percentage points for the RM100,000 to RM1 million taxable income bands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Finance Ministry data, the tax hike represents an additional tax of between 0.4% and 4.6% of taxable income for some 150,000 taxpayers in the higher income group
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the other hand, those who earn below RM100,000 a year — some 2.4 million taxpayers — would enjoy tax savings of between 12.1% and 16.7% of their taxable income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He pointed out that as wage earners shoulder the burden of income tax, the current structure allows others who earn the same amount to escape from paying tax simply because their gains are structured as capital gains

                This, he said, is because the tax reduction in the lower taxable income bands offsets the tax increase in the higher taxable income brackets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government will also increase the tax rate by 0.5 to two percentage points for the RM100,000 to RM1 million taxable income bands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Finance Ministry data, the tax hike represents an additional tax of between 0.4% and 4.6% of taxable income for some 150,000 taxpayers in the higher income group
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the other hand, those who earn below RM100,000 a year — some 2.4 million taxpayers — would enjoy tax savings of between 12.1% and 16.7% of their taxable income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He pointed out that as wage earners shoulder the burden of income tax, the current structure allows others who earn the same amount to escape from paying tax simply because their gains are structured as capital gains

            <p>
                In October 2018, the Pakatan Harapan government filed an application in the London High Court to challenge a consent award recorded by the arbitration tribunal in May 2017 — with IPIC and Aabar PJS as claimants and 1MDB and MoF Inc as respondents — under which Malaysia was to pay US$5.78 billion to IPIC and the bond trustee over five years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, Malaysia took the position that IPIC and Aabar were aware that 1MDB had been defrauded and the central role Najib had played in the scam, and that Najib was principally responsible in getting 1MDB and the MOF Inc to consent to the arbitration award
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the US$5.78 billion, US$1.46 billion had been paid by October 2018, according to Thomas, leaving a balance of US$4.32 billion, with interest payments of US$50 million each to be paid periodically and the final bullet payments — representing the principal and interest of US$1.8 billion each — to be paid in May and October 2022.  In its legal challenge, Malaysia claimed that as a result of the fraud, it should be relieved from any obligation to pay the balance US$4.32 billion to IPIC or Aabar under the consent award, and additionally had a right to recover the sum already paid

                Affin Bank's fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2022 net profit fell by a third on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to RM138.26mil while the quarter's revenue was marginally lower at RM566.71mil from RM572.13mil in the same quarter a year ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The improvement in pre-tax profit was supported by an increase in the group's net interest income which rose by 13.9% to RM1.02bil compared to FY21 and an increase of 39.3% to RM346mil in the pre-tax profit of Affin Islamic Bank Bhd

                Affin bank president and group chief executive officer Datuk Wan Razly Abdullah said the strong growth profits were also contributed by the gains from our divestment of Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Affin Bank said its loan and financing portfolios grew by 15.4% y-o-y with its net interest margin expanding to 2.01% from 1.97% in FY21
            </p>

            <p>
                “But if there isn’t a suit against Goldman Sachs in the US, what for you file the suit here? “The suit should be filed there only then they will talk,” he said
            </p>

                He explained that in the US, once a suit is filed, they cannot underwrite any other businesses until they solve the problem

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 27 — Treasury secretary-general Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican has said that the government did not want to increase income tax rates for those with annual earnings above RM1 million, as it felt that the top tax rate of 30 per cent was already “sufficiently high”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It’s only about one per cent of our labour force, so we’re not even talking about T20, we are talking about T1," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                T20 is the abbreviation commonly used to refer to the top 20 per cent of income earners, and similarly T1 for the top 1 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Are we saying that even one per cent is too many people to pay more taxes?” Johan asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is where he felt that a group such as 150,000 people who are the top one per cent of the labour force..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                it is not asking too much for the top one per cent of the labour force to contribute a little bit towards the well-being of the country,” he said.

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 27 — Treasury secretary-general Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican has said that the government did not want to increase income tax rates for those with annual earnings above RM1 million, as it felt that the top tax rate of 30 per cent was already “sufficiently high”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It’s only about one per cent of our labour force, so we’re not even talking about T20, we are talking about T1," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                T20 is the abbreviation commonly used to refer to the top 20 per cent of income earners, and similarly T1 for the top 1 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Are we saying that even one per cent is too many people to pay more taxes?” Johan asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is where he felt that a group such as 150,000 people who are the top one per cent of the labour force..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                it is not asking too much for the top one per cent of the labour force to contribute a little bit towards the well-being of the country,” he said.

                About Us Advertise   PUTRAJAYA, Feb 27 — Datuk Seri Najib Razak derailed the entirety of his final appeal at the Federal Court over his SRC International conviction and sentencing last year when he changed his legal counsel at the eleventh hour, prosecutors said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Telling the Federal Court during the former prime minister’s bid to have the apex court’s decision reviewed, ad hoc prosecutor Datuk V Sithambaram said Najib’s bid to change ‘horses’ so close to the scheduled hearing dates was a ‘strategy gone wrong’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sithambaram’s remark echoed his previous argument that Najib was the author of his misfortune and consequently cannot invoke the Federal Court’s inherent jurisdiction to review its own decision in his final appeal hearing last August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, ZIST opted to discharge themselves, leaving Hisyam as the remaining sole counsel in Najib’s defence whose request for dischargement was however denied by the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A five-member panel presided over today’s hearing with Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Datuk Abdul Rahman Sebli leading Federal Court judges Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, Datuk Nordin Hassan and Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abu Bakar Jais on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Nazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal judge, had sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined him RM210 million in default five years imprisonment and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on December 8, 2021.

                Liverpool would, of course, rather be in contention for everything, as they were last season

            <p>
                To many, this may bring about feelings of jealousy, but it could play to Liverpool’s advantage when both sides meet in two weeks, a game which could decide the Red’s top four chances

            <p>
                Despite United boasting a bigger squad than what Liverpool had last season with a squad of 32 compared to Liverpool’s 30, those two extra players won’t make a huge difference when it comes down to fitness levels and sharpness of the entire team

            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Of course, United won’t play those 14 games during the two weeks before England’s biggest teams face each other
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 14-game difference may not sound like a lot on paper but in reality, the players will suffer greatly from being overused which could play a huge role when playing what will be a well-rested Liverpool side

            <p>
                Liverpool’s downfall this season could play to their advantage as United come to Anfield to meet a more energized and vivacious team could have the advantage due to their relaxed schedule.

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Of course, United won’t play those 14 games during the two weeks before England’s biggest teams face each other
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 14-game difference may not sound like a lot on paper but in reality, the players will suffer greatly from being overused which could play a huge role when playing what will be a well-rested Liverpool side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool’s downfall this season could play to their advantage as United come to Anfield to meet a more energized and vivacious team could have the advantage due to their relaxed schedule.

                Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said one of the causes of Islamophobia is a lack of understanding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Why do people say it (the allocation) is a lot? "We must get people to read the Quran and its translation so that we can understand the religion and save Islam from Islamophobia,” he said after delivering a keynote address at the International Forum on Islamophobia here on Monday (Feb 27)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the tabling of the revised Budget 2023 on Friday (Feb 24), Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said RM10mil would be allocated to translate and distribute the Quran in Swedish and other foreign languages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 27, the Prime Minister announced that the government would print one million copies of the Quran as a symbol of wisdom and maturity to respond to prejudicial and uncivilised attacks on Islam.
