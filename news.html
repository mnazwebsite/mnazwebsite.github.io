                And with Wout Weghorst failing to score in seven league games since joining on loan in January, it’s little wonder Ten Hag is ‘in the front row’ to sign the Serbian striker this summer

                The 23-year-old has eight goals from 16 Serie A games this season but has failed to score in six of his last seven league outings, so his future in Turin could be uncertain

                Vlahovic has spent three months out with injury too, so he’s only netted twice in Serie A since October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Juventus spent €81m (£71.7m) on the 23-year-old, so they would likely want most of that money back if they were to agree a sale

                Liverpool will be looking to make several additions this summer with midfield an area of particular pressing concern

            <p>
                Liverpool made a mistake in not signing a midfielder last summer, with the rushed loan signing of Arthur and his subsequently struggles demonstrating that a lack of preparation can be costly

                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim told the Dewan Rakyat on Thursday that he agreed with the criticism Johari had raised on Malaysia’s settlement deal with Goldman Sachs on 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last week, Johari said the government should review its deal with Goldman Sachs for its role in the scandal as the final sum was “too low”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Goldman Sachs profited off our hardship and pain.” Goldman Sachs and the Malaysian government are currently in dispute over how much the US bank owes Malaysia for its role in raising US$6.5bil (RM29.4bil at present exchange rates) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The settlement announced by the previous government in July 2020 called for Goldman Sachs to pay US$2.5bil (RM11.3bil) while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4bil (RM6.33bil) of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the world, in exchange for Malaysia dropping charges against the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johari last week said the US$2.5bil figure agreed upon was too little, and Goldman Sachs should be made to pay the US$1.4bil sum outright
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “How can we allow Goldman Sachs just to run away like that when its senior management was involved?” Johari was the second finance minister during Najib ’s administration at the height of the 1MDB scandal

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, March 11 ― Former England football captain Gary Lineker has been taken off air by the BBC after his comments on Britain's migration policy sparked a furious row between the government and the corporation's highest paid presenter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lineker was told there has to be an agreed position on his use of social media before he can return, the BBC said yesterday, with Director General Tim Davie saying it had taken a “proportionate action”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The row overshadowed a migration deal struck between British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron, with the BBC accused of bowing to political pressure

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, March 11 ― Former England football captain Gary Lineker has been taken off air by the BBC after his comments on Britain's migration policy sparked a furious row between the government and the corporation's highest paid presenter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lineker was told there has to be an agreed position on his use of social media before he can return, the BBC said yesterday, with Director General Tim Davie saying it had taken a “proportionate action”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The row overshadowed a migration deal struck between British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron, with the BBC accused of bowing to political pressure
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 11 — The federal government is only expected to table in June the proposed amendment to enable foreign-born children of Malaysian mothers to automatically gain citizenship here, Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said has confirmed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Bill to amend the Constitution is expected to be tabled during the next sitting since there are some issues to be further deliberated, especially the issue of dual citizenship,” she said in a written response to Malay Mail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A Cabinet committee on the citizenship issue has been formed and is currently deliberating on issues pertaining to citizenship in preparation for the next sitting,” she said, when asked whether the Bill would be tabled in the year’s second meeting from June 12 to June 27 or the third that will go from October 9 to November 30
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Yes, it is needed by virtue of Article 159 of the Federal Constitution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on Azalina’s response, this would mean that the Cabinet committee will be finalising issues related to the Bill such as how the amended citizenship law would be implemented, with the government expected to present the finalised Bill to the Conference of Rulers for consent, before finally tabling the Bill in Parliament once royal consent is obtained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The proposed amendment would also result in Malaysian mothers being able to enjoy the same right — as guaranteed under Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution which disallows gender discrimination — to pass on their citizenship to their children born abroad, which Malaysian fathers currently already possess

                When we look at Liverpool’s Allison and Manchester City’s Ederson, their technical ability and pinpoint accuracy when helping their team move the ball up the pitch breeds confidence in their teammates and allows the team to become less one-dimensional

                Dalot’s comfortability when receiving the ball at his feet or on the half term and his calmness of playing out from the back alongside his passing range and crossing ability was a key factor in Ten Hag’s decision to opt with Dalot over Wan-Bissaka

            <p>
                During his time at United, he has often looked shaky when on the ball and lacking in terms of passing and crossing ability but since the World Cup break, he has had to step in for the injured Dalot and has looked like a new player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Dalot was substituted for Wan-Bissaka at half-time, United started to regain their control in the match thanks to the right-back’s quick one-touch passing and calmness on the ball

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 — Attorney General Tan Sri Idrus Harun today rejected allegations that his agency engaged in selective prosecution and persecution, such as Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia leaders alleged over the charges against Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement was issued shortly after the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission sent out its own to insist on its complete independence in the investigation of the JanaWibawa scheme, for which it has charged three Bersatu leaders including Muhyiddin today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The AG said his office rejected the allegations of bias and persecution against any individual, before insisting that the decisions to prosecute were made without fear or favour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier today, Muhyiddin was charged with four counts of corruption and two counts of money laundering, becoming the latest Bersatu leader to be prosecuted over the Bumiputera assistance scheme launched when he was the prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, he reiterated his claims of political motive, purporting that the charges against him were meant to put his party on par with Umno, which is part of the current government and whose president Zahid remains on trial for corruption
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bersatu had pre-emptively claimed persecution even before its leaders began to be charged over the JanaWibawa scheme, and began doing so after the party’s bank accounts were frozen as part of the MACC investigation earlier this year.

                About Us Advertise   PUTRAJAYA, March 10 — Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor has withdrawn her appeal to recuse High Court Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal Judge, from hearing her money laundering and tax evasion case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the notice of discontinuance filed by Messrs Geethan Ram on March 1, Rosmah as the appellant withdrew the appeal which was filed through a notice of appeal dated April 29, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following that, the appeal is deemed to have been dismissed as stipulated in Rule 73, Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994

            <p>

            <p>
                In November last year, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal postponed the hearing of Rosmah’s appeal because the court wanted the defence and prosecution to file further submissions on whether it had the jurisdiction to hear the appeal

                Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) president Abdul Hadi Awang giving a speech at a religious gathering in Terengganu, Malaysia on Mar 4, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The unity government comprises PH, Barisan Nasional, Gabungan Parti Sarawak and Gabungan Rakyat Sabah, among others.  "It is very unbecoming of an MP to make a statement saying there are efforts by the opposition to topple the government," said Amanah exco member Fadhli Umar Aminolhuda after lodging the police report, according to The Star
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Such a statement will only lead to trouble and disrupt public order.” On Tuesday, Amanah president Mohamad Sabu expressed concern that Mr Abdul Hadi’s remarks would drive away investors from the country.  “When a big leader like (Abdul) Hadi Awang mentions (the desire to) change the government, (and) not through elections, it can scare and unsettle investors,” he said in a video posted on Facebook.  “It is known … that the change of three prime ministers in a short time has affected the flow of investments to Malaysia.” On Monday, local media reported Mr Abdul Hadi as saying that based on Malaysia’s democratic system, no one had the right to stop PN’s efforts to topple the government of the day.  He said that such an attempt can be done either through a vote of no-confidence or via statutory declarations, according to Bernama.  "This is normal in a democratic country (such as Malaysia),” he was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times (NST).  He added that the king’s decree is not “the final word” to prevent change from happening in a democratic country.  “We still uphold democracy based on our constitutional monarchy,” he reportedly said.  He had previously cautioned the government against blaming the opposition if the government collapses again, saying that the blame should be placed on the government’s own flaws and weaknesses instead.  Last year, Mr Abdul Hadi reportedly said that he had initiated the “Sheraton Move” which saw the fall of the short-lived PH administration back in 2020, leading to several years of political instability in the country.  Meanwhile, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) youth chief Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal on Friday defended Mr Abdul Hadi, claiming that the latter’s remarks were “misconstrued” by the media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Wan Fayhsal said that the Marang MP was explaining that in a parliamentary democracy, a change in government could always happen despite an anti-hopping law in place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The options are always there for a shift of alignment of parties or MPs to support anyone among us to become the prime minister,” he said, according to Free Malaysia Today (FMT).  He also claimed that the PH coalition appeared to be afraid.  “My answer is simple, if you truly have two-thirds support (in parliament), why are you afraid? Why are you so afraid to the point of urging the home minister to use a security measure to probe an ‘academic’ comment from a politician about a change in government?” he was quoted as saying by FMT.

                In 2023, the Blue Oval is introducing a new version called the Puma ST Powershift, which does things a little differently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the bonnet, the 1.5 litre powerplant is replaced with a 1.0 litre three-cylinder EcoBoost engine that is accompanied by a 48-volt mild hybrid system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Such a setup isn’t new for the Puma, but on the ST Powershift variant, you get 170 PS (168 hp or 125 kW) and 248 Nm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The non-ST version of the Puma with a mild hybrid powertrain manages as much as 155 PS (153 hp or 114 kW) and 240 Nm – the gains are down to tweaks to the powertrain software and higher recharging capability of the mild hybrid system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Puma ST Powershift’s figures are still far from the manual variant, but the main appeal is the standard seven-speed dual-clutch transmission
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The styling is identical too, although there’s a new Azura Blue colour for 2023

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 — Datuk Mohd Radzi Md Jidin of Bersatu has retained his position as Putrajaya Member of Parliament, after an election court rejected a petition that was filed against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was after High Court Judge Datuk Faizah Jamaludin allowed a preliminary objection made by Mohd Radzi to strike out the petition filed by Putrajaya Umno division vice chief Datuk Ahmad Faisal Abdul Karim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I find the petition has not complied with rule 4 (1) (b) of the election petition rules and therefore, defective,” the judge said via online proceedings today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thus, this petition is struck out,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, the court also ordered Ahmad Faisal to pay RM20,000 in costs to Mohd Radzi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the petition filed on January 26, Ahmad Faisal was seeking a court order to declare that Mohd Radzi should not have been declared the winner of the Putrajaya seat in the 15th general election on November 19 last year as his alleged bribes of RM150 each induced voters to vote for him and not other candidates

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 — Datuk Mohd Radzi Md Jidin of Bersatu has retained his position as Putrajaya Member of Parliament, after an election court rejected a petition that was filed against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was after High Court Judge Datuk Faizah Jamaludin allowed a preliminary objection made by Mohd Radzi to strike out the petition filed by Putrajaya Umno division vice chief Datuk Ahmad Faisal Abdul Karim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I find the petition has not complied with rule 4 (1) (b) of the election petition rules and therefore, defective,” the judge said via online proceedings today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thus, this petition is struck out,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, the court also ordered Ahmad Faisal to pay RM20,000 in costs to Mohd Radzi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the petition filed on January 26, Ahmad Faisal was seeking a court order to declare that Mohd Radzi should not have been declared the winner of the Putrajaya seat in the 15th general election on November 19 last year as his alleged bribes of RM150 each induced voters to vote for him and not other candidates
            </p>

                Earlier this month, the telco extended its free 5G trial to April 30, with Digi users slated to get continued access via a 5G booster add-on plan costing RM10 a month after April
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Celcom users on the other hand can only obtain 5G connectivity under certain plans after the free trial, without an add-on plan option
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s also worth noting that there hasn’t been a fee confirmation on the Celcom front

                This follows the High Court on Friday (March 10) striking out the election petition filed by a 49-year-old voter, Datuk Ahmad Faisal Abdul Karim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                High Court judge Datuk Faizah Jamaludin allowing the preliminary objection made by Radzi in citing the petition filed by Ahmad Faisal as defective as it lacks certain particulars of the said alleged bribe that occurred in the election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court ordered Ahmad Faisal to pay RM20,000 costs to Radzi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The judge questioned if it was the PN worker who gave the bribe, while the place where he received it was not stipulated — and whether this was in connection with Radzi’s election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is difficult to make a case under Section 32(c) of the Election Offences Act to allege the payment was in connection with Radzi or with his knowledge, or with his agent’s knowledge, or with the bribe given to vote for Radzi or refrain from voting for other candidates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Faisal was represented by Datuk Mohd Hafarizam Harun and Nor Hazirah Abu Hayan, while Yusfarizal Yusoff and Ahmad Lutfi Awang appeared for Radzi

                This follows the High Court on Friday (March 10) striking out the election petition filed by a 49-year-old voter, Datuk Ahmad Faisal Abdul Karim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                High Court judge Datuk Faizah Jamaludin allowing the preliminary objection made by Radzi in citing the petition filed by Ahmad Faisal as defective as it lacks certain particulars of the said alleged bribe that occurred in the election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court ordered Ahmad Faisal to pay RM20,000 costs to Radzi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The judge questioned if it was the PN worker who gave the bribe, while the place where he received it was not stipulated — and whether this was in connection with Radzi’s election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is difficult to make a case under Section 32(c) of the Election Offences Act to allege the payment was in connection with Radzi or with his knowledge, or with his agent’s knowledge, or with the bribe given to vote for Radzi or refrain from voting for other candidates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Faisal was represented by Datuk Mohd Hafarizam Harun and Nor Hazirah Abu Hayan, while Yusfarizal Yusoff and Ahmad Lutfi Awang appeared for Radzi

                Former leader faces trial on charges of money laundering and abuse of power over COVID-19 contracts

            <p>
                Malaysia’s former Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has been charged with abuse of power and money laundering in connection with the awarding of government contracts during the COVID-19 pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He faces four counts of abuse of power involving 232.5 million ringgit ($51.40 million), and two counts of money laundering involving 195 million ringgit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dozens of people gathered at the court to show their support for Muhyiddin with some wearing bandanas emblazoned with the word ‘Abah’ (father), which was how Muhyiddin referred to himself during the pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin was granted bail of 2 million Malaysian ringgit ($442,674) by the judge and asked to surrender his passport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin became Malaysian prime minister after an internal power struggle within the reformist coalition that came to power in May 2018

                Any player who produces a vivacious showing against a huge team like Liverpool is almost instantly connected with top clubs across Europe as they try and snatch the next top talent before anybody else can, much like what happened with Núñez or Mykhailo Mudryk for Chelsea

                About Us Advertise HAMBURG, March 10 — Several people have been killed in a shooting at a Jehovah’s Witness centre in Hamburg, with the gunman believed to be among the dead, German police said Thursday

            <p>
                “Several people were seriously injured, some even fatally,” police said on Twitter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police did not give an exact death toll, but several German media outlets said at least six people had been killed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first police at the scene found several lifeless bodies and seriously wounded people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have no indications of a perpetrator on the run,” said the police spokesman

            <p>

                Anwar told Parliament late on Thursday (March 9) that he agreed with criticism Johari (BN-Titiwangsa) had raised on Malaysia’s settlement deal with Goldman Sachs on 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Goldman Sachs profited off our hardship and pain.” Goldman Sachs and the Malaysian government are currently in dispute over how much the US bank owes Malaysia for its role in raising $6.5bil (RM29.4bil at present exchange rates) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The settlement announced by the previous government in July 2020 called for Goldman Sachs to pay US$2.5bil (RM11.3bil) while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4bil (RM6.33bil) of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the world, in exchange for Malaysia dropping charges against the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Why should we sacrifice money that we can get from the number one investment bank in the world?” Johari said on Feb 27, to thumps of approval from fellow lawmakers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How can we allow Goldman Sachs just to run away like that when its senior management was involved?” Johari was the second finance minister during jailed former premier Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s administration at the height of the 1MDB scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He lost his parliamentary seat in 2018 but won it back in November’s general election, and has since raised the Goldman Sachs issue in Parliament and in interviews with local media

                Paul Scholes felt the challenge was not a red card offence but conceded it was 'stupid'   Some fans on Twitter felt the Man United man was lucky to stay on the pitch after the challenge  There was also a feeling that the challenge received lenient treatment 'because it's Bruno.' Aside from the midfielder's late challenge, United enjoyed an excellent bounce back on Thursday after suffering their heaviest loss since 1931 in the previous outing

                Paul Scholes felt the challenge was not a red card offence but conceded it was 'stupid'   Some fans on Twitter felt the Man United man was lucky to stay on the pitch after the challenge  There was also a feeling that the challenge received lenient treatment 'because it's Bruno.' Aside from the midfielder's late challenge, United enjoyed an excellent bounce back on Thursday after suffering their heaviest loss since 1931 in the previous outing

                In a statement yesterday, EPF said another factor was structural wage challenges, whereby 44% of EPF contributors earn less than RM2,000 and 81% of them have an income of less than RM5,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only 45% of the 4.81 million members in this age group made contributions in 2022, while the rest did not contribute at all last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other factor is that 59% of the 2.85 million members in this age group applied for Covid-19 related withdrawals and withdrew more than RM62bil in total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As at the end of December 2022, there were 4.81 million EPF members in the 40-54 age range, with 2.17 million of them being active members and the remaining 2.64 million being inactive members (defined as having made no contributions in the past year)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                EPF, meanwhile, welcomes the government’s move to contribute RM500 on a one-time basis to the accounts of both active and inactive members to encourage more Malaysians to increase their retirement savings

                They named MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki, MACC senior director of investigation Datuk Seri Hishamuddin Hashim, MACC anti-money laundering division director Datuk Mohamad Zamri Zainul Abidin, Immigration director-general Datuk Seri Khairul Dzaimee Daud, 13 MACC officers along with the MACC, the Immigration Department and the government as respondents

            <p>
                On Muhyiddin’s travel ban, the applicants sought a declaration that the ban, without any reasonable basis, is illegal and a violation of Articles 5, 8, 9 and 10 of the Federal Constitution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The application sought a court declaration that the respondents had violated the constitutional rights of Bersatu and Muhyiddin

                The Umno president and Deputy Prime Minister said the decision was in accordance with provisions in the Act and required validation by the Registrar of Societies (ROS)

            <p>

            <p>
                As mentioned by the Home Minister, if anyone is unhappy with the decision, they can bring the matter to court," Ahmad Zahid reiterated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin had said in Parliament on Wednesday that if any Opposition MPs were dissatisfied with the Home Ministry’s move to rectify a decision by the Registrar of Societies (ROS) against Umno, they could challenge the matter in court

                The Umno president and Deputy Prime Minister said the decision was in accordance with provisions in the Act and required validation by the Registrar of Societies (ROS)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former Umno vice president Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein had asked on Wednesday (March 8) why Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail had become involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hishammuddin, who was handed a six-year suspension by Umno in January, was commenting on an Instagram video posted by Khairy Jamaluddin on Tuesday (March 7) about Saifuddin's decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The matter is outlined in Section 70 of the Act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As mentioned by the Home Minister, if anyone is unhappy with the decision, they can bring the matter to court," Ahmad Zahid reiterated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin had said in Parliament on Wednesday that if any Opposition MPs were dissatisfied with the Home Ministry’s move to rectify a decision by the Registrar of Societies (ROS) against Umno, they could challenge the matter in court

                The Nissan Leaf 2023 is officially priced at RM168,888 on-the-road excluding insurance in Peninsular Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s new with the Nissan Leaf 2023? In terms of the drivetrain and battery, the 2023 model remains unchanged from the pre-facelifted version
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the floor, the new Leaf for Malaysia still gets a 40kWh battery with a rated 311km maximum driving range (NEDC) on a single charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides the new vibrant colours, the Nissan Leaf 2023 gets a full black aero front grille with an updated Nissan Logo, grey-accent diffuser, revised bumper and a new redesigned aero spoiler at the rear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On top of that, the Nissan Leaf still comes with a space-saver spare tyre underneath the boot, which can be a lifesaver

                During a press conference in Parliament today, Ahmad Zahid, who is also the deputy prime minister, denied the claim, saying that it was normal for Umno to address the concerns of two members about the party’s no-contest motion for its top two posts that was decided during the last Umno General Assembly

                Two complainants are challenging the motion presented at Umno General Assembly and the proposal was examined by a permanent chairman who follows all the rules of the general assembly and all clauses in the (party’s) constitution

                Two days ago, Saifuddin said he had, using his power as the home minister under Section 70 of the Societies Act, decided to exempt Umno from complying with that Act’s Section 13(1)(c)(iv) in relation to the approved motion in the 2022 Umno general assembly to not have the top two posts contested, after the reference was made to Umno’s party constitution and its rules

                But Ng has asked Brodie to sentence him to no jail time in the US, arguing that the six months he spent in a Malaysian prison before extradition to New York and four years of house arrest were punishment enough.  Agnifilo on Wednesday also argued that Ng deserves leniency because the Malaysian government “has been made whole” because he relinquished claims to US$35.1 million that it seized from his accounts

            <p>
                Ng and his former Goldman boss, Tim Leissner, were accused of conspiring with Malaysian financier Jho Low, the scheme’s alleged mastermind

            <p>
                He will be sentenced in September but will likely get less time due to his cooperation

            <p>
                Prosecutors say Leissner made US$73.4 million in the scheme.  Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak received US$756 million and Khadem al-Qubaisi, a former managing director of Abu Dhabi’s state-owned International Petroleum Investment Co, which guaranteed the 1MDB transactions, got US$472.8 million, a forensic accountant with the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified at Ng’s trial.  Goldman paid more than US$2.9 billion to US authorities and more than US$5 billion globally for its role in the scheme, with its Malaysian unit pleading guilty in the US to a single conspiracy charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The government already sent its message to the world about Goldman when it accepted its money for a deferred prosecution agreement,” Agnifilo wrote on Wednesday

                About Us Advertise   SHAH ALAM, March 9 ― The Societies Act 1966 (Act 832) is a law approved by Parliament, and if there are parties who want it amended, the matter should be brought up in Parliament, said Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If there is disagreement, you have to look back at the Societies Act 1966
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is an act that was approved by Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said this to comment on the video clip of former Rembau Member of Parliament, Khairy Jamaluddin, who was not satisfied with Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail's decision to grant exemption to Umno in accordance with Section 70 of the Societies Act 1966 (Act 832), regarding the party's election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Umno's next direction, Ahmad Zahid expects that the party's new leadership line-up, which will be elected, will work with him to translate the implementation of the party's new direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said that the direction, which has 21 steps, will be announced and realised after the party's election on March 18

                About Us Advertise   SHAH ALAM, March 9 ― The Societies Act 1966 (Act 832) is a law approved by Parliament, and if there are parties who want it amended, the matter should be brought up in Parliament, said Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If there is disagreement, you have to look back at the Societies Act 1966
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is an act that was approved by Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said this to comment on the video clip of former Rembau Member of Parliament, Khairy Jamaluddin, who was not satisfied with Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail's decision to grant exemption to Umno in accordance with Section 70 of the Societies Act 1966 (Act 832), regarding the party's election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Umno's next direction, Ahmad Zahid expects that the party's new leadership line-up, which will be elected, will work with him to translate the implementation of the party's new direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said that the direction, which has 21 steps, will be announced and realised after the party's election on March 18

                Speaking to StarBiz at a dinner hosted by StarBox Group Holdings Ltd, which is the first Malaysia-based company to list on the Nasdaq exchange in the United States with foreign private issuer status, he said AGP is exploring to discover more Malaysian companies with the potential to list on US exchanges

                Anthony Loke said that the project could go on as long as it is not government-funded

                The minister, however, said that the government has yet to receive a complete proposal from any party

                “A lot of parties are talking about the project, but we have not received any complete proposals

                However, the project was put on hold in September 2018, with both sides agreeing to shelf the bilateral project worth RM110bil until Dec 31, 2020

                Malaysia and Singapore jointly announced the termination of the project on Jan 1, 2021, due to a lack of agreement on Malaysia’s proposed changes and the fact that the agreement had expired on Dec 31, 2020

                Anthony Loke said that the project could go on as long as it is not government-funded

                The minister, however, said that the government has yet to receive a complete proposal from any party

                Malaysia and Singapore jointly announced the termination of the project on Jan 1, 2021, due to a lack of agreement on Malaysia’s proposed changes and the fact that the agreement had expired on Dec 31, 2020

                welcome back! — and with the squad still in need of reinforcements at key positions, Liverpool are back in the transfer rumour section with a vengeance, linked with players left and right in the past few days

                Anwar had said that the government will implement a rigorous review to deploy the service of the 5G network in Malaysia

                The post which saw Wong unable to hold back her tears during Lee’s speech at an event, was shared on Lee’s social media (Instagram and Facebook) yesterday

                The video was also shared by Lee in conjunction with International Women’s Day

                Lee also complimented his second son Terrance for comforting Wong in the video while cheekily asking the whereabouts of his eldest son, Kingston, during the speech

                Spurs were knocked out of Europe's premier cup competition by AC Milan after failing to score in both legs as the Serie A club progressed 1-0 on aggregate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Richarlison, who was signed by Spurs in the close season in a deal worth 60 million pounds ($71.21 million), has found game time hard to come by under Conte and played only the last 20 minutes against Milan in the 0-0 draw at home
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I played five minutes against Wolves, asked the reason and no one told me why," Richarlison told TNT Sports Brazil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There was no explanation again, let's see what he (Conte) will tell us on Thursday but I'm not silly, I'm a professional that works hard every day and I want to play." Richarlison netted three times for Brazil at the World Cup but has scored only two goals for Tottenham this season and the 25-year-old has yet to open his account for the club in the Premier League, where they are fourth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I'll try to score as many goals as I can because the club has paid a lot of money for me and I haven't given enough back on the pitch yet

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spurs were knocked out of Europe's premier cup competition by AC Milan after failing to score in both legs as the Serie A club progressed 1-0 on aggregate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Richarlison, who was signed by Spurs in the close season in a deal worth 60 million pounds ($71.21 million), has found game time hard to come by under Conte and played only the last 20 minutes against Milan in the 0-0 draw at home
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I played five minutes against Wolves, asked the reason and no one told me why," Richarlison told TNT Sports Brazil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There was no explanation again, let's see what he (Conte) will tell us on Thursday but I'm not silly, I'm a professional that works hard every day and I want to play." Richarlison netted three times for Brazil at the World Cup but has scored only two goals for Tottenham this season and the 25-year-old has yet to open his account for the club in the Premier League, where they are fourth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I'll try to score as many goals as I can because the club has paid a lot of money for me and I haven't given enough back on the pitch yet
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                The landslide struck Monday on Serasan Island, located in the Natuna region between Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As of 11.50am (12.50pm, Singapore time) today, nine bodies have been found," local government spokesperson Patli Muhamad told AFP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bodies were found buried under the rubble and landslide debris at Pangkalan village, Muhamad said, adding that 24 people are still missing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The head of Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) Suharyanto, who goes by one name, said the Natuna district government had agreed to relocate dozens of families away from the affected area to mitigate the risks from future disasters

                In the post, Muhyiddin denied a report by a portal which said he was arrested at a golf course on Wednesday, saying it was fake news

                Aside from Muhyiddin, Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz — who was finance minister during Muhyiddin’s tenure as PM from 2020 to 2021 — had also been called in by the MACC in February, although he declined to say if it is related to Jana Wibawa

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 — Home Minister Senator Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has defended his decision to exempt Umno from deregistration over its motion to prohibit contests for its top two posts during internal elections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dissatisfied with Saifuddin’s answer, Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan (Perikatan Nasional - Kota Baru) then asked the minister to verify a supposed letter from the Registrar of Societies (RoS) to Umno directing the party to take “corrective measure” over the motion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Opposition chief whip said the minister’s decision to exempt Umno could have broad ramifications for all parties in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Saifuddin said he had, using his power as the home minister under Section 70 of the Societies Act, decided to exempt Umno from complying with that Act’s Section 13(1)(c)(iv) in relation to the approved motion in the 2022 Umno general assembly to not have the top two posts contested, after the reference was made to Umno’s party constitution and its rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Section 70 states the home minister’s power to use his discretion to exempt any society registered under the Societies Act from all or any of the provisions of the Act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid said Umno’s secretary-general had received a letter from the Home Ministry to approve the no-contest motion for the top two posts and said it was sufficient to prove that the motion was legitimate, also insisting that the Home Minister has the final say.

                Asked about the ringgit which has gone past RM4.50 against the US dollar currently and its impact on Malaysia's economy, he said the weaker ringgit would mean export prices would be cheaper, helping the country’s competitiveness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, a lower ringgit would also mean imports will go higher, and that would make inflation worse

                On whether the ringgit’s deteriorating performance would have an impact on the overnight policy rate (OPR) ahead of Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM) monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting on Thursday, he explained that theoretically, a higher interest rate could help increase the appeal of the ringgit as it can offer higher returns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "(However), the OPR is not normally set to address currency market imbalances, therefore, the movement of the ringgit would be determined by market forces

            <p>

                However, a lower ringgit would also mean imports will go higher, and that would make inflation worse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On whether the ringgit’s deteriorating performance would have an impact on the overnight policy rate (OPR) ahead of Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM) monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting on Thursday, he explained that theoretically, a higher interest rate could help increase the appeal of the ringgit as it can offer higher returns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "(However), the OPR is not normally set to address currency market imbalances, therefore, the movement of the ringgit would be determined by market forces
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ringgit was traded mostly higher against a basket of major currencies except for the euro

            <p>
                Meanwhile, the ringgit was traded mostly lower against Asean currencies

                Malaysia said on Wednesday it will summon to court the descendants of a former sultan in a dispute involving three of the government's properties in Paris, following the heirs' efforts to enforce a US$15 billion (RM67 billion) arbitration award

                The Filipino heirs of the last Sultan of Sulu won the award in a French arbitration court last year in a dispute over a colonial-era land agreement, which independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the descendants a token sum annually

                Malaysia, which did not participate in the arbitration, maintains the process was illegal and has obtained a stay on the ruling in France

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The dispute stems from an 1878 agreement that was signed between two European colonists and the Sultan of Sulu for use of his territory in present-day Malaysia

                Malaysia said on Wednesday it will summon to court the descendants of a former sultan in a dispute involving three of the government's properties in Paris, following the heirs' efforts to enforce a US$15 billion (RM67 billion) arbitration award

                Overdevelopment, deforestation and dumping of trash in rivers may also have led to the massive floods across Johor.    An aerial view shows people standing on a flooded road in Yong Peng, Malaysia's Johor state, on Mar 4, 2023

                Mr Sivakumar Packirisamy, president of the non-governmental organisation Green Earth Society in Johor, expressed concern that floodwaters have not receded in parts of the state, despite the weather being mostly sunny over the last couple of days.  He highlighted that in places like Batu Pahat for instance, the water level has actually increased, leading to more people being forced out of their homes.   “Flood mitigation measures along the rivers in Johor have to be improved

                On Monday, Johor chief minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi warned that in spite of good weather, residents of Batu Pahat needed to be wary as river water from Segamat was flowing south and causing water levels to rise in some areas.  Batu Pahat is the worst-hit district in Johor, with more than 27,000 people displaced.  Mr Ling Tian Soon, state assemblyman for Yong Peng, told CNA on Monday that a key reason why many areas of Batu Pahat were flooded was because of overflow from the Bekok River

                Welcome to the ESPN Singapore Edition Erik ten Hag reacts to his team being embarrassed by Liverpool in the Premier League in 7-0 rout
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag, who has axed Cristiano Ronaldo and publicly reprimanded Marcus Rashford since taking overlast summer, has already shown himself to be far more ruthless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag brought in Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez, Antony and Tyrell Malacia last summer at a cost of more than £220 million and the next stage of the rebuild -- if the budget allows -- is likely to include a striker, a midfielder, a full-back and a goalkeeper as United look to get closer winning the Premier League and the Champions League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                De Gea has impressed Ten Hag this season, but he believes having a goalkeeper more comfortable on the ball would help his team better control games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Everything was going so well for Ten Hag in his first season until the nightmare at Liverpool and, although he would never choose to lose so heavily, it serves as a timely reminder about the amount of work still to be done
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag is the latest manager attempting to get United back to the top of domestic and European football and although the journey so far has been positive, there are some players who will not be making the rest of the trip.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                De Gea has impressed Ten Hag this season, but he believes having a goalkeeper more comfortable on the ball would help his team better control games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Everything was going so well for Ten Hag in his first season until the nightmare at Liverpool and, although he would never choose to lose so heavily, it serves as a timely reminder about the amount of work still to be done
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag is the latest manager attempting to get United back to the top of domestic and European football and although the journey so far has been positive, there are some players who will not be making the rest of the trip.

                In a cautious report that did not identify the source of the intelligence or the group involved, the Times said the US officials had no evidence implicating Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the pipeline bombing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The intelligence suggested the perpetrators behind the sabotage were "opponents of President Vladimir V Putin of Russia", the Times report said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                German investigators believed the unidentified group were made up of five men and one woman using professionally falsified passports, according to a separate report by several German media

            <p>
                The lack of a firm suspect meant international intelligence officials had not ruled out the possibility of a "false flag" operation to link the attack to Ukraine, per the German media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A spokeswoman for the German government said it had "taken note" of the New York Times' report, referring back to the ongoing investigation

                The entrepreneur has grown US$1.8 billion wealthier this year after Sea fired thousands, froze salaries and pledged to rein in spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The initial optimism belies the scale of the task ahead for Li, a gaming enthusiast who in 2009 founded a company that’s come to symbolise Southeast Asia’s internet ascendancy

                At the time, investors piled into the company, which is backed by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, briefly making it the world’s best-performing stock
            </p>

                Then came a post-Covid hangover, when fears of a global recession wiped out more than US$160 billion of its value from a 2021 peak of more than US$200 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, investors are celebrating Sea’s getting into the black — something it would have achieved even after stripping out the one-time gains.  Li, who’s vowed to forsake his salary until his company stabilises, warned on Tuesday the macroeconomic environment remained murky and Sea was ready to adjust its approach if needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It has not been an easy journey,” Li told analysts on Tuesday’s call

                The entrepreneur has grown US$1.8 billion wealthier this year after Sea fired thousands, froze salaries and pledged to rein in spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The initial optimism belies the scale of the task ahead for Li, a gaming enthusiast who in 2009 founded a company that’s come to symbolise Southeast Asia’s internet ascendancy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the time, investors piled into the company, which is backed by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, briefly making it the world’s best-performing stock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then came a post-Covid hangover, when fears of a global recession wiped out more than US$160 billion of its value from a 2021 peak of more than US$200 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, investors are celebrating Sea’s getting into the black — something it would have achieved even after stripping out the one-time gains.  Li, who’s vowed to forsake his salary until his company stabilises, warned on Tuesday the macroeconomic environment remained murky and Sea was ready to adjust its approach if needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It has not been an easy journey,” Li told analysts on Tuesday’s call

                Meanwhile, approved investments in the manufacturing sector stood at RM84.3 billion (31.9%) and primary industry at RM26.3 billion (9.9%), said International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There were two large one-off investments that happened in 2021 from Intel and China’s Risen Energy Co Ltd,” he told reporters during the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) media conference on Malaysia’s investment performance for 2022

            <p>
                Earlier in his speech, Tengku Zafrul said foreign direct investments (FDIs) accounted for 61.7% or RM163.3 billion of the total approved investments, while domestic direct investments (DDIs) contributed 38.3% or RM101.3 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This must be improved further in the near future, especially with our renewed focus on an effective economic policy, favourable investment environment, political stability, and more coordinated investment promotion by all agencies, both at the federal government and state levels,” Tengku Zafrul said

            <p>
                As for the investment outlook for 2023, he said the moderation in global economic growth may impact investment decisions globally.  “The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank projected a positive but slower economic growth compared to the previous years, so investments will also be impacted, as it also depends on demand
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There were two large one-off investments that happened in 2021 from Intel and China’s Risen Energy Co Ltd,” he told reporters during the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) media conference on Malaysia’s investment performance for 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier in his speech, Tengku Zafrul said foreign direct investments (FDIs) accounted for 61.7% or RM163.3 billion of the total approved investments, while domestic direct investments (DDIs) contributed 38.3% or RM101.3 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This must be improved further in the near future, especially with our renewed focus on an effective economic policy, favourable investment environment, political stability, and more coordinated investment promotion by all agencies, both at the federal government and state levels,” Tengku Zafrul said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the investment outlook for 2023, he said the moderation in global economic growth may impact investment decisions globally.  “The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank projected a positive but slower economic growth compared to the previous years, so investments will also be impacted, as it also depends on demand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Investment decisions are a little different from trade as (they are) based on long-term plans

                Liverpool are expected to be in the market for reinforcements in defensive areas this summer

                Ndicka has impressed for Frankfurt this season as his team sits sixth in the Bundesliga, with the imposing center-back winning on average 2.6 aerial duels, averaging 5.2 clearances and 0.7 blocks per Bundesliga appearance this season, according to statistics from WhoScored

            <p>
                In the case of Ndicka, it is clear that Liverpool would be getting another of the Bundesliga's emerging talents, just without having to massively impact the rest of its transfer budget

            <p>
                Given Ndicka's superior fitness record when compared with current back-up options Gomez and Matip — he has played 22 times for Frankfurt in the Bundesliga this season and turned out 34 times in the league last season — it would be fair to suggest that the former Auxerre defender may prove to be a more reliable option for Klopp

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 — Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki said that the agency had so far recovered RM28.93 billion and assets siphoned through the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is a national victory for Malaysia and we were one of the agencies involved in the 1MDB task force, apart from the Attorney-General’s Chambers, the Finance Ministry and the National Anti-Financial Crime Centre,” he was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam was speaking to the press after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) and Malaysia Institute of Accountants (MIA) at the MACC headquarters yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam pointed out that MACC and UiTM had been in discussion since last year, mainly on sharing the expertise from its Accounting Faculty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With this MoU, it is hoped that we can realise cooperation between UiTM and MACC in terms of negotiation services, development of training modules, anti-corruption awareness and education programmes as well,” he reportedly said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also hoped to further strengthen the UiTM governance and integrity agenda.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 — Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki said that the agency had so far recovered RM28.93 billion and assets siphoned through the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is a national victory for Malaysia and we were one of the agencies involved in the 1MDB task force, apart from the Attorney-General’s Chambers, the Finance Ministry and the National Anti-Financial Crime Centre,” he was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam was speaking to the press after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) and Malaysia Institute of Accountants (MIA) at the MACC headquarters yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam pointed out that MACC and UiTM had been in discussion since last year, mainly on sharing the expertise from its Accounting Faculty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With this MoU, it is hoped that we can realise cooperation between UiTM and MACC in terms of negotiation services, development of training modules, anti-corruption awareness and education programmes as well,” he reportedly said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also hoped to further strengthen the UiTM governance and integrity agenda.

                The United States in early January joined India, Canada, Italy, Japan and other countries in taking new measures after Beijing's decision to lift stringent zero-COVID policies

                It required new air passengers, two years and older to get a negative result from a test no more than two days before departure from China, Hong Kong or Macao

                China was battered with a surge in COVID-19 cases after it abruptly abandoned its zero-COVID policy in early December, unleashing the virus on its 1.4 billion population

                The source told Reuters on Tuesday the CDC would keep that program, known as the Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance Program (TGS), which asks travellers to volunteer to help with early detection of new variants.

                On March 3, MAHB said that it would suspend its aerotrain operations at KLIA until further notice

            <p>
                The decision was made following a train that had halted mid-way on the tracks from KLIA’s main terminal building to the satellite building on March 1

                Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday interest rates are likely to rise more than previously expected as the central bank works to bring down inflation, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target

                The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level

                Millennials in their 30s have added over $3.8 trillion in debt to their accounts — and are missing their credit card and auto loan payments at startling rates as well, according to the New York Fed

                Liverpool can replace Roberto Firmino this summer by repeating Takumi Minamino's transfer to Anfield as the club's scouts keep a close eye on an exciting talent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But while Liverpool will have plenty of first-choice options, Firmino's departure will leave a vacant spot in the squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's also where Liverpool purchased from
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latest sensation in the Austrian Bundesliga doesn't play for Red Bull in Keito Nakamura and Liverpool should look to emulate their previous transfer for Takumi Minamino in order to bring him to the club and fill Firmino's void
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This would make him a smart choice for Liverpool
            </p>

                Liverpool can replace Roberto Firmino this summer by repeating Takumi Minamino's transfer to Anfield as the club's scouts keep a close eye on an exciting talent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But while Liverpool will have plenty of first-choice options, Firmino's departure will leave a vacant spot in the squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's also where Liverpool purchased from
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latest sensation in the Austrian Bundesliga doesn't play for Red Bull in Keito Nakamura and Liverpool should look to emulate their previous transfer for Takumi Minamino in order to bring him to the club and fill Firmino's void
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This would make him a smart choice for Liverpool

            <p>
                Instead, after nine days of no answer from Twitter as to whether or not he was still employed, Thorleifsson decided to tweet at Musk to see if he could catch the billionaire’s attention and get an answer to his Schrödinger’s job situation

            <p>
                “He is considering remaining at Twitter.” Thorleifsson did not immediately respond to a message for comment following Musk’s tweet

            <p>
                But it would have been nice to let me know!” he tweeted to Musk

            <p>
                Thorleifsson, who lives in Iceland, has about 151,000 Twitter followers (Musk has over 130 million)

                Instead, after nine days of no answer from Twitter as to whether or not he was still employed, Thorleifsson decided to tweet at Musk to see if he could catch the billionaire’s attention and get an answer to his Schrödinger’s job situation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Late Tuesday afternoon, however, Musk had a change of heart
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He is considering remaining at Twitter.” Thorleifsson did not immediately respond to a message for comment following Musk’s tweet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it would have been nice to let me know!” he tweeted to Musk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thorleifsson, who lives in Iceland, has about 151,000 Twitter followers (Musk has over 130 million)

                This after several Perikatan Nasional MPs slammed Rafizi for allegedly going against his previous stand that a prime minister should not be holding the finance portfolio, and to the extent of filing a private member's bill to oppose such a move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi however said that good governance was not just whether the prime minister was holding the finance portfolio, but there was actually a whole system that needed to be looked at
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "What needs to be looked at is what are the steps that have been taken which shows the leanings of the prime minister," Rafizi said in his winding up speech for his ministry on the Budget 2023 debates in Parliament on Wednesday (March 8)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin (PN-Putrajaya) and Mohd Syahir Che Sulaiman (PN-Bachok) pointed out that Rafizi had used to criticise such a practice, especially during former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s administration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said it was different under Anwar, as there was no interference with enforcement bodies, which was already different from Najib’s tenure as prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also pointed out that the prime minister had cancelled all projects awarded under direct negotiation and re-tendered them for open tender

            <p>
                This after several Perikatan Nasional MPs slammed Rafizi for allegedly going against his previous stand that a prime minister should not be holding the finance portfolio, and to the extent of filing a private member's bill to oppose such a move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi however said that good governance was not just whether the prime minister was holding the finance portfolio, but there was actually a whole system that needed to be looked at
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "What needs to be looked at is what are the steps that have been taken which shows the leanings of the prime minister," Rafizi said in his winding up speech for his ministry on the Budget 2023 debates in Parliament on Wednesday (March 8)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin (PN-Putrajaya) and Mohd Syahir Che Sulaiman (PN-Bachok) pointed out that Rafizi had used to criticise such a practice, especially during former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s administration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said it was different under Anwar, as there was no interference with enforcement bodies, which was already different from Najib’s tenure as prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also pointed out that the prime minister had cancelled all projects awarded under direct negotiation and re-tendered them for open tender

                Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said Najib is not allowed to use a laptop or access the internet while in Kajang Prison, but suggested that it was still possible for him to post social media posts through his social media team doing so on his behalf as long as they are able to access his social media accounts

                Addressing over 100 diplomatic officers here on Tuesday (March 7), Anwar appeared unperturbed by PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang's claims of toppling the current government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abdul Hadi reportedly said that no parties would be able to stop Perikatan Nasional's plans to topple the government, saying that politics is dynamic and that such practice is considered normal in a democratic country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the session, Anwar said in order to bring the country to its past glory, Malaysians, including government officers, must not only uphold good governance but must be ready to make changes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We must do this and affect this change, which is extremely necessary to save this country from the mess that we have been in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar called on the heads of diplomatic missions to do better for the country, and it was vital for Malaysian officers and diplomats overseas to set an example of what it meant to be a good competent leader

                Recently, a claim was made online that a third wave of flooding in Johor will be caused by dams releasing water to prevent instabilities
            </p>

            <p>
                The department said that the public could refer to the publicinfobanjir.water.gov.my website for the latest information on the floods.

                The mint said, in September 2021, it was made aware that some of its 1kg bars may not have met the non-gold specifications of the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) - referring to the amount of components such as silver that make up 0.01 per cent of each gold bar, or 100 parts per million (ppm)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As per the SGE specifications, the non-gold component should contain no more than 50 ppm silver, it said

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Mar 7 — Datuk Seri Najib Razak told the sessions court here today that former federal territories deputy minister Edmund Santhara Kumar should not have travelled to New Zealand when Malaysia was under a movement control order (MCO)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prabakaran — said it was “morally wrong” for Edmund to take a 55-day trip abroad when others in Malaysia could not cross its borders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his lawsuit, Santhara claim that during a press conference on March 17, 2021, Prabakaran made allegedly false statements about the former’s trip to New Zealand in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During cross-examination, Santhara’s lawyer, N Krishnan, then reportedly put forth to Najib that Santhara’s trip to New Zealand was not unlawful as it was approved by the then prime minister, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib replied that the trip should not have been approved in the first place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In March 2021, Edmund stated that he left for his 55-day trip to New Zealand on December 23, 2020, in order to take a break and be with his family after not missing a day of work for a year, and partially because his wife was ill

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Mar 7 — Datuk Seri Najib Razak told the sessions court here today that former federal territories deputy minister Edmund Santhara Kumar should not have travelled to New Zealand when Malaysia was under a movement control order (MCO)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prabakaran — said it was “morally wrong” for Edmund to take a 55-day trip abroad when others in Malaysia could not cross its borders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his lawsuit, Santhara claim that during a press conference on March 17, 2021, Prabakaran made allegedly false statements about the former’s trip to New Zealand in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During cross-examination, Santhara’s lawyer, N Krishnan, then reportedly put forth to Najib that Santhara’s trip to New Zealand was not unlawful as it was approved by the then prime minister, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib replied that the trip should not have been approved in the first place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In March 2021, Edmund stated that he left for his 55-day trip to New Zealand on December 23, 2020, in order to take a break and be with his family after not missing a day of work for a year, and partially because his wife was ill

            <p>
                “And not to mention, the unity government already has a two-thirds majority in Parliament

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohammad Agus, who was appointed to his current position by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim last month, was responding to a statement by Hadi last week where the latter announced a prediction that the current government would collapse soon
            </p>

                Newcastle are reportedly keeping tabs on Arsenal's Kieran Tierney ahead of a summer move Eddie Howe's side are likely to continue spending after an impressive Premier League season It's unclear if Arsenal would be willing to part ways with Tierney at this stage

                The Scot signed a five-year contract in 2021, meaning Arsenal are under no pressure to sell

                Tierney has found minutes limited at Arsenal with Mikel Arteta's side chasing the league title But the success of Zinchenko and Arsenal's fine form have resulted in manager Mikel Arteta regularly naming an unchanged side

                Kim Yo-jong (pic) said North Korea is monitoring the "restless military moves by the US forces” and its South Korean "puppet military,” adding Pyongyang is "on standby to take appropriate, quick and overwhelming action at any time according to our judgment,” the official Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday (March 7)
            </p>

                The latest comments indicate North Korea could ramp up provocations in conjunction with the drills, with Kim last month threatening to turn the Pacific Ocean into a "firing range” if they went ahead

                The US and South Korea are set to hold their Freedom Shield exercises from March 13-23, drills designed to bolster their defenses against North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats

            <p>
                The last time North Korea launched a missile into the Pacific was October 2022, when it fired a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan, flying about of 4,600km (2,860 miles), and marking the longest distance traveled by a North Korean missile to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The drills had been scaled down or halted under former President Donald Trump, who was hoping the move would facilitate his nuclear negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un

                Ukrainian service members ride atop of a tank outside of the frontline town of Bakhmut, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Donetsk region, Ukraine, on Mar 4, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The eastern Ukrainian city has been badly damaged during the longest and bloodiest battle since Russia's more than year-long invasion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Outside Bakhmut, some Ukrainian soldiers had lost hope that Kyiv would hold the city and looked set to retreat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Ukrainian army said on Sunday that its troops had fought off "more than 130" Russian attacks in a single day around Bakhmut and said Moscow's forces were trying to encircle the city
            </p>
            
            <p>
                About 4,500 civilians remain in Bakhmut, Ukrainian officials have said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                South of Bakhmut, Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu visited Mariupol, the port city that Moscow captured after a long siege last Spring

            <p>
                The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner said the latest to be recovered was US$1.8bil (RM8bil) following a settlement with International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) and Aabar Investments PJS (Aabar PJS)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MACC, especially its Anti-Money Laundering division, has played an important part throughout efforts to recover such assets, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Efforts to recover the remaining assets and funds are still ongoing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We are doing our best to recover as much of the funds as possible," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is not investment," he said during the Prime Minister's Department monthly assembly on Monday

                The 7-0 hammering of Manchester United will echo for decades but Jurgen Klopp's focus has now moved to Saturday lunchtime's trip to Bournemouth as they look to continue their push for the top four

                In midfield, there are strong claims for Stefan Bajcetic to return to the side after his encouraging cameo off the bench on Sunday but it would seem harsh to drop out any of the three who started on Sunday, with Harvey Elliott, in particular, turning in one of his best performances as a Liverpool player

                Curtis Jones and James Milner came off the bench on Sunday but with the Reds engine room purring like never before this season, it would seem strange for Klopp to make any major changes for this trip to Gary O'Neil's side

                Roberto Firmino, who is entering the final months of his eight-year spell at Liverpool, did score from the bench against United, of course, but it seems likely that the Brazil international is likely to continue his role as deputy for now as the Reds head down south in a rich vein of form by this season's standards

                Speaking at the ministry’s monthly assembly here on Tuesday (March 7), Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said staff of the ministry should carry out their tasks strictly including terms of procurement and distribution of allocation

                Speaking at the ministry’s monthly assembly here on Tuesday (March 7), Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said staff of the ministry should carry out their tasks strictly including terms of procurement and distribution of allocation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The ministry needs to be feared because of its strict governance," he added

                Also present at the assembly were Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan and Treasury secretary-general Datuk Johan Mahmood @ Johan Mahmood Merican

                Cody Gakpo is expected to become the new Roberto Firmino for Liverpool, but another man could also shoulder much of the workload as Jürgen Klopp's 'connector'
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Firmino is almost a midfielder by nature

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! The Dutchman is a work in progress as Firmino's heir, but he could be helped in his quest by another Reds player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday afternoon, Klopp offered an insight into a second player who could shoulder much of the load as Liverpool guards against the loss of their special number nine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his reasoning, Klopp labeled the young starlet as a 'connecting player', which could be associated with Firmino's 'connector' tag
            </p>

                Elliott also ranked second for progressive passes received, behind only Salah

                SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Rivian Automotive plans to sell bonds worth $1.3 billion, it said on Monday, as weakening demand and lofty costs tighten a cash crunch around electrical vehicle makers

                Liverpool have learned how much it will cost to sign James Maddison in the summer if he continues to reject Leicester City's attempts to renew his contract.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Football Insider, Liverpool will need to pay £60m-£70m to sign Maddison this summer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool's midfield is lacking a player like Maddison, who is a double threat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He can score and assist with equal efficiency and would give Jurgen Klopp a different attacking threat than what he currently has on offer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given the lack of a playmaker in Liverpool's traditional midfield three, it's difficult to predict how Klopp would use Maddison.

            <p>
                By netting his 128th and 129th league goals for Liverpool against United, Salah finally achieved his dream and, as implausible as it may first appear may have designs on catching the likes of Ian Rush and Roger Hunt — who scored 244 and 229 times, respectively — in terms of all-time league strikes

                The key will be to ensure that the team is set up to play to Salah's key attributes, as was the case for Liverpool against United, with Gakpo and Núñez both pressing Erik ten Hag's defenders relentlessly out of possession while Salah intelligently stretched their backline with his skillful dribbling, clever movement and eye for a through pass while in possession

            <p>
                When Salah scored his second goal of the night to overtake Fowler as Liverpool's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League, it felt as though he had achieved what he had set out to when he first signed for the club in 2017

                For those wishing to travel to Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan and Tawau in Sabah, a one-way ticket will cost RM249
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The travel period for the fixed fare flights is from April 19–21 and April 28–30

            <p>
                “We want to focus on not only transportation in the peninsula but also between the peninsula and Sabah and Sarawak as there is no other choice for that besides the mode of air travel,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said many Sabahans and Sarawakians work in the Klang Valley and Johor Baru so it is important to ensure that flight fares during festive seasons are not burdensome
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because of the dynamic pricing of flight fares, prices for flight tickets will rise in line with demand when festive seasons draw near, he explained

                For those wishing to travel to Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan and Tawau in Sabah, a one-way ticket will cost RM249
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The travel period for the fixed fare flights is from April 19–21 and April 28–30
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We want to focus on not only transportation in the peninsula but also between the peninsula and Sabah and Sarawak as there is no other choice for that besides the mode of air travel,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said many Sabahans and Sarawakians work in the Klang Valley and Johor Baru so it is important to ensure that flight fares during festive seasons are not burdensome
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because of the dynamic pricing of flight fares, prices for flight tickets will rise in line with demand when festive seasons draw near, he explained

                MANCHESTER UNITED reckon they can sign Harry Kane this summer, if Tottenham miss out on the top four

                Mbappe's name has been on everyone's lips in both Paris and Munich since the first leg three weeks ago

                In response to an oral question on the Parliament website today (March 6), the ministry said that the 3,227 one-off teachers included 2,621 permanent teachers and 606 teachers who were appointed on contract basis for placement in Sarawak

                This was in reply to a question from Ahmad Johnie Zawawi (GPS-Igan) on the number of one-off and contract teachers who did not report for work or had rejected the offer to teach in Sarawak and the steps taken by the ministry to fill the vacancies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the ministry, Sarawak-born teachers are given priority to be placed in the state based on vacancies available and subject options requirements

            <p>
                For professional development of new teachers, the ministry has implemented the New Teacher Development Programme to assist and enable new teachers to adapt to the school environment, culture and community

                In response to an oral question on the Parliament website today (March 6), the ministry said that the 3,227 one-off teachers included 2,621 permanent teachers and 606 teachers who were appointed on contract basis for placement in Sarawak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was in reply to a question from Ahmad Johnie Zawawi (GPS-Igan) on the number of one-off and contract teachers who did not report for work or had rejected the offer to teach in Sarawak and the steps taken by the ministry to fill the vacancies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the ministry, Sarawak-born teachers are given priority to be placed in the state based on vacancies available and subject options requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For professional development of new teachers, the ministry has implemented the New Teacher Development Programme to assist and enable new teachers to adapt to the school environment, culture and community

                Signed from Brentford in 2020 off the back of a 25-goal season in the Championship, the frontman scored a hat-trick against Liverpool in just his third Premier League game

            <p>
                A debut goal at Watford in 2017 set the tone, and the 32 league goals he scored that season remains a record for a 38-game Premier League campaign

                Signed from Brentford in 2020 off the back of a 25-goal season in the Championship, the frontman scored a hat-trick against Liverpool in just his third Premier League game
            </p>

            <p>
                A debut goal at Watford in 2017 set the tone, and the 32 league goals he scored that season remains a record for a 38-game Premier League campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has already bested his all-competitions record this season, though, and needs just three more to match his best single-season league return of 17

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 — Former finance minister Lim Guan Eng today said the Cabinet had backed him on three proposals rejected by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, after the latter claimed the DAP leader could not “do anything” without his approval as the prime minister then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This was done by me three times during my tenure as finance minister (2018-2020) in securing Cabinet approval over and above the strident objections of then prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad,” Lim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On each of the three occasions that Mahathir was overruled by Cabinet, he threatened to sack me for defying him on these three initiatives,” Lim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mahathir did not carry out his threat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In it, Dr Mahathir claimed DAP had not been able to control him when he was the seventh prime minister as he had been more powerful at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir went on to say, “Even Guan Eng had to ask for my permission before he wanted to do anything”

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 — Former finance minister Lim Guan Eng today said the Cabinet had backed him on three proposals rejected by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, after the latter claimed the DAP leader could not “do anything” without his approval as the prime minister then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This was done by me three times during my tenure as finance minister (2018-2020) in securing Cabinet approval over and above the strident objections of then prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad,” Lim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On each of the three occasions that Mahathir was overruled by Cabinet, he threatened to sack me for defying him on these three initiatives,” Lim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mahathir did not carry out his threat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In it, Dr Mahathir claimed DAP had not been able to control him when he was the seventh prime minister as he had been more powerful at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir went on to say, “Even Guan Eng had to ask for my permission before he wanted to do anything”
            </p>

                In his defence of the four assemblymen, Wan Saiful reminded that Penang’s former chief minister and DAP’s Bagan MP Lim Guan Eng, had on August 2022 said there was a need for the Penang state government to amend the State Constitution so that it is in line with the anti-party hopping law at federal level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “At the federal level, when an individual is sacked, or when a party leaves a coalition, that situation is not considered as party-hopping
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But the regulations in the Penang state government are not in-line with the aspirations at the federal level when two assemblymen in Penang from PN who never party-hopped, both contested under Bersatu, remained in Bersatu, but Bersatu left Pakatan Harapan (PH) and two more assemblymen were sacked from PKR, these two have never party-hopped as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The aspirations at the federal level have not been translated at the state level as the sacking and two more who remained in Bersatu has been considered as party-hopping in Penang,” he said expressing regret over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zulkifli and Dr Afif, who were both PKR members when they were elected, have since been sacked by the party while Khaliq and Zolkifly are still members of Bersatu, the same party they were part of during the 2018 state polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He cited Article 14A of the Penang Constitution, which stipulates that a member of the state legislative assembly shall vacate his seat if having been elected as a candidate of a political party, he resigns or is expelled from a party or having been elected otherwise than as a candidate of a political party, he joins a political party

                The Deputy Prime Minister said the Special Committee on Congestion at the Johor Causeway had agreed to the proposal in principle and the idea would be refined by the Home Ministry, as the secretariat of the special committee, before being tabled at the Cabinet meeting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fadillah said if the idea was accepted by the Cabinet, a technical committee would be formed to discuss the possibility of its implementation with Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It will ease movement of commuters between Singapore and Malaysia," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aside from that, Fadillah revealed that a total of RM190mil had been allocated by the Federal Government to implement short-, medium- and long-term initiatives including to improve facilities and ease congestion at the Johor Causeway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the proposed idea to form a single border agency, the matter would also be brought to the Cabinet for further direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fadillah said the initiatives to ease congestion had to be taken into consideration as the number of commuters at the Causeway was expected to increase.

                The Deputy Prime Minister said the Special Committee on Congestion at the Johor Causeway had agreed to the proposal in principle and the idea would be refined by the Home Ministry, as the secretariat of the special committee, before being tabled at the Cabinet meeting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fadillah said if the idea was accepted by the Cabinet, a technical committee would be formed to discuss the possibility of its implementation with Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It will ease movement of commuters between Singapore and Malaysia," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aside from that, Fadillah revealed that a total of RM190mil had been allocated by the Federal Government to implement short-, medium- and long-term initiatives including to improve facilities and ease congestion at the Johor Causeway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the proposed idea to form a single border agency, the matter would also be brought to the Cabinet for further direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fadillah said the initiatives to ease congestion had to be taken into consideration as the number of commuters at the Causeway was expected to increase.

                The first step the group has implemented was the migration from using SMS one-time password (OTP) to face verification, which it developed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Slightly different from face verification done by others in the industry, in which they use a device to recognise the customer’s face to log in or do transactions, ours will detect the face based on the ‘selfie’ the customer uploaded in our server, pre-registration,” Ni explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, transactions of a certain threshold or any abnormal activity and suspicious behaviour observed on a user’s account will be limited or blocked and an email alert will be sent to the users if the transaction is over the set limit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The third step is the TapSecure feature and authentication of electronic banking transactions, which is now restricted to one mobile device or secure device per account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “TapSecure is now a mandatory one-tap approval function to authenticate users’ transactions and ensures that only a user’s linked device can be used for the approval of transactions within the user’s eWallet account,” Ni shared
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Cooling-off means that when users log in to their eWallet from a new device with a less secure authentication method, it will trigger a set of risk-based conditions where the user will be limited for a certain number of top-ups or payments for up to 48 hours,” he added

                “Slightly different from face verification done by others in the industry, in which they use a device to recognise the customer’s face to log in or do transactions, ours will detect the face based on the ‘selfie’ the customer uploaded in our server, pre-registration,” Ni explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, transactions of a certain threshold or any abnormal activity and suspicious behaviour observed on a user’s account will be limited or blocked and an email alert will be sent to the users if the transaction is over the set limit

            <p>
                The third step is the TapSecure feature and authentication of electronic banking transactions, which is now restricted to one mobile device or secure device per account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “TapSecure is now a mandatory one-tap approval function to authenticate users’ transactions and ensures that only a user’s linked device can be used for the approval of transactions within the user’s eWallet account,” Ni shared
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Cooling-off means that when users log in to their eWallet from a new device with a less secure authentication method, it will trigger a set of risk-based conditions where the user will be limited for a certain number of top-ups or payments for up to 48 hours,” he added

                Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (pic) confirmed that he had not seen the letter from ROS regarding the approval of the additional motion of the Umno general assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Declining to comment further, Saifuddin said he would need time to “see” the letter in a few days

            <p>
                On Saturday (March 4) Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said the party had received a letter from Saifuddin on Friday (March 3) regarding the ROS decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said on Sunday (March 5) that Umno will publish the letter from ROS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said he would ask the party’s secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan to see to this so that all members are reassured over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid, who is also Rural and Regional Development Minister, said it is hoped that the ROS letter would bring to an end any polemic against the motion that was approved during the 2022 Umno general assembly in January this year

                seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The firm’s search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, A$200 million (US$135.36 million) underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the Malaysian government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful

                According to Touch ‘n Go eWallet, they’re now the first and so far only eWallet in Malaysia to meet BNM’s security requirements, four months ahead of the June 2023 deadline set by BNM
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For starters, they’ve implemented face verification as a method of authentication when Touch ‘n Go eWallet users log into their eWallet app, change their eWallet PIN, perform transactions or make payments with their eWallet as well as when they reload into their eWallet account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Touch ‘n Go eWallet is also restricting the authentication of electronic banking transactions to just one mobile device or secure device per account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Touch ‘n Go eWallet believes this will ensure only a user’s linked device can be used for approval of transactions involving the user’s eWallet accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This cooling-off period will last for 48 hours, and triggers whenever a user logs into their Touch ‘n Go eWallet account from a new device with a less secure authentication method
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You’ll be able to reach Touch ‘n Go eWallet’s scam hotline at +60350223888 and select ‘4’ for ‘fraud’ to make a report with the platform

                For starters, they’ve implemented face verification as a method of authentication when Touch ‘n Go eWallet users log into their eWallet app, change their eWallet PIN, perform transactions or make payments with their eWallet as well as when they reload into their eWallet account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Touch ‘n Go eWallet is also restricting the authentication of electronic banking transactions to just one mobile device or secure device per account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Touch ‘n Go eWallet believes this will ensure only a user’s linked device can be used for approval of transactions involving the user’s eWallet accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This cooling-off period will last for 48 hours, and triggers whenever a user logs into their Touch ‘n Go eWallet account from a new device with a less secure authentication method
            </p>

                You’ll be able to reach Touch ‘n Go eWallet’s scam hotline at +60350223888 and select ‘4’ for ‘fraud’ to make a report with the platform

                Earlier, Penang Deputy Chief Minister I Datuk Ahmad Zakiyuddin Abdul Rahman said the decision made in the state assembly was in line with Article 14A(1) of the Penang State
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If any question arises if a member of the state assembly has done so and a decision by the state assembly has been taken, it will be final," he said during the first day of the meeting held at the state assembly building in Light Street, George Town Penang on Monday (March 6)

            <p>
                Ahmad Zakiyuddin (Pinang Tunggal) said based on the decision by the Federal Court, Penang's anti-party hopping enactment is constitutional

                On Thursday (March 2), the High Court dismissed the four assemblymen’s application for an injunction to prevent the Penang state assembly from tabling a motion to vacate the seats until their appeal is heard

            <p>
                In 2020 the four assemblymen filed the suit to challenge the constitutionality of Article 14A(1) of the Penang State Constitution (PSC) and to stop their seats from being declared vacant, pursuant to Article 14A(1) but the Federal Court found that it was in line with the constitution

            <p>
                Plenty of talents still ply their trade in their home country, meaning there is the potential to pick up some bargains for Liverpool on the back of this competition

The Gambia's current generation has definitely been the best team of the tournament so far, and with the country on the rise, even the senior national team's manager admits, more and more scouts are coming to the country to find talent

                With such an exciting change going on in the country, Liverpool and FSG would be smart to set up a scouting base in the region, with an eye on the next Salah.

                The Gambia is a small country on the west coast of Africa next to Senegal, with a population of roughly two million people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's a small and proud nation, and it's a country which has grown in size in recent years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2021, the country's march to the semi-finals may have been a surprise but this time around, The Gambia has been even more impressive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Plenty of talents still ply their trade in their home country, meaning there is the potential to pick up some bargains for Liverpool on the back of this competition

                Ukrainian servicemen fire a 2S5 Giatsint-S self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops outside the frontline town of Bakhmut, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Donetsk region, Ukraine March 5, 2023

            <p>
                For its part, the Russian Defence Ministry on Sunday said Russian forces had hit a command centre of the Ukrainian Azov Regiment in southeastern Zaporizhzhia region

            <p>
                Volodymyr Nazarenko, a commander of Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut, said that there had been no order to retreat and "the defence is holding" in grim conditions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The situation in Bakhmut can be described as critical," Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said in a video commentary

                As a result, there is a shortage of housing stock.  These are worrying times for the country’s real estate market, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) predicting further rate hikes in the coming months, said observers.  In Sydney, for instance, higher interest rates have sent prices falling by between 10 and 15 per cent since property values peaked more than a year ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The rise in interest rates is also affecting the broader economy, adding to Australia’s cost of living woes and stoking fears of a possible recession if the conditions do not improve.  The central bank is taking much of the blame for initially suggesting that interest rates in Australia would not go up until 2024

            <p>
                Observers pointed out, however, that at the upper end of the property market, top-dollar homes with views, will continue to sell.  For example, a three-bedroom townhouse with its iconic views of the Sydney Harbour is tipped to fetch A$11 million (US$7.4 million) when it is put on auction soon.  A couple of years ago, it sold for about A$10 million (US$6.8 million)

            </p>
            
            <p>
                SMEE did not respond to a request for comment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                SMEE has not made any major advancements since, in part due to difficulties in procuring equipment from abroad, the engineer told Reuters

            <p>
                "Even if we could have built the machines, we wouldn't have known how to service and maintain them," the engineer said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The situation could be worsened for Chinese companies should Japan and the Netherlands agree with the United States to also restrict exports of chipmaking equipment to China

                Families of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously nine years ago, called on the government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane

            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane

                The firm's search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, US$135.36 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful

                Families of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously nine years ago, called on the government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane

            <p>
                The firm's search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, US$135.36 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful
