                The Singapore president noted that her visit will build upon the progress made during Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s visit in January, where both sides signed three Government-to-Government agreements to promote collaboration in the digital and green economies as well as cybersecurity

            <p>
                Halimah, 68, said this to Bernama ahead of her visit in an interview through email facilitated by the Singapore High Commission in Kuala Lumpur

            <p>
                In response to a question on how her visit could strengthen bilateral ties between Singapore and Malaysia, the President stated that she will meet with the Agong and other important Malaysian officials during her stay to assess "our complete bilateral agenda, explore new areas of cooperation, and reiterate Singapore’s abiding interest to develop a stable, win-win partnership with Malaysia for the long-term." She also pointed to the digital and green economies as well as cybersecurity as agreed earlier by both sides as areas that can be developed and explored further to expand bilateral collaboration and cooperation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To this end, she said during her visit, she will also be meeting Singapore and Malaysia business leaders from some of these sectors on what they can do together to support and facilitate their exciting projects and expansion plans in both countries

                The Singapore president noted that her visit will build upon the progress made during Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s visit in January, where both sides signed three Government-to-Government agreements to promote collaboration in the digital and green economies as well as cybersecurity

                Halimah, 68, said this to Bernama ahead of her visit in an interview through email facilitated by the Singapore High Commission in Kuala Lumpur

            <p>
                In response to a question on how her visit could strengthen bilateral ties between Singapore and Malaysia, the President stated that she will meet with the Agong and other important Malaysian officials during her stay to assess "our complete bilateral agenda, explore new areas of cooperation, and reiterate Singapore’s abiding interest to develop a stable, win-win partnership with Malaysia for the long-term." She also pointed to the digital and green economies as well as cybersecurity as agreed earlier by both sides as areas that can be developed and explored further to expand bilateral collaboration and cooperation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To this end, she said during her visit, she will also be meeting Singapore and Malaysia business leaders from some of these sectors on what they can do together to support and facilitate their exciting projects and expansion plans in both countries

                The volcano continued to spew hot ash and hot lava was visible today

            <p>
                Merapi also erupted last week, sending volcanic material 3,000 metres above the summit

                Volcanic ash rain blanketed at least eight villages near the volcano after last week’s eruption

                Volcanologists said last week the volcano is experiencing its most active phase since 2021

            <p>
                The volcano’s last major eruption in 2010 killed more than 300 people and forced the evacuation of some 280,000 residents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Merapi’s most powerful eruption since 1930 when about 1,300 people were killed

            <p>
                An eruption in 1994 left about 60 people dead

                five years with no election, many have become overaged

            <p>
                The Umno polls began on Feb 1 with the annual delegates conference and Umno divisional delegates elections, along with the election of Umno Supreme Council members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad said Umno Youth and Puteri also need to be given exposure and intensive training since they are among the party’s prime movers, in addition to having to be in sync with the machinery in managing the state polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Mohamad, who is also Umno’s election director, said they have yet to discuss the issue of seat distribution between BN and Pakatan Harapan (PH)

                Meanwhile, in PENANG, state Umno liaison committee chairman Datuk Musa Sheikh Fadzir said they would discuss with the state’s PH leadership about the distribution of seats after the Umno Division Committee election is over

                The two unemployed locals, aged 36 and 39 years old, respectively, were arrested at the Kota Kinabalu International Airport at around 8.20pm on Wednesday (March 15), while their accomplice, a 37-year-old, is on the run

            <p>
                He said the two suspects went to Selangor after that and had committed at least three house break-ins and thefts before returning to Sabah on March 15, where they were nabbed

            <p>
                “They have been working as a team together with the third suspect on the run,” he said, adding that the two arrested suspects are from Tuaran and Papar while the accomplice is from Darau, Menggatal

                The two unemployed locals, aged 36 and 39 years old, respectively, were arrested at the Kota Kinabalu International Airport at around 8.20pm on Wednesday (March 15), while their accomplice, a 37-year-old, is on the run

            <p>
                Kota Kinabalu OCPD Asst Comm Zaidi Abdullah said with their arrest, police have cracked at least seven theft cases in Sabah and Selangor that were committed recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the two suspects went to Selangor after that and had committed at least three house break-ins and thefts before returning to Sabah on March 15, where they were nabbed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They have been working as a team together with the third suspect on the run,” he said, adding that the two arrested suspects are from Tuaran and Papar while the accomplice is from Darau, Menggatal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the two nabbed suspects had previously been under police supervision in Penang and Perak for two years

            <p>
                ACP Zaidi said apart from the two suspects, the vehicle buyer has also been brought in to facilitate investigations to find out how far into these crimes he is involved in

                Former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces fraud charges over the collapse of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, arrives for a hearing at a federal court in New York on Feb 9, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a letter filed on Friday (Mar 17) night in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried's lawyer Christian Everdell said that both sides believed they were "close to a resolution" and expect to formally propose new restrictions by next week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kaplan's approval is needed to modify Bankman-Fried's bail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried's lawyers have said that their client was trying to help, not interfere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Friday's letter, Everdell also sought the judge's permission to let Bankman-Fried in the meantime use a laptop to access some FTX materials
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though the laptop would lack monitoring software or restrict Bankman-Fried's Internet access, a lawyer or paralegal would oversee his use and take the laptop away when Bankman-Fried finished with it, Everdell said.

                British citizens Lloyd George Bedwell, 48, and Roger Hoi Wing Hu, 46, pleaded guilty yesterday before Sessions judge Zulhazmi Abdullah after the two alternative charges were read to them in English by the court translator during the proceeding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was reported on Thursday that two other British nationals pleaded guilty at the Shah Alam Sessions Court to similar charges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They pleaded guilty to inducing a Scottish man, Ian Strachan, to transfer £121,200 (RM579,249) into a CIMB Bank account belonging to Premier Transfers Ltd for a non-existent investment scheme
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Peters was ordered to pay a RM180,000 fine and was sentenced to an additional 22 months’ imprisonment should he fail to pay the fine, while McNicholas was ordered to pay a RM140,000 fine and faces an additional 16 months’ imprisonment should he fail to pay.

                British citizens Lloyd George Bedwell, 48, and Roger Hoi Wing Hu, 46, pleaded guilty yesterday before Sessions judge Zulhazmi Abdullah after the two alternative charges were read to them in English by the court translator during the proceeding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was reported on Thursday that two other British nationals pleaded guilty at the Shah Alam Sessions Court to similar charges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They pleaded guilty to inducing a Scottish man, Ian Strachan, to transfer £121,200 (RM579,249) into a CIMB Bank account belonging to Premier Transfers Ltd for a non-existent investment scheme
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Peters was ordered to pay a RM180,000 fine and was sentenced to an additional 22 months’ imprisonment should he fail to pay the fine, while McNicholas was ordered to pay a RM140,000 fine and faces an additional 16 months’ imprisonment should he fail to pay.

                Dividend stocks are the Swiss army knives of the stock market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When dividend stocks go up, you make money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Heck, even when a dividend stock goes down in price, it’s not all bad news, because the dividend yield (the absolute dividend amount, divided by the stock price) gets richer the more the stock falls in price
            </p>

                Yesterday, a local media outlet reported that Mohamad Kamal claimed that Hannah used her minsterial powers to deny Kelantan the right to host 2024 Sukma
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kelantan is the only state that has yet to host Sukma
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The decision to make Kelantan the 2028 Sukma hosts is to give the state government additional time to complete sports infrastructure for the Games,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also conveyed his appreciation to Sarawak, who are ready to organise the 2024 Sukma following Johor’s decision to not host the Games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johor was supposed to host the 2020 edition, but it was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the state chose to host the 2024 edition, followed by the 2026 edition in Kelantan, while the NSC would host the 2022 edition in the Klang Valley last September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the latest decision by the Sukma Supreme Council has determined that Sarawak will host the 2024 edition, the NSC the 2026 edition, followed by Kelantan in 2028

                Yesterday, a local media outlet reported that Mohamad Kamal claimed that Hannah used her minsterial powers to deny Kelantan the right to host 2024 Sukma
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kelantan is the only state that has yet to host Sukma
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The decision to make Kelantan the 2028 Sukma hosts is to give the state government additional time to complete sports infrastructure for the Games,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also conveyed his appreciation to Sarawak, who are ready to organise the 2024 Sukma following Johor’s decision to not host the Games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johor was supposed to host the 2020 edition, but it was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the state chose to host the 2024 edition, followed by the 2026 edition in Kelantan, while the NSC would host the 2022 edition in the Klang Valley last September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the latest decision by the Sukma Supreme Council has determined that Sarawak will host the 2024 edition, the NSC the 2026 edition, followed by Kelantan in 2028

                The Thai Rice Exporter Association recently raised concerns and demanded solutions after a rice mill in China was found to be producing fake jasmine rice and using a Thai brand name to deceive customers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The President of the Thai Rice Exporter Association, Chukiat Opassawong, revealed in an interview with KhaoSod that the rice mill in China had been producing fake Thai jasmine rice by adding a flavouring agent and using Thai language on the packaging and branding

            <p>
                Thai jasmine rice, also known as Thai Hom Mali rice, is a type of long-grain rice that is considered one of the best in the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the World’s Best Rice event in Phuket last year, Paka Lamduan rice from Cambodia was named the world’s best rice in 2022, defeating Thai jasmine rice, which came in second place, followed by rice from Vietnam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a report on WorkPoint Today, the judge, an American chef, noted that both Thai and Cambodian rice had good qualities, but Cambodian rice offered a better aroma than Thai rice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Thai customers and farmers expressed concerns that the quality of Thai jasmine rice had declined due to the use of pesticides and chemical substances

                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa said that the 150-year-old hospital accommodates about 50,000 inpatient services at its wards each year, which reflects the commitment of its staff

                It is revealed during the briefing by HKL director Datin Paduka Dr Rohana Johan that the hospital still relies on the manual method to store about 16,000 patients' data in a day, which is stored at its Wisma Kayu

                More info Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has been urged to replace Wout Weghorst with Victor Osimhen this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United are set to be in the market for a striker this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tottenham's Harry Kane is a top target for Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Osimhen has been on fire for Napoli this season and is another target for United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At 24, he would be a longer-term option for United than 29-year-old Kane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst, meanwhile, turns 31 later this year

                More info Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has been urged to replace Wout Weghorst with Victor Osimhen this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United are set to be in the market for a striker this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tottenham's Harry Kane is a top target for Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Osimhen has been on fire for Napoli this season and is another target for United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At 24, he would be a longer-term option for United than 29-year-old Kane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst, meanwhile, turns 31 later this year

                According to the charge sheet, Bedwell and Hoi had cheated an Austrian, Trevor Ronald John Curtis, into handing them A$8,991.92 (RM27,044) by promising a high profit in a short period of time through the purchase of shares in Devon Energy Corporation

                Once a victim shows interest, the caller will send an email containing a fake prospectus with details of the company and if the victim agrees to purchase the “shares”, the caller will provide a bank account number for the victim to submit payment for the purchase of the shares

            <p>
                Bedwell, with Yazdi, contacted Walker on January 5 this year where she was similarly scammed into transferring A$8,573 into the same bank account number

            <p>
                The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) conducted an operation on February 21 at several of the boiler rooms in Penang and Klang Valley where Bedwell and Hoi were arrested

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, March 17 — Crystal Palace sacked manager Patrick Vieira after 20 months in charge today after their 1-0 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion left them three points above the Premier League relegation zone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Palace are the only side in the league without a win in 2023, having drawn five and lost six of their games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Results in recent months have placed us in a precarious league position and we felt a change is necessary to give us the best chance of retaining Premier League status.” Former France international Vieira, who captained Arsenal to three league titles and four FA Cups as a player, took over from Roy Hodgson in July 2021 on a three-year contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wednesday’s defeat at Brighton was their third in a row and marked the 13th league game they failed to score
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Patrick has given his all to the club, and we all thank him and his team for their service.” Vieira also won the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European Championship as a player with France
            </p>

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, March 17 — Crystal Palace sacked manager Patrick Vieira after 20 months in charge today after their 1-0 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion left them three points above the Premier League relegation zone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Palace are the only side in the league without a win in 2023, having drawn five and lost six of their games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Results in recent months have placed us in a precarious league position and we felt a change is necessary to give us the best chance of retaining Premier League status.” Former France international Vieira, who captained Arsenal to three league titles and four FA Cups as a player, took over from Roy Hodgson in July 2021 on a three-year contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wednesday’s defeat at Brighton was their third in a row and marked the 13th league game they failed to score
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Patrick has given his all to the club, and we all thank him and his team for their service.” Vieira also won the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European Championship as a player with France
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The club did not confirm who would replace Vieira or take charge of Sunday’s Premier League trip to leaders Arsenal

                China's central bank said on Friday it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the first time this year to help keep liquidity ample and support a nascent economic recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for all banks, except those that have implemented a 5% reserve ratio, by 25 basis points (bps), effective March 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank said the cut reflected its intention to "make a good combination of macro policies, improve the level of services for the real economy, and keep liquidity reasonably sufficient in the banking system." The central bank has promised to make its policy "precise and forceful" this year to support the economy, keeping liquidity reasonably ample and lowering funding costs for businesses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The weighted average RRR for financial institutions stood at around 7.6% after the cut, the central bank said

                “Therefore, I wish to ask if this enactment will be applied on the country’s key leaders also if they visit these houses of worship? “As Muda president, I wish to call more than 100,000 Muda members to visit any houses of worship

                Syed Saddiq said that as an MP, he has also visited non-Muslim houses of worship because he represents everyone in his Johor constituency and does not look at their race, religion or political affiliations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syed Saddiq also noted that Mohd Zawawi had highlighted that the Selangor Islamic Religious Department (Jais) would take action on anyone who breaches the rules under Sections 5 and 6 of a 1988 Selangor state law and saying that the rules prohibit “any programme” involving Muslims at non-Muslims house of worship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Therefore, I wish to ask if this enactment will be applied on the country’s key leaders also if they visit these houses of worship? “As Muda president, I wish to call more than 100,000 Muda members to visit any houses of worship
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                For Selangor’s Non-Islamic Religions (Control of Propagation Amongst Muslims) Enactment 1988 which Mohd Zawawi referred to, Section 5 covers the offence of subject a Muslim minor to influences of a non-Islamic religion — including by persuading, influencing or encouraging the receiving of instruction in any non-Islamic religion or taking part in any non-Islamic religion’s religious activity or act of worship or taking part in any activity for the benefit of a non-Islamic religion organised by non-Islamic religion bodies or institutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Section 6 covers the offence of approaching a Muslim to subject him to any speech on or display of any matter concerning a non-Islamic religion

                “Malaysia wishes to note that the stay order granted on July 12, 2022, is an exceptional decision and serves to reinforce Malaysia’s position that the purported commercial arbitration instituted by the Sulu claimants is without legitimate basis and does affect Malaysia’s territorial sovereignty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In February last year, the Paris Court of Arbitration through arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa ordered Malaysia to pay US$14.9bil to the self-proclaimed heirs of the Sulu Sultanate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stampa, who was stopped by Spanish courts from hearing the case, had moved the arbitration to Paris to make his decision in Paris
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Malaysia managed to obtain a stay order on Stampa’s controversial award from French courts after filing a request for a stay of the enforcement of the purported final award in April 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Subsequently, on July 12, 2022, the pre-trial judge of the Paris Court of Appeal ordered the unconditional stay of enforcement in France of the purported final award pending the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal on the set-aside proceedings, on the ground that it will likely affect Malaysia’s territorial sovereignty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 27, 2022, the Sulu claimants filed a challenge against the stay order, to which the hearing on the merits was held on Jan 16, 2023.

                The beating heart of both the GLA 35 and GLB 35 is the manufacturer’s 2.0 litre inline-four turbocharged petrol engine that produces 306 PS at 5,800 rpm and 400 Nm of torque from 3,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm, powering all four wheels via the eight-speed AMG Speedshift dual-clutch automatic transmission and AMG Performance 4Matic variable all-wheel-drive

            <p>
                Rolling stock for the AMG GLA 35 and GLB 35 models is a 19-inch, 19-spoke alloy wheel design in a matte black and turned surface finish as standard; optionally available are two 20-inch five-spoke alloy wheel designs, which are also in a two-tone matte black and turned surface finish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Inside, the GLA 35 and GLB 35 are identified by AMG-specific equipment, such as the AMG Performance multi-function steering wheel that comes standard on both models, with key driving functions accessible from the steering wheel controls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The GLA 35 and GLB 35 also benefit from the latest updates to the MBUX interface, including mini-games which are offered on the interface of the regular models, which are finished in on-screen themes that are AMG-specific
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Upholstery in the GLA 35 and GLB 35 now feature Artico synthetic leather in a sage grey and black colour combination, while a pepper red and black combination is also available for leather upholstery in the AMG GLA and GLB for the first time, both of which get sports seats as standard

                The beating heart of both the GLA 35 and GLB 35 is the manufacturer’s 2.0 litre inline-four turbocharged petrol engine that produces 306 PS at 5,800 rpm and 400 Nm of torque from 3,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm, powering all four wheels via the eight-speed AMG Speedshift dual-clutch automatic transmission and AMG Performance 4Matic variable all-wheel-drive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rolling stock for the AMG GLA 35 and GLB 35 models is a 19-inch, 19-spoke alloy wheel design in a matte black and turned surface finish as standard; optionally available are two 20-inch five-spoke alloy wheel designs, which are also in a two-tone matte black and turned surface finish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Inside, the GLA 35 and GLB 35 are identified by AMG-specific equipment, such as the AMG Performance multi-function steering wheel that comes standard on both models, with key driving functions accessible from the steering wheel controls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The GLA 35 and GLB 35 also benefit from the latest updates to the MBUX interface, including mini-games which are offered on the interface of the regular models, which are finished in on-screen themes that are AMG-specific
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Upholstery in the GLA 35 and GLB 35 now feature Artico synthetic leather in a sage grey and black colour combination, while a pepper red and black combination is also available for leather upholstery in the AMG GLA and GLB for the first time, both of which get sports seats as standard

                banker Roger Ng (pic), who was sentenced to 10 years in prison last week for his role in the 1MDB fraud, is claiming he can’t meet US prosecutors’ demand that he also pay US$35mil (RM157mil) because the Malaysian government already took all of his money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Federal prosecutors had asked US District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn, New York, to order Ng to forfeit that amount as ill-gotten gains from the conspiracy to loot the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund at his March 9 sentencing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Brodie didn’t rule on the forfeiture issue last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though Agnifilo said there were other grounds to deny the US forfeiture demand, he also said it violated the Eighth Amendment

            <p>
                His former Goldman boss and 1MDB co-conspirator, Tim Leissner, previously pleaded guilty and was the government’s star witness against Ng

                banker Roger Ng (pic), who was sentenced to 10 years in prison last week for his role in the 1MDB fraud, is claiming he can’t meet US prosecutors’ demand that he also pay US$35mil (RM157mil) because the Malaysian government already took all of his money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Federal prosecutors had asked US District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn, New York, to order Ng to forfeit that amount as ill-gotten gains from the conspiracy to loot the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund at his March 9 sentencing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Brodie didn’t rule on the forfeiture issue last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though Agnifilo said there were other grounds to deny the US forfeiture demand, he also said it violated the Eighth Amendment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His former Goldman boss and 1MDB co-conspirator, Tim Leissner, previously pleaded guilty and was the government’s star witness against Ng

                The Terengganu Election Court was yesterday scheduled to continue hearing Mohd Nor testify in a case involving Terengganu Umno’s election petition, which sought to annul the 15th general election (GE15) result where the Marang parliamentary seat was won by PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang

                But taking to Facebook yesterday afternoon to clear the air about the “sensational news” regarding him, Mohd Nor said he had cooperated with the law firm representing BN’s GE15 candidate for Marang and had testified in court on Tuesday afternoon

                housing market in 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first prediction is that mortgage rates could fall if the Federal Reserve backs off from future rate hikes, which Olsen writes "appeared imminent just weeks ago." Already, financial markets have pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.75%—down from last week's peak of 7.05%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the Fed doesn't issue a rate hike in March, some analysts think mortgage rates would sink even further
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For buyers shopping now—especially in high-priced areas—a sustained rate drop will be a welcome boost to affordability, but they should still plan on rate volatility." That said, if Silicon Valley Bank's collapse forewarns of a looming 2023 recession, Olsen writes the affordability gains from lower mortgage rates could be muted by economic pain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank, Olsen predicts, might mean more pain awaits tech-dominated housing markets like San Francisco, Boise, and Seattle

                The first prediction is that mortgage rates could fall if the Federal Reserve backs off from future rate hikes, which Olsen writes "appeared imminent just weeks ago." Already, financial markets have pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.75%—down from last week's peak of 7.05%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the Fed doesn't issue a rate hike in March, some analysts think mortgage rates would sink even further
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For buyers shopping now—especially in high-priced areas—a sustained rate drop will be a welcome boost to affordability, but they should still plan on rate volatility." That said, if Silicon Valley Bank's collapse forewarns of a looming 2023 recession, Olsen writes the affordability gains from lower mortgage rates could be muted by economic pain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank, Olsen predicts, might mean more pain awaits tech-dominated housing markets like San Francisco, Boise, and Seattle

                Thursday Mar 16, 2023  Credit Suisse said on Thursday it would borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence, after a slump in its shares had intensified fears about a global banking crisis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Switzerland's second-largest bank said it would exercise an option to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the central bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That followed assurances from Swiss authorities on Wednesday that Credit Suisse met "the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks" and that it could access central bank liquidity if needed

                The concerns about Credit Suisse added to broader banking sector fears sparked by last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, two US mid-size firms

                The National TVET Council chairman said the proposed starting salary was appropriate as TVET graduates are skilled workers who have undergone skill courses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said the minimum wage of between RM1,500 and RM2,208 was insufficient for TVET graduates

            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid, who is also Minister of Rural and Regional Development, added that the government wants to see the optimal effectiveness of TVET programmes in producing more skilled workers, especially with the coordination among 12 relevant ministries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the government had also decided that TVET students be given credit transfer flexibility to pursue a Bachelor, Masters or even doctorate degree

            <p>

            <p>
                “Pursuant to this, the proposed acquisition is value-accretive, as there will also be an immediate net unrealised fair value gain on the properties of approximately RM66.2 million to Sunway REIT,” said the REIT’s manager

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Pursuant to this, the proposed acquisition is value-accretive, as there will also be an immediate net unrealised fair value gain on the properties of approximately RM66.2 million to Sunway REIT,” said the REIT’s manager
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The REIT manager believes that the proposed acquisition will contribute positively to Sunway REIT’s earnings and DPU
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The proposed acquisition will also further strengthen Sunway REIT’s current position as the second largest listed Malaysian REIT based on property values as at Dec 31, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sunway REIT Management said that the proposed acquisition is expected to contribute positively to the earnings and earnings per unit of Sunway REIT mainly arising from the net unrealised fair value gain of approximately RM66.2 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sunway REIT closed unchanged on Thursday, at RM1.57 per unit, giving the REIT a market value of RM5.38 billion

                Judge Ahmad Murad Abdul Aziz in his decision on Thursday (March 16) said having read the affidavits and considered the submissions made, the companies failed to prove there are special circumstances for the court to grant the stay of the winding-up order issued on Jan 10, pending their appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The judge added that the court disagreed with the submission of the companies that the refusal in granting the stay would result in the appeal to be considered nugatory

                Credit Suisse shares were indicated at 2.18 Swiss francs ($2.16), up 26% from Wednesday's close
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stock fell by as much as 30% the previous day after Credit Suisse's largest backer said it could not offer any more financial assistance for regulatory reasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its statement early Thursday, Credit Suisse said it would exercise an option to borrow from the central bank up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That followed assurances from Swiss authorities on Wednesday that Credit Suisse met "the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks" and that it could access central bank liquidity if needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Analysts at JPMorgan said in a note that a takeover was the most likely scenario for Credit Suisse, especially by rival UBS

                Credit Suisse shares were indicated at 2.18 Swiss francs ($2.16), up 26% from Wednesday's close
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stock fell by as much as 30% the previous day after Credit Suisse's largest backer said it could not offer any more financial assistance for regulatory reasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its statement early Thursday, Credit Suisse said it would exercise an option to borrow from the central bank up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That followed assurances from Swiss authorities on Wednesday that Credit Suisse met "the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks" and that it could access central bank liquidity if needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Analysts at JPMorgan said in a note that a takeover was the most likely scenario for Credit Suisse, especially by rival UBS

            <p>

            <p>
                In a statement today by Malaysia's special secretariat dealing with the Sulu claimants' matter, it gave updates on Malaysia's success so far in getting the Paris courts to block the purported Sulu heirs from enforcing a US$14.9 billion arbitration award
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The secretariat explained that Malaysia had filed a request in Paris on April 15, 2022, for a stay of the enforcement of Stampa's purported US$14.9 billion final award, and had later succeeded in getting the stay order
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Sulu claimants on July 27, 2022 then filed a challenge against the stay order, and the Paris Court of Appeal had a hearing on this challenge on January 16 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the January hearing, the secretariat said the Paris Court of Appeal had dismissed the Sulu claimants' bid to enforce the US$14.9 billion award, by rejecting the Sulu claimants' bid to challenge the stay order
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The secretariat indicated the Paris Court of Appeal's July 2022 stay order is a recognition that Malaysia's sovereignty was affected by the Sulu claimants' purported arbitration

                LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) has been suspended from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) for two years over what the ABPI on Thursday described as "serious breaches" of its code of practice

                ABPI's statement linked to a website of a self-regulatory body run by the association that pointed to a complaint alleging that Novo Nordisk had sponsored courses on weight management on LinkedIn for health professionals, without making clear the company's involvement

            <p>
                Novo will subject to audits in 2023 and 2024, where it will need to show "clear, significant and sustained improvement" for the ABPI board to consider allowing the company to resume membership after the two-year suspension

                LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) has been suspended from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) for two years over what the ABPI on Thursday described as "serious breaches" of its code of practice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ABPI's statement linked to a website of a self-regulatory body run by the association that pointed to a complaint alleging that Novo Nordisk had sponsored courses on weight management on LinkedIn for health professionals, without making clear the company's involvement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Novo will subject to audits in 2023 and 2024, where it will need to show "clear, significant and sustained improvement" for the ABPI board to consider allowing the company to resume membership after the two-year suspension
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Novo is the market leader in the rapidly growing area of weight loss through medicinal treatment rather than only dieting or exercising

                The government's special secretariat to tackle the Sulu Sultanate's claims against the Malaysian government said that the Paris Court of Appeal had decided on Tuesday (March 14) that the challenge filed by the Sulu claimants is inadmissible

                The rout in its shares prompted the Swiss National Bank to throw a financial lifeline to the embattled lender, and Credit Suisse said on Thursday it intended to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the bank

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>

                dollar index was last 0.07% lower at 104.58, after jumping nearly 1% in the previous session

                Liverpool could look to infamous transfer flop Iago Aspas to find a 'cheap Jude Bellingham', one who is setting La Liga alight at the tender age of 20
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the case of one La Liga starlet, it is clear that he could be a solution

            <p>
                With at least four current Liverpool midfielders expected to depart Merseyside this summer, it is clear that Klopp will need fresh options at his disposal come the start of next season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, one name who has been linked with Liverpool in recent times is Jude Bellingham

                But in short, Veiga is already one of Europe's best attacking midfielders in terms of his output and it would not be a surprise to see one of the continent's top clubs swoop in to try and prize the youngster from Celta Vigo's clutches

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, March 16 — The latest round of job cuts at Meta have led some workers in the technology field here, including one Apple employee, to fear for their job security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking to TODAY on Wednesday (March 15), a 33-year-old contract worker with tech firm Apple said that although the company has assured the teams that there will not be job cuts, employees such as herself remain worried about their future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What workers say The contract worker from Apple’s office in Singapore said that the spate of layoffs in the industry have been “on everyone’s minds”, with their worries further exacerbated by Meta’s latest move
            </p>

                For example, machine learning developers would form the core team of a machine-learning company, or data scientists would form the core team of an artificial intelligence company

            <p>
                A TikTok employee in her 20s said that she was “not too worried” about her job security because she had “grown numb” to all the news about layoffs in the sector since late last year

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, had tried to ban TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by the courts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                CFIUS, a powerful national security body in 2020 had unanimously recommended that ByteDance divest TikTok
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TikTok and CFIUS have been negotiating for more than two years on data security requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It could give the Biden administration new ammunition in court if they sought to ban TikTok
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Madrid have now knocked Liverpool out of the Champions League in three consecutive seasons, including beating them in last year’s final
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the first leg, Madrid were lethal, with Vinicius Junior and Benzema netting twice each — neither had their shooting boots on in the Spanish capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the other end Madrid sliced open Liverpool but Toni Kroos could not find Benzema, back after missing the win over Espanyol in La Liga on Saturday with an ankle problem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Benzema is key to Madrid’s bid to lift the trophy for a sixth time in 10 seasons, if he can stay fit

                In the “People Power Under Attack 2022” report by global research collaboration CIVICUS Monitor, which tracks fundamental freedoms in 197 countries and territories, Malaysia is one of seven countries in the Asia region rated as having an “obstructed” civic space

            <p>
                The “obstructed” category is the middle grade for how well a country respects the freedom of speech, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association

            <p>
                Malaysia has been in the “obstructed” category since CIVICUS Monitor started releasing its annual report in 2017

            <p>
                Why is Malaysia's civic space 'obstructed'? Commenting on Malaysia's “obstructed” rating, CIVICUS Monitor said it had documented the continued use of restrictive laws to silence dissent in the country, as well as restrictions on protests and harassment of peaceful protesters

            <p>

            <p>
                CIVICUS Monitor noted that the police had last August also launched investigations on 13 protesters over the #ManaKapalLCS protest over the government's handling of the navy's littoral combat ship (LCS) project

                A reported Liverpool move to sign Josko Gvardiol could see Nat Phillips join West Ham United in the summer transfer window

            <p>
                According to a report from The Athletic, the 21-year-old RB Leipzig ace joining Liverpool will help West Ham get a deal for the 25-year-old Reds centre-back over the line in the summer transfer window

            <p>
                And with a Premier League move beckoning for the defender, West Ham fans will be keeping a keen eye on which club he joins in the summer transfer window… The Athletic reckon that the door could be open for the Hammers to sign the 25-year-old defender, if the Croatian ends up moving to Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moyes is a big fan of Phillips, and has tried to sign him on a few occasions previously

            <p>
                Li Huagang, chairman and president of Haier Smart Home, said that Haier Egypt Ecological Park aims to become a regional home appliance manufacturing base, which can provide products for markets in the Middle East, North Africa, as well as Eastern and Southern Africa

                Temkin cited studies by the Journal of American Medicine, Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, and International Journal of Epidemiology, which link the consumption of produce high in pesticide residue to increased risks of certain negative health impacts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group strongly recommends that consumers choose organic produce whenever possible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The risks associated with not eating enough produce far outweigh any concern associated with eating produce on the dirty dozen list," said Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN, LD, a registered dietitian on the Eat This, Not That! medical review board
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The term "organic" does not mean "pesticide-free," she noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For example, copper sulfate, a natural compound that is used on certain crops to ward off fungus growth, may be linked to liver damage when exposure is too high." According to Manaker, the amount of pesticide residue that is present on produce is probably too small to make a huge impact. "None of us are eating the amount of produce that would have a significant effect on our health—for example, a woman would need to eat over 400 strawberries every single day to reach the levels of pesticide residue associated with potential risks," she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "On the flip side, delicate produce, grown close to the ground, such as strawberries and spinach, are not as naturally protected and therefore tend to be sprayed with more pesticides." Nearly 65% of Clean Fifteen samples had no detectable pesticide residues, according to EWG

                Temkin cited studies by the Journal of American Medicine, Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, and International Journal of Epidemiology, which link the consumption of produce high in pesticide residue to increased risks of certain negative health impacts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group strongly recommends that consumers choose organic produce whenever possible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The risks associated with not eating enough produce far outweigh any concern associated with eating produce on the dirty dozen list," said Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN, LD, a registered dietitian on the Eat This, Not That! medical review board
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The term "organic" does not mean "pesticide-free," she noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For example, copper sulfate, a natural compound that is used on certain crops to ward off fungus growth, may be linked to liver damage when exposure is too high." According to Manaker, the amount of pesticide residue that is present on produce is probably too small to make a huge impact. "None of us are eating the amount of produce that would have a significant effect on our health—for example, a woman would need to eat over 400 strawberries every single day to reach the levels of pesticide residue associated with potential risks," she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "On the flip side, delicate produce, grown close to the ground, such as strawberries and spinach, are not as naturally protected and therefore tend to be sprayed with more pesticides." Nearly 65% of Clean Fifteen samples had no detectable pesticide residues, according to EWG

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, March 16 — The latest round of job cuts at Meta have led some workers in the technology field here, including one Apple employee, to fear for their job security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking to TODAY on Wednesday (March 15), a 33-year-old contract worker with tech firm Apple said that although the company has assured the teams that there will not be job cuts, employees such as herself remain worried about their future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What workers say The contract worker from Apple’s office in Singapore said that the spate of layoffs in the industry have been “on everyone’s minds”, with their worries further exacerbated by Meta’s latest move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, machine learning developers would form the core team of a machine-learning company, or data scientists would form the core team of an artificial intelligence company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A TikTok employee in her 20s said that she was “not too worried” about her job security because she had “grown numb” to all the news about layoffs in the sector since late last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                people will say, ‘Hey, they made the right decision’..

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking to TODAY on Wednesday (March 15), a 33-year-old contract worker with tech firm Apple said that although the company has assured the teams that there will not be job cuts, employees such as herself remain worried about their future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What workers say The contract worker from Apple’s office in Singapore said that the spate of layoffs in the industry have been “on everyone’s minds”, with their worries further exacerbated by Meta’s latest move

                For example, machine learning developers would form the core team of a machine-learning company, or data scientists would form the core team of an artificial intelligence company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A TikTok employee in her 20s said that she was “not too worried” about her job security because she had “grown numb” to all the news about layoffs in the sector since late last year

            <p>
                people will say, ‘Hey, they made the right decision’..

                The 1GW of electricity imports can power up to all households (about 1.4 million) for a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Energy Market Authority (EMA) said on Thursday that electricity retailer Keppel Energy has received conditional approval to import hydropower, solar and potentially wind power from Cambodia’s Royal Group Power Company via new subsea cables that would transmit the electricity over more than 1,000km
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Republic has a target of importing 4GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which will make up about 30 per cent of Singapore’s projected energy supply in the same year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The project with Cambodia would be supplemented by battery energy storage systems to store excess wind and solar power, as well as pumped storage hydropower, which acts like a giant battery to store power and release it when needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The project is expected to start after 2030
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noting that the project would be a significant milestone for Singapore’s electricity import target, EMA said it had preliminarily assessed the project to be technically and commercially viable, and it meets the agency’s carbon emission requirements

                Volkswagen says the ID.2all concept is as spacious as a Golf, but is an inexpensive as a Polo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for being as inexpensive as a Polo, Volkswagen expects a starting price of less than 25,000 Euros for the production Volkswagen ID.2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Germany, the Polo starts from 20,830 Euros, while the Golf starts from 31,145 Euros, so they’re right in the sense that a production ID.2 would be priced around a specced up Polo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen probably intends this to be a replacement for the Golf in an electric future, and to make the connection to the iconic nameplate they say they have given the ID.2 a C-pillar design that is a throwback to the iconic Volkswagen Golf Mk1

                In a town hall meeting involving the minister and the Central Agency for Application for Filming and Performance by Foreign Artists (Puspal), they also asked that approval of visas for foreign artistes be expedited

                “We need to have an ecosystem for culture, art, live events, and for comedy but someone needs to spearhead it.”   In Malaysia, Van Boonstra said, organisers must visit separate government agencies and departments to deal with each specific aspect of a concert, which added multiple layers of red tape to the application process

            <p>
                During the townhall session, other industry players also requested the government to consider waiving the 25 per cent entertainment tax for small-scale events, saying this would help spur the category here

                “I urge the government to remove the tax imposed on artists that are here to hold workshops, educate, or participate in exchange programmes because our art industry is still in a growing stage,” said Goh You Ping who represented the Reformartsi art group

            <p>
                On December 31 last year, Puspal issued a new guideline that prohibited large-scale concerts and live performances by international artists on the eve of and during Islamic public holidays unless allowed by the respective Islamic authorities.

                KUALA NERUS, 15 Mac -- Presiden UMNO yang juga Timbalan Perdana Menteri Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi menyampaikan ucapan pada Majlis Pengenalan Calon-Calon Naib Presiden dan Majlis Kerja Tertinggi (MKT) bagi pemilihan UMNO 2023-2026 di sebuah hotel hari ini.

            <p>
                According to Mohamed Azmin, most of the Malaysian companies involved in the aerospace industry were tier-one companies, and it would be very beneficial if the state government looked into helping companies that came under tier two and tier three

            <p>
                Mohamed Azmin said there was also a need to move from the SME development programme to the Industrial Technology Development Programme.

                Shares of Credit Suisse fell  more than 20 per cent on Wednesday  Even as financial markets across the world, particularly in the US, are still reeling under the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, a noted Wall Street analyst has predicted which bank is likely to collapse next

                Robert Kiyosaki, an investor, author, and Wall Street analyst who predicted the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, believes that Credit Suisse is on the verge of collapse

            <p>
                "The problem is the bond market, and my prediction, I called Lehman Brothers years ago, and I think the next bank to go is Credit Suisse, because the bond market is crashing," Fox Business quoted him as saying

                Paramilitary police officers stand guard in front of the headquarters of the People's Bank of China, the central bank (PBOC), in Beijing, China on Sep 30, 2022

                Reforms of problematic small and mid-sized financial institutions have made key progress and illegal financial activities have been curbed, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement after its annual meeting on financial stability

                The government has unveiled plans to set up a new regulator - the National Financial Regulatory Administration - which will take over some regulatory responsibilities, including overseeing financial holding companies and investor protection, from the PBOC

                When the respondents were asked to explain why they preferred to stay, researchers found that pricing and rental affordability in the private housing sector was a major factor — PPR dwellers have “extremely limited options” to buy or rent outside the social housing market because they cannot afford to

            <p>
                One of the major ramifications of having a private housing market that is mostly unaffordable is that more Malaysians, including those a bit better-off than current PPR dwellers, could be forced to rely on social housing in the future, when the objective of PPR housing was completely the opposite
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PPRs, a programme that combined two social housing projects launched in 2002, was meant to offer transitory shelter for urban squatters with the hope that they would eventually afford to own or rent homes in the private market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means a good social housing policy should provide decent lives and transition homes for the underprivileged, or security of tenancy and stability that supports a good quality of life, a platform to help the poor take up education or employment and facilitate a transition from social housing to affordable housing or tenancy in the private rental market

                About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, March 15 — The Election Court today struck out Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Masyarakat president Datuk Peter Anthony’s election petition against Tenom MP Reduan Rubin Balang for failing to prove there was any breach of procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Dean Wayne Daly ruled that Peter’s election petition did not comply with Rule 4(1)(b) of the Election Petition Rules, read with Section 32(b) of the Election Offences Act, and struck out the petition with costs of RM 20,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The judge had also ruled that Peter was a convicted criminal under Article 48(1)(e) at the time of nomination and was therefore disqualified under Article 48(5) of the Federal Constitution from contesting in GE15.” Peter is also Melalap assemblyman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Peter’s lawyer Datuk Ansari Abdullah, argued that Article 48(5) did not apply to his client because he had obtained a stay of conviction from the Sessions Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is irrelevant that there has been a stay of conviction because a stay only suspends the effects of conviction — it does not cause the conviction to disappear’ said Fuad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On November 5, a riot broke out at the nomination centre in Tenom after Peter’s nomination papers were rejected on Nomination Day for the 15th general election last year

                “We at the MoF are also examining the implementation of the Luxury Goods Tax which involves non-controversial goods such as gold for example, and how we can have mechanisms for foreign tourists such as rebates when they shop in Malaysia,” he told the media at KPMG's Tax and Business Summit 2022 today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johan said the model for the implementation of the Luxury Goods Tax expected to be introduced in the second half of this year will also be developed independently and not according to the model from foreign countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because it needs to take into account the type, price and suitability of the item with the conditions in this country to be considered a luxury item

            <p>
                He added that the Capital Gains Tax will be implemented in 2024 at a low rate as announced by Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim during the Budget 2023 presentation on Feb 24

                “We at the MoF are also examining the implementation of the Luxury Goods Tax which involves non-controversial goods such as gold for example, and how we can have mechanisms for foreign tourists such as rebates when they shop in Malaysia,” he told the media at KPMG's Tax and Business Summit 2022 today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johan said the model for the implementation of the Luxury Goods Tax expected to be introduced in the second half of this year will also be developed independently and not according to the model from foreign countries
            </p>

                This is because it needs to take into account the type, price and suitability of the item with the conditions in this country to be considered a luxury item

            <p>
                He added that the Capital Gains Tax will be implemented in 2024 at a low rate as announced by Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim during the Budget 2023 presentation on Feb 24

                This is a drop from the state’s record high approved manufacturing investments of RM76.2 billion in 2021, which accounted for 39 per cent of the country’s total at that time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing data from Malaysia Investment Development Authority (MIDA), it said foreign direct investments (FDI) accounted for RM9.7 billion or 71 per cent of Penang’s manufacturing investment inflows in 2022, while the remaining RM4 billion or 29 per cent were domestic direct investments (DDI)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With a 16 per cent share in Malaysia’s approved manufacturing investments in 2022, Penang is the second highest contributor among all states,” it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cumulatively, investments into these sectors accounted for 85 per cent of Penang’s total approved manufacturing investments in 2022, which is equivalent to 27 per cent of Malaysia’s investments in these three sectors

                This is a drop from the state’s record high approved manufacturing investments of RM76.2 billion in 2021, which accounted for 39 per cent of the country’s total at that time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing data from Malaysia Investment Development Authority (MIDA), it said foreign direct investments (FDI) accounted for RM9.7 billion or 71 per cent of Penang’s manufacturing investment inflows in 2022, while the remaining RM4 billion or 29 per cent were domestic direct investments (DDI)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With a 16 per cent share in Malaysia’s approved manufacturing investments in 2022, Penang is the second highest contributor among all states,” it said

            <p>
                Cumulatively, investments into these sectors accounted for 85 per cent of Penang’s total approved manufacturing investments in 2022, which is equivalent to 27 per cent of Malaysia’s investments in these three sectors

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 — The Malaysian government will give priority to reforming laws on bankruptcy to help Malaysians, instead of political financing laws which were more pressing during elections and should have been rolled out before the 15th general election (GE15) last November, minister Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said has said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azalina, the minister in the Prime Minister’s Department in charge of law and institutional reform, reportedly acknowledged the importance of laws on political funding and said such laws are on Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s radar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We need political financing laws during election time,” she was quoted as saying by news portal Malaysiakini in a joint interview with a few media organisations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was responding to a question on whether her priorities include political funding laws
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 6, Azalina had provided updates on law reforms that are being worked on with the aim to bring such changes as quickly as possible, including a planned Political Funding Bill which she said would be referred to a parliamentary special select committee once it is established and that this committee would then engage with members of Parliament on the Bill

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 — The Malaysian government will give priority to reforming laws on bankruptcy to help Malaysians, instead of political financing laws which were more pressing during elections and should have been rolled out before the 15th general election (GE15) last November, minister Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said has said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azalina, the minister in the Prime Minister’s Department in charge of law and institutional reform, reportedly acknowledged the importance of laws on political funding and said such laws are on Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s radar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We need political financing laws during election time,” she was quoted as saying by news portal Malaysiakini in a joint interview with a few media organisations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was responding to a question on whether her priorities include political funding laws
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 6, Azalina had provided updates on law reforms that are being worked on with the aim to bring such changes as quickly as possible, including a planned Political Funding Bill which she said would be referred to a parliamentary special select committee once it is established and that this committee would then engage with members of Parliament on the Bill

                An MACC source said it was believed the politician’s relative is not the first victim of the 54-year-old ‘Datuk Roy’ – real name Mohd Hussein Mohd Nasir – who was remanded yesterday
            </p>

                A check showed that back in 2020, a ‘Datuk Roy’ had also impersonated an MACC officer in Putrajaya to scam RM60,000 off a man who was being investigated

                Although reports showed that he was arrested and remanded by MACC then, there was no further report about him

            <p>
                On March 9, the MACC arrested four people, including an MACC officer and a woman, aged between 40 and 50, for allegedly soliciting and accepting bribes worth RM400,000 to halt an investigation into a Jana Wibawa-related case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The woman was released on MACC bail, while the other three remained in custody until March 13

            <p>
                An MACC source said it was believed the politician’s relative is not the first victim of the 54-year-old ‘Datuk Roy’ – real name Mohd Hussein Mohd Nasir – who was remanded yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A check showed that back in 2020, a ‘Datuk Roy’ had also impersonated an MACC officer in Putrajaya to scam RM60,000 off a man who was being investigated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although reports showed that he was arrested and remanded by MACC then, there was no further report about him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 9, the MACC arrested four people, including an MACC officer and a woman, aged between 40 and 50, for allegedly soliciting and accepting bribes worth RM400,000 to halt an investigation into a Jana Wibawa-related case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The woman was released on MACC bail, while the other three remained in custody until March 13

                Agriculture and Food Security Deputy Minister Chan Foong Hin said as the country’s main rice importer, Bernas needed to fulfil 10 social obligations without getting any grants from the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The obligations include managing the country’s rice buffer stock, maintaining its role as the last padi purchaser at a minimum price, and managing padi price subsidy payments as well as the scheme for millers, Bumiputera wholesalers and farmers’ cooperatives
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from this, Bernas also had to allocate funds for supply of machinery and padi mechanisation, development of large-scale padi farms and providing allocations for several programmes, including development of padi seed buffer stock, padi cultivation disaster fund aid and an information system on padi and rice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Furthermore, Bernas now also gives a cash contribution of RM60mil and shares 30% of its net profit from rice imports with farmers this year," he said when winding up the debate on the Supply Bill 2023 at the committee stage on behalf of the ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, several parties had questioned the extension of Bernas’ concession period as the country’s sole rice importer but the government stressed that it was necessary to ensure the commodity remains stable and under control

                As of December 2022, the average new car loan for a buyer with great credit was 8.6%, according to MyAutoloan

            <p>
                However, if you hold off on retirement to pay off these loans, putting aside wages to pay them down aggressively, you could be saving yourself thousands in interest while creating a cushion to retire on

                Therefore Cameco (CCJ) — a major uranium producer — is well-positioned if nuclear power becomes a more significant source of electricity production

                For instance, the VanEck Uranium+Nuclear Energy ETF (NLR) is an ETF that tracks the performance of companies involved in uranium mining, the construction, engineering and maintenance of nuclear power facilities, the production of electricity from nuclear sources, and providing equipment and services to the nuclear power industry

                The letter, seen by ESPN, was sent by FIFPRO to FIFA president Gianni Infantino in October, a month before the start of the men's 2022 World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also highlights how from the men's 2018 World Cup and 2019 Women's World Cup, female players earned just under 7% of what their male counterparts collected

            <p>
                FIFPRO is currently negotiating with FIFA on behalf of these players." Sources at FIFA told ESPN it is aware of the letter and an announcement will be made shortly on prize money at the Women's World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But we are all aligned with them, and we do have regular meetings with FIFPro and are on the same page with what they put out." A total of $440 million was allocated by FIFA as prize money at the men's World Cup, with Argentina collecting $42m for winning the tournament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2019, FIFA tabled $30m prize money for the Women's World Cup that year in France, with the USWNT taking home $4m

                The letter, seen by ESPN, was sent by FIFPRO to FIFA president Gianni Infantino in October, a month before the start of the men's 2022 World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also highlights how from the men's 2018 World Cup and 2019 Women's World Cup, female players earned just under 7% of what their male counterparts collected

                These players are seeking equitable conditions before the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup

            <p>
                FIFPRO is currently negotiating with FIFA on behalf of these players." Sources at FIFA told ESPN it is aware of the letter and an announcement will be made shortly on prize money at the Women's World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But we are all aligned with them, and we do have regular meetings with FIFPro and are on the same page with what they put out." A total of $440 million was allocated by FIFA as prize money at the men's World Cup, with Argentina collecting $42m for winning the tournament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2019, FIFA tabled $30m prize money for the Women's World Cup that year in France, with the USWNT taking home $4m

                The mild-hybrid line-up is made up of the GLC 200 4Matic, the GLC 300 4Matic, GLC 220d 4Matic and GLC 300d 4Matic, while the PHEV range consists of the GLC 300e 4Matic, GLC 400e 4Matic and GLC300de 4Matic

                The petrol mild-hybrid range is powered by a 2.0 litre inline-four cylinder petrol engine, which offers 204 hp at 6,100 rpm and 320 Nm of torque from 2,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm on the GLC 200

                On the GLC 400e, 252 hp and 400 Nm is available from the engine, and with the same output from the electric motor combined system output is 381 hp and 650 Nm

                The Women, Family and Community Development Ministry supports a proposed penalty for sending parents to care homes, despite having the means to care for them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 – The government announced today that it will introduce a Senior Citizens Bill in Parliament next year that may include penalties for people who send their elderly parents to care facilities or old folks’ homes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, for those who are unable to do so, the ministry has implemented various comprehensive initiatives to safeguard the welfare of elderly citizens in the country.” It is unclear what the parameters are for punishing those who “send their elderly parents to care centres” as some of these facilities provide specialised care and support that can be challenging to provide at home, especially for seniors with complex medical needs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If none could be located, the senior citizen would be placed in government or private welfare institutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, the ministry also has the Senior Citizens Activity Centre (PAWE), a place where the elderly can perform activities within the community, and the Senior Citizens Care Unit (UPWE), which provides transport services to the elderly who live alone or with families who cannot afford, to get medical attention at the hospital or clinic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deputy minister said the assistance has far benefited approximately 140,447 senior citizens

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, the Court of Appeal’s majority decision was also of the view that SIS Forum had failed to show that the 2014 fatwa issued by the Selangor fatwa committee was ultra vires or had gone beyond its powers under the 2003 Selangor law
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court decision which said the 2014 fatwa had not gone against the Printing Presses and Publications Act’s (PPPA) Section 7 and the Communications and Multimedia Act’s (CMA) Section 3(3)

            <p>
                The Court of Appeal said the High Court was not wrong to say that the 2014 Selangor fatwa only makes publications with liberalism and religious pluralism forbidden and does not give the Selangor fatwa committee to seize such publications, as the power to prohibit publications is still in the hands of the home minister
            </p>

            <p>
                In short, the majority decision in the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the civil High Court has no jurisdiction to hear and decide on SIS Forum’s challenge.

                But Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim’s decision to include Bank of America representatives in his party when it meets the Glazer family’s chosen selling agent, the Raine Group, appears a significant step

            <p>
                Both Sheikh Jassim and Sir Jim, Britain’s richest man, are believed to have put in initial bids at no more than £4.5billion for the club

                Football Insider reports one player who has caught their eye is Boca Juniors midfielder Varela
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Football Insider suggests Varela is ‘keen to land a move, especially to the Premier League’

            <p>
                What’s more, they state £16-20million would be enough to land him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Liverpool, a 21-year-old who won’t cost a bomb and is already being touted for success would be the perfect addition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, Varela would be perfect, and the Reds will hope they can land him and integrate him with their other young midfielders in the summer

                Football Insider reports one player who has caught their eye is Boca Juniors midfielder Varela
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Football Insider suggests Varela is ‘keen to land a move, especially to the Premier League’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s more, they state £16-20million would be enough to land him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Liverpool, a 21-year-old who won’t cost a bomb and is already being touted for success would be the perfect addition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, Varela would be perfect, and the Reds will hope they can land him and integrate him with their other young midfielders in the summer

                The census is important because it provides crucial data that gives business owners the power to make acurate decisions and spur innovation among small and micro firms, Rafizi said in a speech to launch the census at Sasana Kijang here

                “Second is that we hope this would boost innovation (among businesses) that is data-driven.” But ultimately the census will be most useful to policymakers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With the data from the census it gives us the ability to really understand the state of things..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If before data was just used to formulate policies, today we need the data to be more granular so that we can also determine the effectiveness as well as the equitability of a particular policy

                DOSM had previously charged a fee for the data but that changed after Rafizi took over the economy portfolio

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The census is important because it provides crucial data that gives business owners the power to make acurate decisions and spur innovation among small and micro firms, Rafizi said in a speech to launch the census at Sasana Kijang here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Second is that we hope this would boost innovation (among businesses) that is data-driven.” But ultimately the census will be most useful to policymakers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With the data from the census it gives us the ability to really understand the state of things..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If before data was just used to formulate policies, today we need the data to be more granular so that we can also determine the effectiveness as well as the equitability of a particular policy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DOSM had previously charged a fee for the data but that changed after Rafizi took over the economy portfolio

                Harris was the one who had filed the lawsuit in the High Court in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, to seek a court order to direct the Malaysian government to declassify its investigation report on the June 6, 1976 plane crash

            <p>
                On March 8, the High Court in Kota Kinabalu issued a court order to direct the Malaysian government to take the necessary steps to declassify or make public the Malaysian authorities’ investigation report on the “Double Six” incident involving a Nomad Aircraft 9M-ATZ plane with 11 people onboard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court had ordered the Malaysian government to comply with the order to declassify the report within three months or by June 8 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court also said that if such public disclosure of the investigation report requires any related action by the Australian government, the Malaysian government must immediately ensure the Australian government acts accordingly to enable the declassification to be done promptly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian government’s investigation team included the Department of Civil Aviation, the Royal Malaysian Air Force, the Royal Malaysian Police, while the Australian government also had a separate investigation team involving the aircraft’s manufacturer Government Aircraft Factory of Australia and the Australian Department of Transport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among other things, High Court judge Datuk Christopher Chin Soo Yin had in his March 8 decision said that it is in the public interest for the Malaysian government to declassify the investigation report

                The Carabao Cup is the least desired trophy in England but it's a trophy nonetheless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although supporters won't want to be reminded, at this stage of the season last year, United had been knocked out of the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Champions League, whilst they had just been defeated 4-1 by Manchester City in the league
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Carabao Cup has been won, whilst the FA Cup and the Europa League remain realistic avenues for more silverware, which means United have already played 41 matches - just eight fewer than they did during the whole of last season (49)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United have 12 matches remaining in the Premier League alone and they are going to end the campaign having played significantly more matches than they did last season

                The Carabao Cup is the least desired trophy in England but it's a trophy nonetheless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although supporters won't want to be reminded, at this stage of the season last year, United had been knocked out of the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Champions League, whilst they had just been defeated 4-1 by Manchester City in the league
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Carabao Cup has been won, whilst the FA Cup and the Europa League remain realistic avenues for more silverware, which means United have already played 41 matches - just eight fewer than they did during the whole of last season (49)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United have 12 matches remaining in the Premier League alone and they are going to end the campaign having played significantly more matches than they did last season

                The question is which hybrid system will it get? Toyota has a few different ways of building a hybrid system around its larger engines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However recently Toyota also introduced a different type of hybrid system built for the demands of a full sized truck, which is most likely what will be used in the LX 700h
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The system is called the i-FORCE MAX and made its debut in the Toyota Tundra pickup truck
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The i-FORCE MAX is a more traditional hybrid system in the sense that it puts a motor into a 10-speed transmission’s bell housing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the Tundra, the i-FORCE MAX engine + motor system produces 437 horsepower and 790 Nm of torque, compared to the non-hybrid version’s 389 hp and 649 Nm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no plug-in feature on the Tundra, so if the big Lexus shares the same system, it’s likely the LX 700h won’t have a plug-in feature either

                However recently Toyota also introduced a different type of hybrid system built for the demands of a full sized truck, which is most likely what will be used in the LX 700h
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The system is called the i-FORCE MAX and made its debut in the Toyota Tundra pickup truck
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The i-FORCE MAX is a more traditional hybrid system in the sense that it puts a motor into a 10-speed transmission’s bell housing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the Tundra, the i-FORCE MAX engine + motor system produces 437 horsepower and 790 Nm of torque, compared to the non-hybrid version’s 389 hp and 649 Nm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no plug-in feature on the Tundra, so if the big Lexus shares the same system, it’s likely the LX 700h won’t have a plug-in feature either
            </p>

                The programme seeks to enable participants to earn between RM2,000 and RM2,500 per month during the 24-month monitoring period and allow them to generate their income through the results obtained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Participants can apply to join the programme under several categories namely Agro Entrepreneur Initiative (Intan), Food Entrepreneur Initiative (Insan) and Services Operator Initiative (Ikhsan)

                Judge Datuk Christopher Chin Soo Yin handed down the sentence on Loi Kwong Kiat, 53, after ruling there was clear evidence that the accused had engaged in the sale of narcotics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They were charged under Section 39B(1) (a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act, punishable under subsection 39B(2) of the same Act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Act provides for the death sentence upon conviction or life imprisonment and whipping of not less than 15 strokes if not sentenced to death

            <p>
                In his ruling, Judge Chin said that by virtue of the Criminal Procedure Code, the court was obliged not to nit-pick the evidence adduced by the prosecution but to assess the case on the totality of the evidence

                Alejandro Garnacho could be set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines following a heavy tackle from Kyle Walker-Peters during Manchester United's draw with Southampton Manchester United have been rocked by the news that the injury Alejandro Garnacho sustained in Sunday's stalemate with Southampton is worse than initially feared

                Garnacho, 18, has made a big impression after breaking into the first-team picture under Erik ten Hag this season and even earned his first senior international call-up for Argentina last week

                Alejandro Garnacho could be set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines following a heavy tackle from Kyle Walker-Peters during Manchester United's draw with Southampton Manchester United have been rocked by the news that the injury Alejandro Garnacho sustained in Sunday's stalemate with Southampton is worse than initially feared
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Garnacho, 18, has made a big impression after breaking into the first-team picture under Erik ten Hag this season and even earned his first senior international call-up for Argentina last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Garnacho was in contention to win his first senior cap after the winger made the decision to represent Argentina over Spain

            <p>
                Despite his failure to make the world champion's squad, Garnacho has enjoyed a breakthrough season at club level

                About Us Advertise   BEIJING, March 14 ― China will once again start issuing a range of visas to foreigners as of tomorrow, the country's embassy in Washington said, a major easing of travel restrictions in force since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move marks the latest step towards reopening China to the outside world, as Beijing gradually breaks with the strict zero-Covid strategy that defined its pandemic response until a few months ago
            </p>

                China received 65.7 million international visitors in 2019, according to data from the UN World Tourism Organisation, before the pandemic led the country to seal itself off from the rest of the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beijing announced in late December that inbound travellers to the country beginning January 8 would no longer need to quarantine, but kept in place visa restrictions on foreigners

            <p>
                Li on Monday admitted that achieving the country's economic growth target of “around five percent” would be “no easy task.” China posted just three percent growth last year, missing its stated target of around 5.5 percent by a wide margin as the economy strained under the twin impact of strict Covid policies and a property crisis

                “With so much talent on display, this year’s MSC 2023 promises to be more inclusive than before,” Moonton wrote

            <p>
                Regions outside of Southeast Asia, such as Turkey, North America, and MENA, will be competing for the first time in MSC and will receive one slot each

                Last year, MSC 2022 was held in Malaysia with a live audience and a US$300,000 prize pool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tournament returned the year after with MSC 2021, which was held online for the first time in MSC history
