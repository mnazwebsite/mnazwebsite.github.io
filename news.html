                In its Updates on Economic & Fiscal Outlook and Revenue Estimates 2023 report released today, the ministry said of the amount, 74.8 per cent will be utilised for operating expenditure while the remaining 25.2 per cent is for development expenditure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                MoF said funding for Budget 2023 will be sourced from income tax totalling 39.9 per cent of the total allocation, borrowings and use of government’s assets (24.5 per cent), non-tax revenue (19 per cent), indirect tax (14 per cent) and other direct tax (2.6 per cent)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to MoF, the fiscal deficit is expected to consolidate further to 5.0 per cent of GDP, to -RM93.94 billion from -RM99.48 billion in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                MoF said in the report that growth in 2022 was anchored by the services sector, which grew by 10.9 per cent and contributed 58.2 per cent share to the GDP, mainly supported by the wholesale and retail trade, transportation and storage, as well as real estate and business services sub-sectors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The growth was also attributed to robust external demand, especially among Malaysia’s major trading partners, which resulted in a 27.8 per cent increment to RM2.848 trillion total trade last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, the trade surplus expanded by 0.6 per cent to RM255.1 billion

                Available as a fastback sedan or station wagon (508 SW), the French model comes in three trim levels – Allure, GT and Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) – and is offered with regular internal combustion engines as well as plug-in hybrid powertrains

                Peugeot’s new logo is front and centre on the revised front grille, which blends into the bodywork and slimmer matrix LED headlamps, the latter also sporting three fang-like running light strips progressing down the bumper

            <p>
                This setup is made up of a 1.6 litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine that works with two electric motors – one in the gearbox and another on the rear axle – to provide all-wheel drive

                Allure and GT models are offered with two front-wheel drive plug-in hybrid powertrains using the same battery and PureTech internal combustion engine, although the outputs are 150 PS (148 hp or 110 kW) and 180 PS (177 hp or 132 kW)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The non-PSE cars can also be had with three pure internal combustion engines, including a 1.2 litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol and a 1.5 litre four-cylinder turbodiesel that both serve up 130 PS (128 hp or 96 kW)

                Liverpool were tipped to make a shock transfer swoop for Arsenal star Bukayo Saka, whose current contract with the Gunners is due to expire in the summer of 2024 Bukayo Saka has ended Liverpool's hopes of signing him by agreeing a new contract with Arsenal

                About Us Advertise MANCHESTER, Feb 24 — Erik ten Hag’s transformation of Manchester United now has a European scalp to get excited about as Barcelona were vanquished on a night the Red Devils rolled back the years at Old Trafford

            <p>
                A six-year wait for silverware could come to an end when United face Newcastle in the League Cup final on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without a league title in a decade, United are just five points adrift of Premier League leaders Arsenal and also into the FA Cup last 16, where they face West Ham at home
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The wait for such a European night under the lights at Old Trafford goes even further back to when Barcelona were beaten in the semi-finals of the 2008 Champions League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “To see the passion that these guys have for Manchester United is just fantastic, especially the reaction to the crowd.” Ten Hag is hoping this is just the start on United’s road back to competing at the highest level in Europe

            <p>
                Amirudin had asked the government to state its stance on EPF withdrawals as a way to help ease the people’s financial burden
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also noted that any more withdrawals would only worsen the already alarming lack of savings among EPF members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that any additional withdrawals could also affect EPF’s ability to capitalise on new investment opportunities to ensure sustainable dividend payments to contributors in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that regardless of whether targeted or not, any type of early EPF withdrawal is not the right solution to address the financial burdens faced by contributors

            <p>
                “As a huge social security institution, EPF must cooperate with government agencies in building and strengthening a holistic and sustainable social security system for the well-being of Malaysians,” he said.

            <p>
                Anwar also noted that any more withdrawals would only worsen the already alarming lack of savings among EPF members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that any additional withdrawals could also affect EPF’s ability to capitalise on new investment opportunities to ensure sustainable dividend payments to contributors in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that regardless of whether targeted or not, any type of early EPF withdrawal is not the right solution to address the financial burdens faced by contributors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As a huge social security institution, EPF must cooperate with government agencies in building and strengthening a holistic and sustainable social security system for the well-being of Malaysians,” he said.

                THERE are currently no plans to review the tax structure for the automotive industry, especially the excise duty, says International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was responding to a question from MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong, who asked if the government has any plans to review tax structures in the automotive sector in order to lower car prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Does the government have any plans to review the existing tax structure, which has some impact on vehicle prices, and be able to reduce vehicle prices?” asked Dr Wee, the Ayer Hitam MP, in a supplementary question during Question Time

            <p>
                Tengku Zafrul said the government has no plans to review the tax structure for the automotive sector, especially the excise duty, which is important to spur the development of the industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This (excise duty) is to encourage local vendors to participate in the development of the automotive industry in the country,” said Tengku Zafrul, adding that the government had offered various incentives in the form of exemptions or reductions in excise duty and sales tax, in addition to the waiver of import duty for imported components used in the local assembly of vehicles

                A strategic cruise missile is launched during a drill in this undated photo released on Feb 24, 2023 by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The exercise on Thursday involved an apparently operational strategic cruise missile unit of the Korean People's Army, which fired the four "Hwasal-2" missiles in the area of Kim Chaek City, North Hamgyong Province, towards the sea off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula, state news agency KCNA said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The drill demonstrated "the war posture of the DPRK nuclear combat force bolstering up in every way its deadly nuclear counterattack capability against the hostile forces", said KCNA
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The missiles were not announced by South Korea or Japan, which often detect and publicly report North Korean launches

                US and South Korean officials took part in a tabletop, or simulated, exercise that focused on the possibility of North Korea using a nuclear weapon, the Pentagon said on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                North Korea could test-fire ICBMs on a lower, longer trajectory and conduct its seventh nuclear test this year to perfect its weapons capabilities, South Korean lawmakers said on Wednesday, citing intelligence officials.

                “We don’t expect major tax changes and, of course, no goods and services tax, but there may be some minor tax changes ahead of a full review of the tax system,” he said

                He is, however, hoping that the tax cuts introduced in the previous budget would be retained

                Under the tax cuts, those with chargeable tax income of between RM50,001 and RM70,000 will see their tax rate reduced from 13% to 11%, and those in the RM70,001 to RM100,000 bracket will have their tax rate reduced from 21% to 19%

                Anwar will table the revised budget in Parliament at 4pm today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We don’t expect major tax changes and, of course, no goods and services tax, but there may be some minor tax changes ahead of a full review of the tax system,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think Budget 2023 will still be expansionary, with the overall allocation being comparable to what was announced in October 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is, however, hoping that the tax cuts introduced in the previous budget would be retained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the tax cuts, those with chargeable tax income of between RM50,001 and RM70,000 will see their tax rate reduced from 13% to 11%, and those in the RM70,001 to RM100,000 bracket will have their tax rate reduced from 21% to 19%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I also hope to see a rationalisation strategy on government expenditure, which was badly lacking in the previously tabled budget,” he added

                It has been designed to take advantage of changes in how we tip and how employers monitor and report those tips to the IRS — with the aim of improving compliance and reducing unreported tip income

                The Tip Rate Determination Agreement (TRDA) allows the IRS and employers to agree on selected tip rates for different categories of employees, while the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (TRAC), has employers prepare a monthly report on tip income based on disclosures from employees who receive cash tips

                Manchester United had gone into their game with Barcelona knowing the tie was in the balance after a 2-2 draw last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Barcelona then punished United through Lewandowski, with the Poland international converting from the penalty spot

            <p>
                While the United star is prone to inconsistency, having struggled during the first 45 minutes, the Brazil international put in an enterprising display to help his side to victory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With United behind, the Brazil international made an astonishing block to prevent Barcelona from doubling their lead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United benefitted from Lisandro Martinez being available, with the Argentina international throwing himself at everything
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both United and Barcelona have struggled in recent years

                As your monthly car costs increase, you can dodge a debt default by avoiding two common auto loan mistakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the fact that car prices started to cool off by the end of 2022, a concerning trend of auto loan defaults and car repossessions has started to surface

                For example, if you have $15,000 left to pay on your auto loan and your car is now worth $10,000, that means you have negative equity of $5,000 that you still have to pay

                If you can’t pay off your old auto loan out of pocket, you’ll have to roll the negative equity over to your new loan

            <p>
                The older your car, the more likely you’ll have to spend money on repairs and maintenance in addition to your monthly loan payments

                As it turns out, she parked her son’s Tesla Model 3 at a ChargePoint charging station at the mall but could not get it to charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Brownlee explained to her that to charge a Tesla at a ChargePoint charging station, she would need an adapter

            <p>
                She also didn’t have a ChargePoint account, so Brownlee explained to her how to pay to start the session without requiring an account

                As such, a total of 10 shuttle bus services between the Sentul Timur and Bandaraya stations were activated during the peak period this evening to accommodate and handle affected passengers

                It added that the shuttle buses will stop at the Sentul Timur, Sentul, Titiwangsa, PWTC, Sultan Ismail and Bandaraya stations, with the one-way journey from Sentul Timur to Bandaraya expected to take 30 minutes

                Due to the structural and track damage near the Bandaraya station, these trains cannot return to the LRT depot in Ampang for maintenance work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, a total of 10 shuttle bus services between the Sentul Timur and Bandaraya stations were activated during the peak period this evening to accommodate and handle affected passengers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that the shuttle buses will stop at the Sentul Timur, Sentul, Titiwangsa, PWTC, Sultan Ismail and Bandaraya stations, with the one-way journey from Sentul Timur to Bandaraya expected to take 30 minutes

                Siti Bainun, 31, said she had also seen the injuries while Bella lived in the condominium, but denied that she had neglected Bella when the teenager was in her care

                Siti Bainun who was accused of neglecting and abusing the 13-year-old girl, said this during cross-examination by deputy public prosecutor Zahida Zakaria at her defence trial on Thursday (Feb 23)

            <p>
                However, the accused could not confirm if all of Bella's injuries in the video recorded by the first prosecution witness, Zurianty Sudin in her condominium (Siti Bainun) on June 24, 2021 were the same as Bella's injuries when she arrived at Kuala Lumpur Hospital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Questioned by another deputy public prosecutor Zilfinaz Abbas, Siti Bainun said she never left her children including Bella without adult supervision if she went out because a former resident of the house Yasmin Nahar Mahmood (the fifth prosecution witness) would be in the condominium
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Siti Bainun agreed with Zilfinaz's suggestion that children with Down syndrome need more attention than normal children

                Lawyer Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee, who represented Shafee, confirmed the date of the decision when contacted Thursday (Feb 23)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee was also represented by Datuk Seri Rajan Navaratnam while LHDN senior counsel Norzilah Abdul Hamid and Muhammad Faqrol Syazreen Mohd Ghause also acted for the LHDN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyer filed the application in May 2021, among others, on the grounds that the tax claim was an attack on him as a political victim in his capacity as a lawyer for Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and was considered to be an Umno lawyer even though he was not the party's lawyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 27, 2021, LHDN requested that the suit against Shafee be decided through direct judgment on the grounds that the defendant failed to pay the entire income tax arrears and the tax increase imposed on him amounting to RM9,414,708.32 within the stipulated period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LHDN, which filed the suit on May 6, 2021, claimed that until now, the lawyer had still failed to pay the amount of income tax owed for the Assessment Years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016 including the increase on the imposed sum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee is Najib's lawyer in the case of misappropriation of SRC International Sdn Bhd and 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — The Malaysian government through the Inland Revenue Board (IRB) today objected to Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah’s application to obtain leave from the court to file a counterclaim against IRB’s demand that he pays income tax arrears amounting to RM9.41 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee’s lawyer who represented Muhammad Shafee when contacted confirmed the date of the decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee was also represented by Datuk Seri Rajan Navaratnam while IRB senior counsel Norzilah Abdul Hamid and Muhammad Faqrol Syazreen Mohd Ghause also acted for the IRB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyer filed the application in May 2021, among others on the grounds that the tax claim was an attack on him as a political victim in his capacity as a lawyer for Datuk Seri Najib Razak and was considered to be an Umno lawyer even though he was not the party’s lawyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On September 27, 2021, IRB requested that the suit against Muhammad Shafee be decided through direct judgment on the grounds that the defendant failed to pay the entire income tax arrears and the tax increase imposed on him amounting to RM9,414,708.32 within the stipulated period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee is Najib’s lawyer in the case of misappropriation of SRC International Sdn Bhd and 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — The Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) has appealed to the Finance Ministry and the Public Service Department (JPA) to provide the Health Ministry (MoH) the support it needs concerning the public healthcare system

            <p>
                As for issues raised during the session, Dr Muruga said they were divided broadly into two categories namely human resources and infrastructure

            <p>
                “Under infrastructure, MMA highlighted the need for proper development and maintenance of both physical and digital infrastructure including standardisation and proper maintenance to prevent a collapse of electronic records systems,” he said, adding that MMA would be following up with the ministry on their progress

                Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, added that the number of active members who had reached the basic savings target of RM240,000 by the age of 55 had gone down from 36% in 2020 to 29% at the end of last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amirudin had asked the government to state its stance on EPF withdrawals as a way to help ease the people’s financial burden
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also noted any more withdrawals would only worsen the already alarming lack of savings among EPF members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that any additional withdrawal could also affect EPF's new investment opportunities and profit-generation for the purpose of dividend payment to contributors in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that regardless of whether targeted or not, any type of EPF withdrawal was not the right long-term solution to resolve the financial burden faced by contributors, especially those who are struggling

                Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, added that the number of active members who had reached the basic savings target of RM240,000 by the age of 55 had gone down from 36% in 2020 to 29% at the end of last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amirudin had asked the government to state its stance on EPF withdrawals as a way to help ease the people’s financial burden
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also noted any more withdrawals would only worsen the already alarming lack of savings among EPF members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that any additional withdrawal could also affect EPF's new investment opportunities and profit-generation for the purpose of dividend payment to contributors in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that regardless of whether targeted or not, any type of EPF withdrawal was not the right long-term solution to resolve the financial burden faced by contributors, especially those who are struggling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As a huge social security institution, EPF must cooperate with government agencies in building and strengthening a holistic and sustainable social security system for the wellbeing of Malaysians," said the Prime Minister

                "Does the government have any plans to review the existing tax structure, which has some impact on vehicle prices, and at the same time is able to reduce vehicle prices," he said in a supplementary question during Question Time in the Dewan Rakyat today (Feb 23)

                The collapse on Wednesday at an open-pit mine in the Alxa League operated by Xinjing Coal Mining left a pile of debris roughly 500m across and an estimated 80m high, state media reported

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — Former Klang MP Charles Santiago today questioned how chicken and eggs can remain affordable for the B60 or those in the bottom 60 per cent income tier in Malaysia if the government removes the maximum selling price after June, given that just a few companies dominate production of these food items
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He called for transparency in the government’s removal of price controls or plan to float the prices of chicken and eggs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Given that eight firms control 65 per cent of production, how will the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS) ensure chicken and egg prices remain affordable to the B60 while also meeting self-sufficiency needs? “As this dominance is alarming, the Malaysia Competition Commission should release its findings on cartel activities in the industry before the float is introduced, especially since the findings have been pending for too long now,” he said in a statement, without naming those eight companies

            <p>
                Currently, the government has imposed price controls to only allow the maximum retail selling price in peninsular Malaysia for chicken to be at RM9.40 per kg, and the highest allowed selling price for eggs to be at 45 sen (Grade A), 43 sen (Grade B) and 41 sen (Grade C)

                KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 – At a town hall with government doctors yesterday, Dr Zaliha Mustafa gave little solid commitment to solutions for multiple chronic problems plaguing a public health service in crisis – amid the spectre of health worker strikes

                A seismic shake-up of the governance of English football, including the creation on an independent regulator for the elite game, will move closer with the publication of a wide-ranging government white paper on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It would also have the power to prevent English clubs from joining breakaway competitions such as the European Super League, which six Premier League clubs signalled their intent to join in 2021 before abandoning plans after a fans' backlash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "These bold new plans will put fans back at the heart of football and protect the rich heritage and traditions of our much-loved clubs." The Premier League, which has argued against the need for an independent regulator, said the white paper was a "significant moment" for English football, while the Football Association welcomed the commitment to improve the "financial sustainability and governance of professional clubs." Among the powers of the independent regulator would be to implement a licensing system from the Premier League down to the National League (fifth tier) and requiring clubs to demonstrate sound financial business models before being allowed to compete
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the Premier League, launched in 1992, has been an unprecedented financial success, lower down the English pyramid the situation has been grim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Premier League said it recognised the case for change in football governance and would carefully consider the government's plan for England to become the "first major nation to make football a government-regulated industry." It insists it has taken action to address issues raised in the Fan-Led Review and that £1.6bn is being reinvested down the pyramid over the next three seasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We will now work constructively with stakeholders to ensure that the proposed government regulator does not lead to any unintended consequences that could affect the Premier League's position as the most-watched football league in the world, reduce its competitiveness or put the unrivalled levels of funding we provide at risk," the Premier League said

Among the powers of the independent regulator would be to implement a licensing system from the Premier League down to the National League (fifth tier) and requiring clubs to demonstrate sound financial business models before being allowed to compete
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the Premier League, launched in 1992, has been an unprecedented financial success, lower down the English pyramid the situation has been grim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Premier League said it recognised the case for change in football governance and would carefully consider the government's plan for England to become the "first major nation to make football a government-regulated industry." It insists it has taken action to address issues raised in the Fan-Led Review and that £1.6bn is being reinvested down the pyramid over the next three seasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We will now work constructively with stakeholders to ensure that the proposed government regulator does not lead to any unintended consequences that could affect the Premier League's position as the most-watched football league in the world, reduce its competitiveness or put the unrivalled levels of funding we provide at risk," the Premier League said

                With Liverpool owner John W Henry having seemingly committed to the club, it is clear that FSG will need to back Liverpool in a number of ways to bring success back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here are the two Liverpool.com stories from today that you shouldn't miss

            <p>
                Of course, with Liverpool owner John W Henry having divulged that FSG does not plan to sell Liverpool in the immediate future, the focus will now shift to how best the club can ensure it stays competitive in the coming years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With this in mind, Liverpool will need to give themselves some stability in this regard

                As your monthly car costs increase, you can dodge a debt default by avoiding two common auto loan mistakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the fact that car prices started to cool off by the end of 2022, a concerning trend of auto loan defaults and car repossessions has started to surface

            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if you have $15,000 left to pay on your auto loan and your car is now worth $10,000, that means you have negative equity of $5,000 that you still have to pay

            <p>
                If you can’t pay off your old auto loan out of pocket, you’ll have to roll the negative equity over to your new loan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The older your car, the more likely you’ll have to spend money on repairs and maintenance in addition to your monthly loan payments

                Besides the South China Sea, the foreign ministers also talked about the Myanmar crisis.  Mdm Marsudi expressed her appreciation for China supporting the Five-Point of Consensus to end the violence in Myanmar following the February 2021 coup.  “The Five-Point of Consensus is the main reference for ASEAN to help Myanmar out of its political crisis,” she said referring to the consensus adopted by ASEAN leaders in Jakarta in April 2021

                Syed Saddiq, who took the stand today in day one of his criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of funds trial, said he also spoke to an MACC officer identified as Ihsan who admitted the agency was being used as a tool by the ruling government to prosecute their opponents

                This is good news for consumers but a lot will depend on the final retail pricing once all the operators negotiate with TM on wholesale access pricing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last week, the telco industry regulator released the new wholesale access pricing as per the mandatory standard for access pricing (MSAP) structure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the higher-speed plans, a retail price cut is possible, with the resulting revenue loss likely offset by elasticity impact to some extent and, possibly, masked by ongoing overall subscriber growth in its view
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kenanga Research said that the new MSAP will have little impact on TM’s broadband packages

                The forecast for consumers is the overall access prices are only materially lower for higher-speed plans and research houses do not expect lower retail prices for the more popular lower-speed plans

                For consumers, the forecast is that the overall access prices are only materially lower for the higher-speed plans and research houses do not expect lower retail prices for the more popular lower-speed plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is good news for consumers but a lot will depend on the final retail pricing once all the operators negotiate with TM on wholesale access pricing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last week, the telco industry regulator released the new wholesale access pricing as per the mandatory standard for access pricing (MSAP) structure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the higher-speed plans, a retail price cut is possible, with the resulting revenue loss likely offset by elasticity impact to some extent and, possibly, masked by ongoing overall subscriber growth in its view
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kenanga Research said that the new MSAP will have little impact on TM’s broadband packages

                The MCA president used a short poem to ask Works Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi about the status of the much-needed project during a Parliament session on Wednesday (Feb 23)

                Nanta then replied that the proposal had been reviewed by the ministry which is also in agreement that the expansion is needed for the four-lane highway

                Currently, the cheapest Tesla on sale in Australia in the Model 3 RWD, which starts at AUD$64,300 (RM195,066) before on-road costs in the country

            <p>
                Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously announced in October 2022 that the EV maker is working on a next-generation platform that would be half the price of the Model 3 and Model Y, and a model that is set to be priced in the region of US$25,000 (RM111,025) is expected to make its debut in 2023, this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The idea of a more affordable Tesla model was put forth by Musk as early as 2018, at which time the CEO said the company could produce in three years from that time, or 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When June 2021 rolled around, Musk said that the new model, which will be a hatchback, is planned for a 2023 debut
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One way that Tesla could manage costs with the new model is with its tabless 4680 battery cell design, which the company revealed at its Battery Day event in September 2020

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan said today he has offered to relinquish his information chief position in the party due to his ongoing court case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But let this decision be made by the top leadership,” Wan Saiful told a press conference here at the Parliament building here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that his position as the information chief is an executive position, it was rightful that he relinquished it until he is able to prove his innocence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Wan Saiful claimed trial for two bribery charges at the Sessions Court here, in connection with the government’s Jana Wibawa scheme back in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second charge, Wan Saiful was accused of receiving RM6,962,694.54 from Nepturis in relation to the same government road project
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — The suspension of rail services since January was due to structural damage of the viaduct and cracked pier near the Bandaraya LRT station, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said today

                One patent was revoked by the High Court in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Friday, in a landmark decision which addressed novel points of patent law, the Court of Appeal ordered the second patent to be revoked as it was not sufficiently clear and complete

            <p>
                One patent, identified as SG 508, relates to a method of changing the colour of a lab-grown diamond by heat treatment

                Under the Patents Act, a patent is valid only if it discloses the invention “in a manner which is clear and complete”

            <p>
                The court found that the patent was not sufficiently clear, as it did not set out the method to allow a skilled person reading the patent to grow the lab-grown diamond
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court found that the patent was also insufficient because it was “uncertain” – even if a skilled person grew a diamond, he would not know whether that diamond infringed Element Six’s patent.

                Most analysts do not think the vehicle sector can replicate the record-breaking sales in 2022, when the total industry volume hit 720,000 units

                He said Dr Halimah’s statement, made during the debate on the Royal Address in Parliament last week, was not based on facts and scientific data, and that what she said could cause misunderstanding and exacerbate the stigma against those with autism and also the disabled community in Malaysia

                “I strongly believe that she not only needs to retract and clarify that statement, but make a clear and sincere apology to the different communities that are affected and also the public for continuing to lie about it,” he said in a statement yesterday

            <p>
                “She continues to deny it in several public statements, including a statement where she tried to mislead the House again by denying that such statement was ever uttered, and asking the House to refer to the Hansard to prove that such a statement was never spoken

            <p>
                Dr Halimah caused a stir in Parliament and also provoked reaction from the public, particularly autism groups, when she said that the Menu Rahmah meals could cause various illnesses such as cancer, autoimmune diseases or autism, due to the use of low-quality ingredients

                Dr Yii says Dr Halimah’s statement about Menu Rahmah is not based on facts and scientific data, adding that such as such claim can cause misunderstanding and exacerbate the stigma against those with autism and also the disabled community in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Dr Halimah’s statement, made during the debate on the Royal Address in Parliament last week, was not based on facts and scientific data, and that what she said could cause misunderstanding and exacerbate the stigma against those with autism and also the disabled community in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I strongly believe that she not only needs to retract and clarify that statement, but make a clear and sincere apology to the different communities that are affected and also the public for continuing to lie about it,” he said in a statement yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “She continues to deny it in several public statements, including a statement where she tried to mislead the House again by denying that such statement was ever uttered, and asking the House to refer to the Hansard to prove that such a statement was never spoken
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Evidence of such was also furnished to the Speaker for further action,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Halimah caused a stir in Parliament and also provoked reaction from the public, particularly autism groups, when she said that the Menu Rahmah meals could cause various illnesses such as cancer, autoimmune diseases or autism, due to the use of low-quality ingredients

                ERIK TEN HAG has had a meeting with Sir Alex Ferguson ahead of Manchester United’s huge clash with Barcelona on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sir Alex is a huge admirer of Ten Hag and what he has done for the club since taking charge in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Sir Alex, who won United the treble in 1999, was clearly happy to share his wisdom on football and the club itself over dinner on Tuesday evening
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has United in the title race, the fifth round of the FA Cup, and they take on Newcastle in the final of the Carabao Cup on Sunday in search of their first trophy since 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ferguson of course claimed Manchester United’s last win over Barcelona by 1-0 in the Champions League semi-final second-leg in 2008 having fought out a goalless draw in the Nou Camp

                ERIK TEN HAG has had a meeting with Sir Alex Ferguson ahead of Manchester United’s huge clash with Barcelona on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sir Alex is a huge admirer of Ten Hag and what he has done for the club since taking charge in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Sir Alex, who won United the treble in 1999, was clearly happy to share his wisdom on football and the club itself over dinner on Tuesday evening
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has United in the title race, the fifth round of the FA Cup, and they take on Newcastle in the final of the Carabao Cup on Sunday in search of their first trophy since 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ferguson of course claimed Manchester United’s last win over Barcelona by 1-0 in the Champions League semi-final second-leg in 2008 having fought out a goalless draw in the Nou Camp

                A year after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, some cynics lament that the unprecedented economic pressure campaign against Russia has not yet ended the Putin regime

            <p>
                This past year, the Russian economic machine has been impaired as our original research compendium shows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Russian economy has long been dominated by oil and gas, which accounts for over 50% of the government’s revenue, over 50% of export earnings, and nearly 20% of GDP every year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Government expenditures rose 30% year-over-year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only then will the Russian economy and people stand a chance of returning to prosperity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                has thwarted Putin’s energy blackmail

            <p>
                A year after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, some cynics lament that the unprecedented economic pressure campaign against Russia has not yet ended the Putin regime
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This past year, the Russian economic machine has been impaired as our original research compendium shows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Russian economy has long been dominated by oil and gas, which accounts for over 50% of the government’s revenue, over 50% of export earnings, and nearly 20% of GDP every year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Government expenditures rose 30% year-over-year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only then will the Russian economy and people stand a chance of returning to prosperity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                has thwarted Putin’s energy blackmail

                Tierney, 25, has managed just four Premier League starts all season following the signing of Oleksandr Zinchenko last summer

                But the way the team is playing this season, with Zinchenko stepping into midfield for much of the match, does not suit Tierney’s style

            <p>
                And even when Zinchenko was sidelined by injury throughout the whole of October, Arteta preferred to play Takehiro Tomiyasu at left-back ahead of Tierney

            <p>
                Arteta, though, is unlikely to stand in the way of his departure as he has both Tomiyasu and recent signing Jakub Kiwior who can act as back-up to Zinchenko

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 — The prices of chicken and eggs are expected to be floated after June as part of the government’s efforts to overcome food shortage, says Agriculture and Food Security Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January, Mohamad reportedly said that MAFS was studying the need to float the price of eggs in the market and provide targeted subsidies to the B40 group, and that discussions were being held with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy and KPDN over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current retail ceiling price in Peninsular Malaysia for standard chicken is RM9.40 per kg and for eggs, it is 45 sen for Grade A, Grade B (43 sen) and Grade C (41 sen) respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, commenting on grain corn, which is almost 100 per cent imported from Argentina and Brazil — affecting the price of chicken and eggs — Mohamad said the government was encouraging its cultivation in Malaysia this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Budget 2023 which will be tabled this Friday, Mohamad said he hoped there would be no reduction in the amount allocated to his ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to the 15th General Election at the end of last year, the government led by Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob had announced Budget 2023 with a total allocation of RM372.3 billion, and of the amount, RM5.32 billion was allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries

                Defensively, Matip was a close shout for me to start, but I think Gomez has the extra pace needed to handle a Real Madrid side who will be dangerous on the counter

            <p>
                TasteAtlas, which focuses on food and features reviews as well as recommendations from culinary professionals and critics around the world, tweeted on Saturday (Feb 18) a ranking of the top 50 street foods in the world.  Guotie, which took the top place, is a pan-fried dumpling originating from Northern China that is commonly filled with minced pork, Chinese cabbage, scallions, ginger, rice wine, and sesame seed oil, according to TasteAtlas.  Coming in second is Malaysia’s savoury roti canai which is a flatbread with a soft interior that is pan-fried, commonly with ghee, to produce a crispy outer layer.  The dough, which is made with flour, water, eggs and fat, is repeatedly folded to give the flatbread a layered texture.  Also in the top 10 are Japan’s karaage which took the sixth spot, and Vietnam’s bánh mì which was in the seventh position.  Kaarage, or Japanese fried chicken, is pre-marinated chicken that is lightly coated in arrowroot starch before being deep-fried, creating a meat that is succulent on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The karaage dishes are usually seasoned with garlic and ginger and served with soy sauce on the side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other favourites that joined the top 50 list include China’s Shengjian mantou (pan-fried buns) (12th), Indonesia’s bubur ayam (chicken porridge) (13th), and South Korea’s hotteok (sweet pancake) (38th).

                Former AOA member Mina said she lost 15 million Korean won after she started working on Feb 6
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Worried that she would lose her coins if she did not comply, Mina claimed she sent a total of 15 million Korean won over six wire transfers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the company discovered she was a former K-pop idol, it also requested photos of her and her former bandmates, who were popular in 2014 and 2015
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mina, who made her debut in eight-member group AOA in 2012, alleged in 2020 that her bandmate Jimin had bullied her for a decade, which led to Mina leaving the group in 2019 and Jimin exiting in 2020

                Former AOA member Mina said she lost 15 million Korean won after she started working on Feb 6
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Worried that she would lose her coins if she did not comply, Mina claimed she sent a total of 15 million Korean won over six wire transfers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the company discovered she was a former K-pop idol, it also requested photos of her and her former bandmates, who were popular in 2014 and 2015
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mina, who made her debut in eight-member group AOA in 2012, alleged in 2020 that her bandmate Jimin had bullied her for a decade, which led to Mina leaving the group in 2019 and Jimin exiting in 2020

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 — Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH) should come up with a few travel options for Malaysian Muslim pilgrims based on how long they plan to stay in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Bera MP Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing data from the Muslim pilgrim’s fund, Ismail Sabri said the cost of the Haj has increased from RM25,540 last year to RM31,870 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the more the costs increase, the bigger the financial burden on LTH in subsidising the travel expenses for Muslim pilgrims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the four-day package will cover the necessary Haj obligations for Muslim pilgrims while those who opt for the longer packages would be able to visit Medina, another city in Saudi Arabia holy to Muslims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri also proposed a review of the Tabung Haji Act 1995, saying many provisions are now outdated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LTH executive director Datuk Seri Syed Saleh Syed Abdul Rahman said last month that the cost of completing a Haj pilgrimage has gone up to about RM31,000 this year, increasing by about RM2,368 from last season.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 — Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH) should come up with a few travel options for Malaysian Muslim pilgrims based on how long they plan to stay in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Bera MP Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing data from the Muslim pilgrim’s fund, Ismail Sabri said the cost of the Haj has increased from RM25,540 last year to RM31,870 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the more the costs increase, the bigger the financial burden on LTH in subsidising the travel expenses for Muslim pilgrims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the four-day package will cover the necessary Haj obligations for Muslim pilgrims while those who opt for the longer packages would be able to visit Medina, another city in Saudi Arabia holy to Muslims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri also proposed a review of the Tabung Haji Act 1995, saying many provisions are now outdated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LTH executive director Datuk Seri Syed Saleh Syed Abdul Rahman said last month that the cost of completing a Haj pilgrimage has gone up to about RM31,000 this year, increasing by about RM2,368 from last season.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has today said he had instructed that nobody be spared from investigations by enforcement authorities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If I see there are cases of blatant corruption and discrepancies, and there is proof, I will not say sorry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “My orders, to all investigation bodies this morning, take action on all, I don’t care, including PKR as I am not able to guarantee that my party is 100 per cent clean, as claimed by the other side that we are clean, but it’s proven untrue,” Anwar told the Parliament during Prime Minister’s Question Time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was responding to a question asked by PAS’ Pasir Mas MP Ahmad Fadhli Shaari who asked if the prime minister would be taking any action on Cabinet ministers who are involved in court cases, among them Umno’s Bagan Datuk MP Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>

                “My orders, to all investigation bodies this morning, take action on all, I don’t care, including PKR as I am not able to guarantee that my party is 100 per cent clean, as claimed by the other side that we are clean, but it’s proven untrue,” Anwar told the Parliament during Prime Minister’s Question Time

            <p>
                He was responding to a question asked by PAS’ Pasir Mas MP Ahmad Fadhli Shaari who asked if the prime minister would be taking any action on Cabinet ministers who are involved in court cases, among them Umno’s Bagan Datuk MP Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 — Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan today claimed trial to two bribery charges at the Sessions Court here, in connection with the government’s Jana Wibawa scheme back in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second charge, Wan Saiful — who is also Bersatu information chief — was accused of receiving RM6,962,694.54 from Nepturis in relation to the same government road project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sessions Court judge Azura Alwi set bail at RM400,000 and told Wan Saiful that he has to surrender his passport to the court before March 22
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a separate courtroom, Segambut Bersatu division deputy chief Adam Radlan Adam Muhammad also claimed trial to two charges under Section 16(a) of the MACC Act before Sessions Court Judge Suzana Hussin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the first charge, the 42-year-old who is also a businessman was accused of soliciting between 3.5 per cent and 7 per cent of a project value from one Mat Jusoh Mamat, said to be the director or MIE Infrastructure & Energy Sdn Bhd, for the government’s Jana Wibawa programme

                Smoke billows from the cooling towers of a coal-fired power plant in Ahmedabad, India, on Oct 13, 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many of India's power plants that use imported coal, including those owned by Adani Power and Tata Power in the western state of Gujarat, have not operated at full capacity recently because they have found it difficult to compete with power generated from cheap domestic coal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters reported last month on India's plans to use the law to maximise coal power output
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the notice sent to all imported coal-based power plants, the ministry said it expects them to operate at full capacity and sell power to buyers on exchanges

            <p>
                India's imported coal plants have a total capacity of 17 gigawatts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                India expects its power plants to burn about 8 per cent more coal in the financial year ending March 2024, with increased economic activity and erratic weather to continue to boost growth in demand for power

                QSI, a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority, the Gulf state’s sovereign wealth fund, gained control of the French club in 2011 for just €70 million (RM331m at the current exchange rate)

                Malaysia should also adopt neutrality in trade policies to attract investment for long-term economic stability, said Dr Jomo Kwame Sundram

            <p>
                The subject of targeted subsidy has been in the spotlight, particularly targeted petrol subsidy, as the current blanket subsidy mechanism caused total subsidy bills to jump to RM80 billion last year amid elevated oil prices

                This put a strain on the government’s coffers, which has seen a gradual increase in big-ticket operating expenditures, such as subsidies, debt service charges and emoluments as a percentage of federal government revenue year after year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jomo expects more responsible budgets and major reforms by the government over the medium term rather than sooner — perhaps in Budget 2024 to be tabled in October this year, once the regime is further consolidated following imminent state elections in mid-2023

                Premier League • England The agent of Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic reportedly blocked a big-money January switch to Manchester United, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Along with United, Chelsea have also registered an interest in signing Vlahovic, but it seems the Red Devils came very close to sealing a stunning winter switch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Spanish outlet AS, Juventus accepted an offer between €100m (£88.8m) and €120m (£106.5m) for Vlahovic from an unnamed Premier League club, believed to be Man Utd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, United are thought to be keen to bring in another quality striker for next season – someone who could link up effectively with Marcus Rashford, who is in the form of his career at the moment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But, it seems United we’re instead looking to bring in Vlahovic in January, who would have been a fantastic addition, and could’ve given them the firepower necessary to push for the Premier League title
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his agent rejecting a winter switch, United continue to be linked with Vlahovic, so there is a good chance that they will go back in for him this summer Recent reports suggest that Real Madrid are also interested in signing the Serbian, so United may have to battle them, and Chelsea, for his signature

                The Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corp (MGTC) has honoured Penang for its design as part of its drive to promote Low Carbon Cities (LCCs) in Malaysia, with the state given the “Diamond” award for PSI’s design at the Low Carbon City 2022 event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                MGTC, an agency under the Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change Ministry, said the Low Carbon City 2022 award was part of its flagship programme called the Low Carbon Cities 2030 Challenge (LCC2030C), an initiative to help shift Malaysian cities and conversations towards a low carbon future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The push for low carbon cities began in 2011, when the Low Carbon Cities Framework and Assessment System (LCCF) was set up by the government (under the then Energy, Green Technology and Water Ministry) to guide local authorities and statutory organisations to transform their towns and territories into low carbon urban centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PSI scored big in both energy consumption and low-emission mobility, with each contributing savings of 15.61% and 20.26%, respectively

                What happened last May doesn’t matter on Tuesday night.  Liverpool and Real Madrid are now new teams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real will try to play to Vinicius as much as they can in the gap that Alexander-Arnold will leave when he goes forward.  How can you stop Real doing that? It will be a big challenge for Jurgen Klopp because Alexander-Arnold offers so much when he pushes high, but Vinicius is the one player who can make a difference and hurt Liverpool

                We were so good and went on to win 4-0.  I watched Liverpool against Everton last week and the intensity of the team and the fans made the difference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real’s advantage in the past was having more experience in important European games but Liverpool have a lot of players like that now.  If they play with the same intensity as they did in their last home game, Liverpool will have chances

                In a widely circulated article, a Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) academician and chip researcher say China’s chip sector has entered a “dark forest” without access to advanced US chip-making software and coming restrictions on deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography tools made by Japan and the Netherlands
            </p>

                “As Chinese chip makers could buy and use the PDK in the past, our decision-makers, government officials and industry players tended to think that China could develop its chip sector without fundamental research.” “But since the US turned off the ‘lighthouse,’ we have now entered a dark forest,” they wrote, referring to US blocks on selling advanced chip-making equipment to China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The writers say China’s research and development investments in the sector represent less than 5% of US investments while China still lacks a proper institution to organize the industry’s developments

                The Human Resources Minister said the reduction in the cost of recruitment would be discussed at the two-day Joint Working Group Meeting in Yogjakarta beginning Wednesday (Feb 22)

            <p>
                Sivakumar said he hoped the cost could be brought down to under RM9,000 compared to the RM12,000 decided in the last meeting in November 2022, inclusive of the quarantine cost of RM3,000

            <p>
                "To have zero cost is impossible because there are costs involved including in Malaysia, but we look at what is the best mechanism to reduce the cost,” he told the Malaysian media after holding a meeting with his Indonesian counterpart, Dr Ida Fauziyah on Monday (Feb 20)

            <p>
                Weghorst has arrived at United at a difficult time given he will naturally draw comparisons with Anthony Martial and Cristiano Ronaldo, and while he has not matched the duo for goals this season, he has at least given Ten Hag the reliable work rate he demands up front

            <p>
                On Oct 27, last year, the High Court in Kuala Lumpur dismissed the former prime minister's application to obtain leave to commence a judicial review to challenge the Prisons Department's refusal to allow his request to attend Parliament sittings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Datuk Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid held that Najib's application was academic as he ceased to be a MP following the dissolution of Parliament on Oct 10 last year, which had paved the way for the 15th General Election which was subsequently held on Nov 19 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib had named the Malaysian Government, the Minister of Home Affairs and the Commissioner-General of Prisons in his application seeking leave to initiate a judicial review which he filed on Oct 5, last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hearing of his application to review the Federal Court's decision is currently ongoing

                Following his incarceration, Najib had since sought to challenge the Federal Court’s five-member bench’s August 2022 unanimous decision in affirming his conviction, sentence and fine meted out by the High Court for the misappropriation of RM42 million of SRC International Sdn Bhd fund

                Telling the Federal Court during the former prime minister’s bid to have his SRC International conviction and sentence reviewed, Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah said then counsel Hisyam Teh Poh Teik was not accorded reasonable opportunity to present his case in August 2022

            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee said despite the defence’s insistence in August back then, the Federal Court’s five-judge panel led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat unanimously dismissed the defence’s bid for a postponement to be granted

                Siti Bainun, 31, told the court that she had appointed Mohammad Farhan Maaruf to represent her in the defence trial
            </p>

                Mohammad Farhan, when confirming the matter, said he was re-appointed by Siti Bainun yesterday

            <p>
                Subsequently, deputy public prosecutor Zilfinaz Abbas requested the court to record the chronology of the withdrawal of the lawyers representing Siti Bainun in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the withdrawal of the five lawyers, Siti Bainun was left with no legal representation in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Jan 26, Judge Izralizam ordered Siti Bainun to enter her defence on the charges even though she had no legal representation, saying that the proceedings should continue so as not to disrupt the progress of the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Nov 24 last year, the court ordered Siti Bainun to enter her defence on the charges of neglecting and abusing Bella after the prosecution succeeded in establishing a prima facie case against her at the end of the prosecution case

                Siti Bainun, 31, told the court that she had appointed Mohammad Farhan Maaruf to represent her in the defence trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohammad Farhan, when confirming the matter, said he was re-appointed by Siti Bainun yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Subsequently, deputy public prosecutor Zilfinaz Abbas requested the court to record the chronology of the withdrawal of the lawyers representing Siti Bainun in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the withdrawal of the five lawyers, Siti Bainun was left with no legal representation in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Jan 26, Judge Izralizam ordered Siti Bainun to enter her defence on the charges even though she had no legal representation, saying that the proceedings should continue so as not to disrupt the progress of the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Nov 24 last year, the court ordered Siti Bainun to enter her defence on the charges of neglecting and abusing Bella after the prosecution succeeded in establishing a prima facie case against her at the end of the prosecution case

                Youth wing members of Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) clad in medieval Islamic war attire, marching with fake swords and shields in Setiu, Terengganu on Feb 17, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Terengganu police chief Rohaimi Md Isa, initial investigations showed that the event took place on Friday (Feb 17) at a resort in Setiu, Terengganu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Police will carry out an investigation to identify any offences in the programme and appropriate action will be taken,” he said in a statement on Monday.  Mr Rohaimi, however, said that the police were not informed about the march involving replicas of weapons, though they were notified of the event earlier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We were not informed about the march with replicas of weapons, which has caused uneasiness and concern among the public,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The march was part of a two-day PAS youth wing gathering, known as Himpunan Pemuda Islam Terengganu (HIMPIT), or Terengganu Muslim Youth Gathering.  Mr Rohaimi added that the march, which was attended by party members from various districts in the state, was part of a design competition involving the theme of clothing, weapons and Islamic heritage.  In a statement on Monday, Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail condemned the march and urged all parties to stop acts that have the potential to create chaos for the people and the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also questioned the intention of the march which was uploaded to social media with an Arabic song in the background emphasising the theme of war.  “This invites the question of whether this parade meant to inject the spirit of war,” said Mr Saifuddin

                He added that the Feb 12 incident has sparked a debate about the hospital's dress code

                He has been unhappy with the manner in which Manchester United has been run under the deeply unpopular Glazer family
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ratcliffe — born in Failsworth, Greater Manchester — was blunt in an interview with The Times in 2019 when outlining the reasons why he would not have bought United outright at that time, even if it was up for sale

            <p>
                “United have spent an immense amount since (Sir Alex) Ferguson left (he retired in 2013 after guiding them to their last league title) and been poor, to put it mildly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We want a Manchester United anchored in its proud history and roots in the north-west of England, putting the Manchester back into Manchester United,” Ineos said in their statement confirming they were in the race to buy the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is a far cry from the bitter cold of the North and South Poles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It was one of the more miserable experiences of my life,” Ratcliffe said of the 2011 trip to the South Pole

                He has been unhappy with the manner in which Manchester United has been run under the deeply unpopular Glazer family
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ratcliffe — born in Failsworth, Greater Manchester — was blunt in an interview with The Times in 2019 when outlining the reasons why he would not have bought United outright at that time, even if it was up for sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “United have spent an immense amount since (Sir Alex) Ferguson left (he retired in 2013 after guiding them to their last league title) and been poor, to put it mildly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We want a Manchester United anchored in its proud history and roots in the north-west of England, putting the Manchester back into Manchester United,” Ineos said in their statement confirming they were in the race to buy the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is a far cry from the bitter cold of the North and South Poles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It was one of the more miserable experiences of my life,” Ratcliffe said of the 2011 trip to the South Pole
            </p>

            <p>
                Search and rescue efforts have been completed in the earthquake zone except in Kahramanmaras and Hatay provinces, Yunus Sezer, the head of AFAD, told reporters

                Sezer said search and rescue efforts continued in nearly 40 buildings, while over 6,000 containers have been set up

            <p>

            <p>
                “We continue to house more than 1 million disaster victims in the region in tent cities, container cities and public guesthouses.” Sezer said that cash aid of 10,000 Turkish liras (US$531) has been given to nearly 800,000 citizens

                One of the reasons the Man Utd supporters like Ten Hag so much is that he has gotten the best out of forward Marcus Rashford

                Man Utd were put up for sale by the Glazer family in November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Ten Hag has done a great job since becoming Man Utd manager in the summer, a takeover of the club clearly brings with it a lot of uncertainty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He [Ten Hag] is only six months in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [I am] 100 per cent sure the Qataris will put their own people there.” Man Utd fans would be hugely concerned if Ten Hag was axed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Luckily for the Man Utd faithful, it does not seem like Ten Hag is going anywhere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the reasons the Man Utd supporters like Ten Hag so much is that he has gotten the best out of forward Marcus Rashford

                For EVs such as the Tesla Model 3 AWD Performance (OMV S$73,984, or RM245,277) is expected to see an ARF hike of almost S$16,000 (RM53,044)

                Moving up the luxury ladder, the Audi A8 (OMV S$79,392, or RM263,215) gets an ARF hike of almost S$20,000 (RM66,307), while the BMW 7 Series (OMV S$103,000, or RM341,485) gets an ARF hike of more than S$40,000 (RM132,615)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, the OMV is only part of the story of vehicle pricing, and for Singapore, the other significant component in a vehicle’s price tag is the COE or certificate of entitlement, which is a sum paid to the city-state’s land transport authority in order to register a car for road use, and is essentially a quota system to regulate the number of vehicle’s on the country’s roads
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the top COE tier, Category E or the open category, the quota premium is currently S$105,002 (RM348,219)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These adjustments come as part of the Singapore government’s wider efforts toward implementing a “progressive vehicle tax system” for the country’s car market, according to SG Car Mart

                Real Madrid's Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti holds a press conference at the Ciudad Real Madrid training complex in Valdebebas, outskirts of Madrid, on August 19, 2022

                The Real Madrid veteran has faced his issues with form and fitness this season, but Ancelotti has confirmed that he will take to the pitch against Liverpool in midweek

                In addition to a verification badge, the subscription includes “proactive account protection, access to account support, and increased visibility and reach,” a Meta spokesperson said in an email
            </p>
            
            <p>
                is also pushing a subscription offering right now, with account verification being a major selling point

            <p>
                Twitter’s subscription offering has been slow to take off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps the most valuable aspect of Meta’s subscription package will be “increased visibility.” Standing out on Facebook or Instagram is more difficult these days, even among a user’s own followers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unlike Twitter, which does not verify a user’s identity through the subscription, Meta will require users to confirm their identity with a government ID to receive a verification badge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meta is testing the subscription product first in Australia and New Zealand, starting later this week

            </p>

                Besides having the verified badge to prove that an account is authentic, Mark Zuckerberg emphasised that customer support is a big part of the value of Meta Verified subscription
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some have accused Meta of trying to gain extra profit over a necessary feature and users shouldn’t be made to pay a monthly subscription fee for customer service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meta has been plagued with scam ads on its platform and it fails to take action in a timely manner
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Should customer service and action against scams be allowed to be a paid feature? Can Facebook ensure that they won’t approve a Meta Verified subscription from a scammer? Let us know in the comments below.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 19 — Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Mohd Na’im Mokhtar called out the organisers of a PAS Youth parade in Terengganu for being callous with their choice of outfits and portrayal of Islam

                Liverpool are interested in signing Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski this summer, according to journalist Rudy Galetti
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As well as Amrabat, who was courted by Barcelona in this winter transfer season, [Liverpool are also looking at] Merino of Real Sociedad and Zielinski, whose contract will expire in June 2024 and will most likely leave Napoli at the end of the season,” Galetti said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool have been long-term admirers of Zielinski, as the club even made a bid to sign in from Udinese back in 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As demonstrated regularly this season, Liverpool need runners – players who are going to win the ball in the middle of the park
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, now at 28-years-old, he would only add to Liverpool’s aging squad

            <p>
                Therefore, whilst he is obviously dominating for Serie A league leaders Napoli this season, this is an unlikely transfer to be made this summer.

                Following the introduction of the new Uni5G postpaid plans, Telekom Malaysia will stop offering free 5G access for its older Unifi Mobile Ultimate plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As pointed out by @aniq8676, users on the current Ultimate Postpaid plan are told to switch to the newer Uni5G plan in order to enjoy 5G services
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, these subscribers can enjoy 5G as they were given a free unlimited 5G data pass as part of the 5G trial period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We’ve reached out to Telekom Malaysia, and they have confirmed that existing Unifi Mobile Ultimate Plan customers can continue to use the free unlimited 5G pass until the end of February 2023

                The launches come just two days after North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the sea off Japan’s west coast, prompting the United States to hold joint air exercises with South Korea and separately with Japan on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly condemned the launches as a “grave provocation” that should be ceased immediately
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our government has made it clear that North Korea’s provocations will definitely come at a price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Tension on the peninsula is likely to reach its peak in coming months as North Korea is accelerating its military actions with higher frequency, and her statement indicates that it would continue impromptu missile tests using the Pacific as its shooting range,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Park Won-gon, a professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Monday’s missile launch and statement are in line with the North Korean foreign ministry’s recent threat to take “unprecedentedly persistent, strong” responses to the allies’ joint military drills
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “North Korea seems to be trying to reinforce its nuclear capability by raising issue over the drills,” Park said

                The launches come just two days after North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the sea off Japan’s west coast, prompting the United States to hold joint air exercises with South Korea and separately with Japan on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly condemned the launches as a “grave provocation” that should be ceased immediately
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our government has made it clear that North Korea’s provocations will definitely come at a price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Tension on the peninsula is likely to reach its peak in coming months as North Korea is accelerating its military actions with higher frequency, and her statement indicates that it would continue impromptu missile tests using the Pacific as its shooting range,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Park Won-gon, a professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Monday’s missile launch and statement are in line with the North Korean foreign ministry’s recent threat to take “unprecedentedly persistent, strong” responses to the allies’ joint military drills
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “North Korea seems to be trying to reinforce its nuclear capability by raising issue over the drills,” Park said

            <p>
                United haven't looked their best without Casemiro in the two outings against Leeds as they missed his composure on the ball and dominance in the middle of the park so it will come as a great relief that his ban is nearly at a close

                He is bound to be a real threat to United who have been especially susceptible to deliveries into the box recently, something Maddison is an expert in

                Premier League • England Manchester United are willing to stretch to a £250,000 per week wage to keep David de Gea at Old Trafford, according to reports.  But, Erik ten Hag is allegedly already looking at bringing in Leeds United shot-stopper Illan Meslier as his long-term replacement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This new, reported offer is somewhat unexpected, given Ten Hag introduced a rule this season that no United player could earn more than £200,000 per week.  But, the fact that the Dutch coach is willing to compromise to keep De Gea at the club, shows how important he is to the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, according to the Sun, Ten Hag is willing to offer his goalkeeper £200,000 per week to keep him at Old Trafford for at least next season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite De Gea clearly still being important to United, he is already 32 years old, so they are already thinking about a more long-term addition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the Sun’s report, United are very interested in making a move for Leeds’ shot-stopper Meslier and are willing to wait until they can offer him a starting spot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At just 22 years old, the keeper has the potential to get even better than he already is, so United will be hoping that they can seal a deal in the future

                Premier League • England Manchester United are willing to stretch to a £250,000 per week wage to keep David de Gea at Old Trafford, according to reports.  But, Erik ten Hag is allegedly already looking at bringing in Leeds United shot-stopper Illan Meslier as his long-term replacement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This new, reported offer is somewhat unexpected, given Ten Hag introduced a rule this season that no United player could earn more than £200,000 per week.  But, the fact that the Dutch coach is willing to compromise to keep De Gea at the club, shows how important he is to the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, according to the Sun, Ten Hag is willing to offer his goalkeeper £200,000 per week to keep him at Old Trafford for at least next season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite De Gea clearly still being important to United, he is already 32 years old, so they are already thinking about a more long-term addition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the Sun’s report, United are very interested in making a move for Leeds’ shot-stopper Meslier and are willing to wait until they can offer him a starting spot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At just 22 years old, the keeper has the potential to get even better than he already is, so United will be hoping that they can seal a deal in the future

                No pork lard or no pork, no lard? A confusing sign pasted outside a restaurant was what greeted one woman when she was looking around a mall for a Muslim-friendly place to dine

                Sivakumar (pix) said the country’s second rehabilitation centre, costing RM654 million, is expected to be fully completed and operational by the end of 2024 and 400 qualified staff will be employed

            <p>
                In addition, he said the rehabilitation centre would also serve as a sophisticated Centre of Excellence for the Rehabilitation and Return To Work Programme at the global level, thus making it the best national rehabilitation centre in the country, and largest neuro-robotic service centre in Southeast Asia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sivakumar also said that a total of 11,643 patients have undergone physical and vocational rehabilitation at the Tun Abdul Razak Rehabilitation Centre (PRPTAR) in Melaka since it started operating in 2014 until last January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that on an average 30 to 35 per cent of the cases were from the states in the north of the peninsula, so with the rehabilitation centre in Perak, cases from the north could be referred there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if the rehabilitation centre will be built in other states as well, Sivakumar said the government was still mulling over it as it involves high costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Sivakumar visited the workers temporary labour quarters (TLQ) for the Rehabilitation Centre in Ipoh and said he was satisfied with the facilities and equipment provided in the TLQ

                Sivakumar (pix) said the country’s second rehabilitation centre, costing RM654 million, is expected to be fully completed and operational by the end of 2024 and 400 qualified staff will be employed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, he said the rehabilitation centre would also serve as a sophisticated Centre of Excellence for the Rehabilitation and Return To Work Programme at the global level, thus making it the best national rehabilitation centre in the country, and largest neuro-robotic service centre in Southeast Asia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sivakumar also said that a total of 11,643 patients have undergone physical and vocational rehabilitation at the Tun Abdul Razak Rehabilitation Centre (PRPTAR) in Melaka since it started operating in 2014 until last January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that on an average 30 to 35 per cent of the cases were from the states in the north of the peninsula, so with the rehabilitation centre in Perak, cases from the north could be referred there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if the rehabilitation centre will be built in other states as well, Sivakumar said the government was still mulling over it as it involves high costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Sivakumar visited the workers temporary labour quarters (TLQ) for the Rehabilitation Centre in Ipoh and said he was satisfied with the facilities and equipment provided in the TLQ

                About Us Advertise SYDNEY, Feb 19 — The death toll from Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand climbed to 11 today as thousands of people remained missing a week after the storm struck the country’s North Island
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cyclone hit the North Island’s uppermost region on February 12 and tracked down the east coast, inflicting widespread devastation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, police said two more people had died in the hard-hit Hawke’s Bay area in circumstances related to the cyclone, raising the death toll to 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some 5,608 people remained uncontactable across the country, while 1,196 had registered they were safe, police said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of those, almost 40,000 were in Hawke’s Bay, out of a population of about 170,000

            <p>
                Prime Minister Hipkins has said the crisis response is “still underway” and that people across the North Island are “working around the clock.” Police have sent an extra 100 officers to Hawke’s Bay and nearby Tairawhiti, including to isolated areas, and the New Zealand Herald reported roadblocks around a rural Hawke’s Bay village to deter looters

                Liverpool could be in the market for a defensive player in the summer as Jürgen Klopp's staff look to steal a march on Premier League rivals for a 19-year-old talent

            <p>
                With this in mind, one would posit that Klopp's staff are already working in the background to ensure that Liverpool's squad remains future-proofed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Trent Alexander Arnold and youngster Calvin Ramsay possibly representing Liverpool's long-term options in the right full-back areas, it would perhaps make more sense for Mantilla to, therefore, be a long-term option for the Reds in the centre of defense

            <p>
                With question marks currently surrounding Joel Matip's long-term future at Liverpool — he has less than 18 months left on his current contract — one would posit that it makes perfect sense that Jürgen Klopp's staff would be scouring the market for a successor

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, the 19-year-old's ability to potentially play a number of positions across the backline would surely make him an asset for the majority of clubs, including Liverpool

                The Blues' misery under Graham Potter continued on Saturday afternoon, as the Premier League's basement side Southampton won 1-0 at Stamford Bridge thanks to James Ward-Prowse's free kick
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Blues are also facing a last-16 exit from the Champions League following a 1-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund in Wednesday's first leg, with the German side set to visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg on March 7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Out-of-favour striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is also expected to be heading for the exit door at the end of the season, having recently been frozen out of the group under Potter

            <p>
                The former Arsenal man was left out of the Blues' Champions League squad for the knockout stages and has also been cut from the ranks for each of their last three Premier League matches

                © Reuters As is the case with Mount, Aubameyang's contract at Stamford Bridge only runs until 2024, and he has just three goals to show from 17 appearances at the club since arriving from Barcelona

            <p>
                In addition, Hakim Ziyech, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Conor Gallagher are also viewed as expendable assets by Chelsea, who were on the verge of offloading the former to Paris Saint-Germain on loan in January

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Loftus-Cheek now has fewer than 18 months left on his Blues contract, and he has only played 79 minutes of Premier League football for Potter's side since the World Cup

                Welcome to the ESPN Singapore Edition Mark Ogden believes Liverpool will secure a Champions League finish after their 2-0 win over Newcastle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez, 23, scored his first Premier League goal since before the World Cup to set Liverpool on course for a 2-0 win over Newcastle at St James' Park on Saturday -- a win which moves Jurgen Klopp's team up to eighth, six points behind fourth-placed Newcastle with a game in hand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Nunez has hurt his shoulder and he needs further assessment," Klopp said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We don't know any more at the moment, we will have to see, but it is painful for him." Despite closing the gap on Newcastle to revive Liverpool's hopes of a top four finish, Klopp said it is too early to gauge whether his team have finally turned a corner this season
            </p>

                The Reds ended Newcastle's 17-match unbeaten run in the Premier League with a 2-0 win at St James' Park on Saturday.  Jurgen Klopp's side caught Newcastle cold with a scintillating start and the stunned hosts were reduced to ten men in the 22nd minute when Pope was sent off.  The French winger, 25, described the match as 'a very bad day' and pointed out that Pope will miss the Carabao Cup final against Manchester United next Sunday

                Premier League • England Everton have sent ’emissaries’ to keep a close eye on Benfica midfielder Florentino Luis, who they are ‘in love with,’ according to reports.  The Toffees were the only Premier League side not to make any signings in January, so Sean Dyche will be in need of reinforcements this summer, regardless of whether they avoid relegation or not
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Record, via Sport Witness, Everton are ‘in love’ with Florentino and sent ’emissaries’ (scouts) to watch him in Benfica’s 2-0 win over Club Brugge on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, if Florentino could keep up his current form in the Premier League for the Blues next season, he could help turn them into a much better side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Liverpool have also registered an interest in the midfielder, so Everton could have some serious competition on their hands for his signature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Everton have endured another very difficult start to the season, currently sitting in 16th place after winning just five of their 23 opening Premier League matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If they want to avoid another relegation scrap next season (if they survive), Everton need to improve their squad significantly, and signing Florentino would be a marvellous start

                Liverpool beat Newcastle on their own turf on Saturday, with Jürgen Klopp inadvertently sending a message to Eddie Howe as both sides do battle for fourth spot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was not to send a message to Newcastle by any means, but one Klopp moment on the touchline summed up why Liverpool should give itself every hope of beating Eddie Howe's side in the final league standings, at least
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp simply had options that Howe didn't
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Newcastle has, undoubtedly, done well to make itself a part of the conversation for the top four with the squad that Howe has at his disposal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Should Liverpool find sufficient form in the final few months of this particular season, though, it should have more than enough to overhaul Newcastle and make the most of the advantage in depth that it currently has
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is up to the Liverpool players, though, to prove that they are deserving of more top-level European football by finding some consistency at last.

                Liverpool beat Newcastle on their own turf on Saturday, with Jürgen Klopp inadvertently sending a message to Eddie Howe as both sides do battle for fourth spot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was not to send a message to Newcastle by any means, but one Klopp moment on the touchline summed up why Liverpool should give itself every hope of beating Eddie Howe's side in the final league standings, at least
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp simply had options that Howe didn't
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Newcastle has, undoubtedly, done well to make itself a part of the conversation for the top four with the squad that Howe has at his disposal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Should Liverpool find sufficient form in the final few months of this particular season, though, it should have more than enough to overhaul Newcastle and make the most of the advantage in depth that it currently has
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is up to the Liverpool players, though, to prove that they are deserving of more top-level European football by finding some consistency at last.
