                Japanese police have arrested two men on suspicion of shoveling ginger condiment into his mouth directly from a communal container with his chopsticks at a famous beef bowl restaurant in western Japan, a latest in the series of food pranks that had earlier hit sushi chains and known as ‘sushi terrorism’

                Gou stepped down as Foxconn chief in 2019 and made a presidential bid that year, but dropped out after losing the race to win the nomination for the KMT

                Gou stepped down as Foxconn chief in 2019 and made a presidential bid that year, but dropped out after losing the race to win the nomination for the KMT, which traditionally favours close ties with China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking to reporters at a hotel next to Taiwan’s main international airport at Taoyuan on his return from a week-long trip to the United States, Gou said the only way to avoid war with China was to lessen Sino-US tensions and get Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) out of office
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We must honestly tell young people that it is dangerous to vote for the DPP, which ‘exalts Taiwan independence and hates and opposes China’,” Gou said, citing a wording Taiwan opposition parties typically use to describe the DPP’s politics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Peace is not taken for granted, and people need to make the correct choice.” The KMT is still in the process of choosing its candidate for the next presidential election, due in January 2024, with Hou Yu-ih the front-runner

                Malaysia-China Friendship and Mutual Aid Association adviser Datuk Seri Michael Chong said the incident, of which a video about it has gone viral on social media, only had one side of the story

                “The viral video only presented a possible version of the story, thus it is important that she come forward and explain the matter, including giving her statement to the police,” he told a press conference at Wisma MCA yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chong noted the role played by the association, that is to be a bridge between both nations and to assist their citizens

            <p>

                Malaysia-China Friendship and Mutual Aid Association adviser Datuk Seri Michael Chong said the incident, of which a video about it has gone viral on social media, only had one side of the story
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The association is urging the tourist to come forward so that we can assist her and help get to the truth of the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The viral video only presented a possible version of the story, thus it is important that she come forward and explain the matter, including giving her statement to the police,” he told a press conference at Wisma MCA yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chong noted the role played by the association, that is to be a bridge between both nations and to assist their citizens
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The tourist has nothing to fear as all we want is to assist her,” he said

            <p>
                According to the charge sheet, the 49-year-old accused allegedly offered a bribe of RM500,000 per year for 15 years to an individual as an inducement and for the benefit of former communications and multimedia minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa to expedite the acquisition by Hydroshoppe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The offence was allegedly committed at the ministry’s office in Putrajaya between July and August last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the charge sheet, the company allegedly committed an offence as its associate Abdul Hamid had offered the same bribe to the same individual for the benefit of Annuar with the same intention

            <p>

                Hydropshoppe Sdn Bhd director Datuk Abdul Hamid Shaikh Abdul Razak Shaikh pleaded not guilty before Sessions Court judge Suzana Hussain yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the charge sheet, the 49-year-old accused allegedly offered a bribe of RM500,000 per year for 15 years to an individual as an inducement and for the benefit of former communications and multimedia minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa to expedite the acquisition by Hydroshoppe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The offence was allegedly committed at the ministry’s office in Putrajaya between July and August last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the charge sheet, the company allegedly committed an offence as its associate Abdul Hamid had offered the same bribe to the same individual for the benefit of Annuar with the same intention
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abdul Hamid claimed trial as the company’s director

                (Bloomberg) -- Frank founder Charlie Javice was released on a $2 million bond after being charged with defrauding JPMorgan Chase & Co

                While this is not the bank’s first VCC, what made the new card stands out from the bank’s earlier VCC releases is a feature called the Dynamic Card Number
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The general idea behind the Dynamic Card Number is to provide an additional layer of security to the VCC holders as it enables them to mask the VCC’s actual card number
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That being said, the Dynamic Card Number feature still can be used for recurring payments that require the card number to be valid for a much longer period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cardholders can also choose to customise the visual design of the card to make it easier for them to recognise each card number that they have obtained through the dynamic number generator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aside from the dynamic card number functionality, cardholders can also freeze and unfreeze as well as delete any of the dynamic card numbers that were generated under the VCC directly through the allianceonline mobile app without the need to call Alliance Bank’s customer service

                While this is not the bank’s first VCC, what made the new card stands out from the bank’s earlier VCC releases is a feature called the Dynamic Card Number
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The general idea behind the Dynamic Card Number is to provide an additional layer of security to the VCC holders as it enables them to mask the VCC’s actual card number
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That being said, the Dynamic Card Number feature still can be used for recurring payments that require the card number to be valid for a much longer period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cardholders can also choose to customise the visual design of the card to make it easier for them to recognise each card number that they have obtained through the dynamic number generator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aside from the dynamic card number functionality, cardholders can also freeze and unfreeze as well as delete any of the dynamic card numbers that were generated under the VCC directly through the allianceonline mobile app without the need to call Alliance Bank’s customer service
            </p>

                Malaysia Retail Electronic Cigarette Association (MRECA) president Datuk Adzwan Manas said the approach was appropriate given the vape industry had been developed by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and local entrepreneurs

                Meanwhile, Malaysian Organisation of Vape Entity (MOVE) president Samsul Kamal Ariffin said his team has been fighting for almost 13 years for the vape industry to be regulated

            <p>
                "We understand and accept the move to impose a tax because this is part of the regulatory framework," he said

                On April 1, the media reported that the government through a Federal Government gazette imposed an excise tax of 40 sen per millilitre on vape liquids for e-cigarettes

                China and EU decoupling will only serve US interests, but make both China and Europe suffer," it said.

                Production of the all-electric, third-generation MINI Countryman will commence in November this year at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig, Germany, and thus marks the first time a MINI model is produced in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Powertrain for the Countryman SE is likely shared with the BMW iX1, which is currently offered in a sole xDrive30 variant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is currently no single-motor variant of the iX1, so given that the BMW and MINI crossover models share the UKL (Unter Klasse) platform for transverse-engined models, the Countryman E could offer a glimpse at what a future ‘sDrive20’ variant of the BWM iX1 could offer in terms of powertrain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both the single-motor Countryman E and dual-motor Countryman SE are powered by a 64.kWh battery pack; range is quoted as an estimated 450 km, which is likely to be the best figure between the two variants as offered by the more modestly powered single-motor variant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The upcoming third-generation MINI Countryman is touted to have greater environmental consideration in its production, in addition to offering zero tailpipe emissions

            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was responding to Anwar's remarks on Monday (April 3) that Malaysia was open to holding talks with China on its oil and gas claims in the South China Sea but would not back down from its own territorial claims

                The Prime Minister had said oil drills by PETRONAS would continue as the oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea were an important revenue source for Malaysia, adding that he raised this issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his official visit to China last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that in the past, there were several reported encounters by PETRONAS operating oil and gas fields in the South China Sea within Malaysia's EEZ with Chinese vessels

                French President Emmanuel Macron speaks during a meeting with China's French community at the residence of France's ambassador in Beijing on Apr 5, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking at a gathering of the French community in Beijing ahead of a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, Macron said that France would seek to work with China "in this shared responsibility for peace and stability" in Ukraine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Macron's aims also include preserving and rebalancing China's trade ties with Europe, as well as safeguarding French interests in the Asia-Pacific region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We must not disassociate ourselves, separate ourselves from China," Macron told Beijing's French community upon arrival, saying France would "commit proactively to continue to have a commercial relationship with China"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Macron discussed his trip to China and support for Ukraine during a phone call with United States President Joe Biden on the eve of his visit, the White House said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a speech last week, Von der Leyen cautioned Beijing against direct support for the war in Ukraine, while ruling out the European Union "decoupling" from China.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 — Alliance Bank Malaysia today launched a virtual credit card with the country’s first “dynamic card number” feature, offering enhanced security for online transactions at a time of worsening scams and cybersecurity threats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new Alliance Bank Visa Virtual Credit Card will let users generate an unlimited number of digital cards for online transactions, including on e-commerce websites and online services that require subscriptions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alliance Bank group chief executive officer Kellee Kam said that for a seamless experience, all processes involved would be done through the bank’s mobile application, including registration for the virtual credit card
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Users will have two options when creating the virtual card numbers, one for a disposable single-use, and the other for recurring payments or subscriptions — which will then present as separate virtual credit cards on the Alliance Bank app
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kam said that the dynamic card number feature creates an additional layer of protection for users and they can worry less about data breaches on websites where they provide credit card information, as the one-time use card numbers will no longer be functioning while the recurring-use card numbers will have limits on them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As part of their introductory promotion, Alliance Bank will offer a RM15.90 cashback for each recurring payment set through their virtual credit card from April 5 to September 30 this year — with the amount doubled (up to five subscriptions) for the first 12,000 RinggitPlus customers that get approved to use the virtual card

                The lawyers said they sent a letter of concern to ChatGPT owner OpenAI on March 21, which gave OpenAI 28 days to fix the errors about their client or face a possible defamation lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                OpenAI did not respond to a Reuters email out of business hours

                Microsoft Corp integrated ChatGPT into its search engine Bing in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It would potentially be a landmark moment in the sense that it's applying this defamation law to a new area of artificial intelligence and publication in the IT space," James Naughton, a partner at Hood's lawfirm Gordon Legal, told Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Hood files a lawsuit, it would accuse ChatGPT of giving users a false sense of accuracy by failing to include footnotes, Naughton said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It's very difficult for somebody to look behind that to say 'how does the algorithm come up with that answer?'" said Naughton

                The judge also said that if such public disclosure of the investigation report requires any related action by the Australian government, the Malaysian government must immediately ensure Canberra acted accordingly to allow the declassification to be done promptly.

                Zuraida said she is still aiming to focus on a multi-ethnic party, and would still support Perikatan Nasional (PN) — of which Bersatu is a lynchpin party — in the upcoming state elections this year

                She and others in the exodus from PKR would later join Bersatu in August 2020

                Zuraida said she is still aiming to focus on a multi-ethnic party, and would still support Perikatan Nasional (PN) — of which Bersatu is a lynchpin party — in the upcoming state elections this year

                She and others in the exodus from PKR would later join Bersatu in August 2020

                However, after an internal altercation, Zuraida left Bersatu in May 2022 to join PBM

                The India market H-D differs from the Harley-Davidson X350 developed in collaboration with Chinese bike maker QJ Motor and launched recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The China market small H-D carries a parallel-twin engine displacing 353 cc and mechanicals are shared with the the QJ SRK 350
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Official naming for the India market H-D has yet to emerge but our source says it is likely the engine was developed for it by Hero MotoCorp of India, known for its engine collaborations with other manufacturers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Hero assuming management of H-D India‘s operations in 2020, this would make a good case for a product leveraging on the New Delhi firm’s facilities and resources

                The instrument cluster is a single round binnacle with LCD readout showing a digital speedometer with LCD tachometer that reads up to 8,000 rpm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No further information was available as to market launch for this H-D but our source says the bike is production ready and expected to launch probably by this year

                Loh was pursuing contempt of court proceedings against the ex-husband, over his failure to comply with a previous court order which granted her sole custody of her three children
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, High Court judge Evrol Mariette Peters ruled that the ex-husband was actually well aware of what he had done, and that he had gone missing in order to avoid being detected and to evade the court order granting custody of the children to Loh, news portal Malaysiakini reported
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysiakini cited the judge as saying that the ex-husband had tried to avoid being served with court documents on the contempt of court matter, and that he could not use his own conduct to complain that he was not given those court documents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Malaysiakini, the ex-husband is seeking a stay of the court's order for him to pay RM20,000 for contempt of court, as he is pursuing an appeal at the Court of Appeal against today's decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the March 2021 decision which gave her full custody of the three children, Loh was still separated from them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Separately, the High Court is scheduled to deliver its decision on May 11 on Loh's challenge and bid to cancel the unilateral conversion of her three children to Islam.

            <p>

                The company was charged under Section 17A of the MACC Act, which came into effect on June 1, 2020

                Sessions Court judge Azura Alwi ordered the prosecution to produce the forensic report, used in Gnanaraja's trial in Shah Alam and containing WhatsApp messages between him and Zarul, to the defence within two weeks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azura said the court was satisfied with the defence’s submission that two different courts — the Sessions Court here, and the Shah Alam Sessions Court — heard two different versions of testimonies as to who received the RM2 million cash and the purpose of the payment, despite the same payment vouchers and bank cheques being used as evidence to their withdrawals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Based on the notes of proceedings and written statements of the witnesses in [Gnanaraja’s trial in the] Shah Alam court, the court found that the applicant (Lim) had successfully demonstrated the fact that in the Shah Alam court, payment vouchers and Public Bank cheques had been used to withdraw RM2 million, which was said to have been handed over to Gnanaraja
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zarul previously testified before the Sessions Court here that when he and Gnanaraja communicated via WhatsApp, the pair utilised the terms “Bigboss” to refer to Lim, and “chocolate” for the RM2 million cash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution previously shared that they plan to call Gnanaraja to the witness stand in Lim’s trial

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azura said the court was satisfied with the defence’s submission that two different courts — the Sessions Court here, and the Shah Alam Sessions Court — heard two different versions of testimonies as to who received the RM2 million cash and the purpose of the payment, despite the same payment vouchers and bank cheques being used as evidence to their withdrawals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Based on the notes of proceedings and written statements of the witnesses in [Gnanaraja’s trial in the] Shah Alam court, the court found that the applicant (Lim) had successfully demonstrated the fact that in the Shah Alam court, payment vouchers and Public Bank cheques had been used to withdraw RM2 million, which was said to have been handed over to Gnanaraja
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court found the matter relevant, Azura said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zarul previously testified before the Sessions Court here that when he and Gnanaraja communicated via WhatsApp, the pair utilised the terms “Bigboss” to refer to Lim, and “chocolate” for the RM2 million cash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution previously shared that they plan to call Gnanaraja to the witness stand in Lim’s trial

                “More than 50% of the $2.9 trillion in commercial mortgages will need to be renegotiated in the next 24 months when new lending rates are likely to be up by 350 to 450 basis points,” Shalett writes

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 — A director for the firm Hydroshoppe Sdn Bhd today claimed trial at the Session Court to the charge of giving bribes to former minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa in return for favours to handle concessions for the Kuala Lumpur Tower
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is said to have offered bribes to Annuar to speed up the approvals for his company to handle the administration and operations of iconic Kuala Lumpur landmark
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The charges were read in front of Judge Suzana Husin who then set bail at RM50,000 and asked Abdul Hamid to report himself to the MACC headquarters in Kuala Lumpur once every two months beginning in May this year until the trial is over

            <p>
                Prior to this, the MACC was reported to have investigated allegations over the suspicious sale of shares and the take-over of the KL Tower operations and maintenance concession from Menara Kuala Lumpur Sdn Bhd, a company wholly owned by Telekom Malaysia (TM) Bhd
            </p>
            
            <p>

                State Works, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman Mohamad Fazli Mohamad Salleh said the Johor government is committed to ensuring that the high-impact public transport project will be operational in 2026

                "To ensure this project development runs smoothly, a task force was set up on Oct 21, 2020 to help facilitate any matter related to the state government such as land issues and so forth, with PLANMalaysia Johor as its secretariat

            <p>
                So far we are running on schedule and the project development is closely monitored by the Transport Ministry," he told a press conference after visiting the Johor Baru-Singapore RTS Link site at Marine Viaduct here, on Tuesday (April 4)

                Liverpool have been linked with a transfer move for Moisés Caicedo this summer, but may be missing an even better solution in the form of a Man United 'hijack'

            <p>

                Ultimately, Caicedo is a sensible target, but the same applies to his teammate, Mac Allister

                The minister said TH has strived to maintain the level of profit distribution at the level of previous years, although the state of the investment environment in 2022 was tough for all investment institutions

                In 2022, the hajj fund also had to bear hajj costs and hajj financial assistance after an absence of hajj operations in the previous two years,” he said

                (AP) — Union Pacific routinely hires private investigators to check out employees' medical leave claims and then fires anyone who happens to leave their house while out on leave, according to a lawsuit filed against the railroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific says it didn’t do anything wrong when it fired De’Ron Rutledge because railroad managers believed he was abusing the medical leave rules by repeatedly taking time off as he was recovering from a back injury he suffered on the job
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spokeswoman Robynn Tysver said UP follows all the rules for providing Family Medical Leave Act time off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If we learn that an employee is misusing FMLA, Union Pacific may take disciplinary action, as permitted under the law.” This whole situation might be less of a problem if employees had paid sick time, but the railroads have only started to address that concern in recent months through agreements giving some of their unions four days of paid sick time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to his lawsuit, Rutledge had to take eight months off work to rehabilitate after the back injury in 2017 but after returning to the job he would occasionally need to take additional time off when his back condition flared up
            </p>

                ___ This story has been updated to correct that most conductors have not, rather than have, received paid sick time leave.

            <p>
                Transnational criminal organisations are combining confidence scams with technological savvy to swindle Americans out of their hard-earned funds, said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite, Jr., of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division

                The scam is also referred to as a romance scheme, where the scammer develops a relationship and gains the trust of the victim before encouraging them to invest in cryptocurrency trading

            <p>

                Judges in the District of Arizona, the Central District of California, and the District of Idaho authorised the seizure warrants for six virtual currency accounts, which were allegedly used to launder funds from various cryptocurrency confidence scams, the Justice Department announced Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Transnational criminal organisations are combining confidence scams with technological savvy to swindle Americans out of their hard-earned funds, said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite, Jr., of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the FBI, investment fraud caused the highest losses out of any scam in 2022, totalling US$3.31 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The scam is also referred to as a romance scheme, where the scammer develops a relationship and gains the trust of the victim before encouraging them to invest in cryptocurrency trading
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Financial fraud schemes like these demonstrate the great lengths criminals will take to swindle innocent victims out of their money,” said Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Be wary of people you meet online; seriously question investment advice, especially about cryptocurrency, from people you have not met in person; and remember, investments that seem too good to be true, usually are

                LUKE SHAW is "petulant" and "can't be trusted" - claims former Manchester United star Paul Parker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He feels like he is the best player on the team and if it’s not going his way he wants to pick up the ball and go home
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Way more games than I did, so you would expect more from him but he is not a leader
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You should want to die for Man United and it makes me think that he is not a player that should play for Man United, when he is not acting like that." Shaw, 27, spoke of his excitement at the opportunity to "create something special" under Erik ten Hag after penning his new deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He does need the opportunity to get himself going at the end of the season

                In a statement on Tuesday (April 4), the department said this was because the earthquake occurred at a depth of 611 kilometres (km) and no aftershocks were triggered after close observation

            <p>
                The MetMalaysia National Seismic Network detected the earthquake with a magnitude of 4.4 at 6.45 degrees North and 115.87 degrees East in the South China Sea at 3.32 am

                According to MetMalaysia, based on the fifth edition of the Department of Minerals and Geoscience (JMG) 2009 seismtectonic map, the earthquake was located in an area of ‘inactive thrust fault’

                In a statement on Tuesday (April 4), the department said this was because the earthquake occurred at a depth of 611 kilometres (km) and no aftershocks were triggered after close observation

            <p>
                The MetMalaysia National Seismic Network detected the earthquake with a magnitude of 4.4 at 6.45 degrees North and 115.87 degrees East in the South China Sea at 3.32 am

                According to MetMalaysia, based on the fifth edition of the Department of Minerals and Geoscience (JMG) 2009 seismtectonic map, the earthquake was located in an area of ‘inactive thrust fault’

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, April 4 — The Federal Court here today struck out an application by two Sabahans to get leave to appeal to reinstate a lawsuit against PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang for alleged seditious remarks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohamad Zabidin, who delivered the court’s unanimous in an online proceeding, struck out the application with no order as to costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 7, 2021, High Court judge Datuk Akhtar Tahir allowed Abdul Hadi’s application to strike out the suit filed by the two men, who then lost their appeal which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on Aug 16 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court was supposed to hear their application for leave to appeal today, but Abdul Hadi’s lawyer, Yusfarizal Yussoff, raised a preliminary objection saying that there was no valid affidavit to support the application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yusfarizal, assisted by lawyer Adam Luqman Amdan, also said there was no application made by the applicants to seek leave of the court to use the defective affidavit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He told the court that attempts to get in touch with Maklin to affirm the affidavit were unsuccessful and requested the court to give him another chance to get the affidavit affirmed

            <p>
                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, April 4 — The Federal Court here today struck out an application by two Sabahans to get leave to appeal to reinstate a lawsuit against PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang for alleged seditious remarks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohamad Zabidin, who delivered the court’s unanimous in an online proceeding, struck out the application with no order as to costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 7, 2021, High Court judge Datuk Akhtar Tahir allowed Abdul Hadi’s application to strike out the suit filed by the two men, who then lost their appeal which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on Aug 16 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court was supposed to hear their application for leave to appeal today, but Abdul Hadi’s lawyer, Yusfarizal Yussoff, raised a preliminary objection saying that there was no valid affidavit to support the application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yusfarizal, assisted by lawyer Adam Luqman Amdan, also said there was no application made by the applicants to seek leave of the court to use the defective affidavit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He told the court that attempts to get in touch with Maklin to affirm the affidavit were unsuccessful and requested the court to give him another chance to get the affidavit affirmed
            </p>

                But for users of Western Digital NAS, this has been made impossible following a recent hack that the company suffered, which prompted the temporary shutting down of its My Cloud service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement, Western Digital says that the “network security incident” happened on 26 March, two weekends ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As part of the incident, the hacker has “gained access to a number of the company’s systems”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On one hand, it makes sense, as the hacker may have access to user data as part of said company’s systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking of disrupted services, it’s safe to say that everything that is related to the Western Digital My Cloud service is rendered inoperable, at least temporarily

                But it does mean that you’ll have to be connected to the same wireless network to access them, rather than just anywhere with an internet connection

                But for users of Western Digital NAS, this has been made impossible following a recent hack that the company suffered, which prompted the temporary shutting down of its My Cloud service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement, Western Digital says that the “network security incident” happened on 26 March, two weekends ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As part of the incident, the hacker has “gained access to a number of the company’s systems”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On one hand, it makes sense, as the hacker may have access to user data as part of said company’s systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking of disrupted services, it’s safe to say that everything that is related to the Western Digital My Cloud service is rendered inoperable, at least temporarily
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it does mean that you’ll have to be connected to the same wireless network to access them, rather than just anywhere with an internet connection

                The fast food chain restaurant is shuttering its US offices this week as the company prepares to restructure and inform employees about layoffs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fast-food chain told corporate staff to work remotely Monday through Wednesday to provide confidentiality while it cuts hundreds of jobs, according to a person familiar with the company’s plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Workers at Alphabet Inc’s Google have criticised the company’s recent mass layoffs and called for, among other things, future job cuts to be conducted in person so that employees can say goodbye to colleagues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even though remote layoffs can be more efficient and less awkward for everyone involved, some experts say the norm should still be to break the news in person whenever possible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the past when a company had a large-scale layoff, such as a plant closure, the bosses would gather everyone together and tell them at the same time, said Sandra Sucher, a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School who studies trust between employers and employees

                The group’s spokesman told New Straits Times that the strike was not noticeable as there were 30 per cent less patients yesterday following news of the planned strike
            </p>
            
            <p>
                the patient rate was reduced by 30 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It reportedly justified the "success" by saying that medical officers had to carry out the duties usually run by house officers instead, since some contract doctors had taken leave in conjunction with the strike
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spokesman also said that the strike — ongoing until tomorrow — is just an "early warning" for the Health Ministry and the next strike will be “more devastating” should things stay the same for contract doctors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spokesman also said the group is satisfied that the issues affecting contract doctors have been highlighted to the public and also politicians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group is demanding the absorption of all contract medical officers into permanent positions, basic salary increments, higher on-call rates, and an automatic reduction in the compulsory service term for medical officers to three years

                The group’s spokesman told New Straits Times that the strike was not noticeable as there were 30 per cent less patients yesterday following news of the planned strike
            </p>
            
            <p>
                the patient rate was reduced by 30 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It reportedly justified the "success" by saying that medical officers had to carry out the duties usually run by house officers instead, since some contract doctors had taken leave in conjunction with the strike
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spokesman also said that the strike — ongoing until tomorrow — is just an "early warning" for the Health Ministry and the next strike will be “more devastating” should things stay the same for contract doctors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spokesman also said the group is satisfied that the issues affecting contract doctors have been highlighted to the public and also politicians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group is demanding the absorption of all contract medical officers into permanent positions, basic salary increments, higher on-call rates, and an automatic reduction in the compulsory service term for medical officers to three years

                It said that the Act was an unsuitable framework for vape products containing nicotine and the exemption would allow proper regulation through amendments of existing laws such as the Control of Tobacco Product Regulations 2004
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nicotine previously fell under the purview of the Act, which stated that it, along with all preparations of tobacco, was classified as a Group C poison for the purposes of the legislation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said that the removal of nicotine from the Poisons Act before passing the Tobacco Control Bill will give children open access to vape products containing nicotine, possibly leading to a new generation of addicts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amrahi said that under the Act, nicotine is a Class C poison that can only be procured and dispensed by licensed pharmacists and medical practitioners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Where does the issue stand right now? Last Friday (March 31), the federal government gazetted an excise duty for vape liquids with nicotine content at 40 sen per millilitre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa said on Saturday (April 1) that her ministry will table a new law to regulate nicotine use which will include the Generation End Game (GEG) policy

                It said that the Act was an unsuitable framework for vape products containing nicotine and the exemption would allow proper regulation through amendments of existing laws such as the Control of Tobacco Product Regulations 2004
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nicotine previously fell under the purview of the Act, which stated that it, along with all preparations of tobacco, was classified as a Group C poison for the purposes of the legislation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said that the removal of nicotine from the Poisons Act before passing the Tobacco Control Bill will give children open access to vape products containing nicotine, possibly leading to a new generation of addicts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amrahi said that under the Act, nicotine is a Class C poison that can only be procured and dispensed by licensed pharmacists and medical practitioners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Where does the issue stand right now? Last Friday (March 31), the federal government gazetted an excise duty for vape liquids with nicotine content at 40 sen per millilitre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa said on Saturday (April 1) that her ministry will table a new law to regulate nicotine use which will include the Generation End Game (GEG) policy

                About Us Advertise   SINGAPORE, April 4 — A 50-year-old United States citizen who jumped bail here has been extradited back to Singapore and charged yesterday (April 3) with running a bogus investment scheme
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The scheme collected about S$18 million (RM60 million) from more than 1,000 investors but was not actually involved in any substantive level of investment, the Singapore police said in a statement yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Michael Philip Atkins was charged in court yesterday with knowingly being a party to carrying on a business with a fraudulent purpose, the police said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Atkins was a director and shareholder of Aureus Capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In July 2014, Atkins was arrested and released on police bail while under investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The whereabouts of Atkins were traced with the assistance of the authorities in the US and he was successfully extradited to Singapore on March 18, 2023,” police said

                The scheme collected about S$18 million (RM60 million) from more than 1,000 investors but was not actually involved in any substantive level of investment, the Singapore police said in a statement yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Michael Philip Atkins was charged in court yesterday with knowingly being a party to carrying on a business with a fraudulent purpose, the police said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Atkins was a director and shareholder of Aureus Capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In July 2014, Atkins was arrested and released on police bail while under investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The whereabouts of Atkins were traced with the assistance of the authorities in the US and he was successfully extradited to Singapore on March 18, 2023,” police said
            </p>

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Manchester United have opened talks to sign Bayer Leverkusen right-back Jeremie Frimpong, according to reports in Germany
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United news, exclusives and analysis United have made the signing of a new striker their top priority for the summer but it’s understood that Erik ten Hag is keen to recruit a new right-sided defender
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Frimpong, meanwhile, has been one of Leverkusen’s standout performers this season and is the team’s joint-top scorer in the Bundesliga this season with eight goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Sky Germany, United have now begun ‘concrete talks’ with Frimpong’s representatives ahead of the summer transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report claims that Leverkusen will be holding out for a €40 million (£35m) transfer fee for the 22-year-old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Frimpong came through Manchester City’s youth academy but failed to make a first-team appearance before he joined Celtic in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defender won the domestic treble in his first season at Celtic but spent just 16 months with the Scottish club before he joined Leverkusen in 2021

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Manchester United have opened talks to sign Bayer Leverkusen right-back Jeremie Frimpong, according to reports in Germany
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United news, exclusives and analysis United have made the signing of a new striker their top priority for the summer but it’s understood that Erik ten Hag is keen to recruit a new right-sided defender
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Frimpong, meanwhile, has been one of Leverkusen’s standout performers this season and is the team’s joint-top scorer in the Bundesliga this season with eight goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Sky Germany, United have now begun ‘concrete talks’ with Frimpong’s representatives ahead of the summer transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report claims that Leverkusen will be holding out for a €40 million (£35m) transfer fee for the 22-year-old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Frimpong came through Manchester City’s youth academy but failed to make a first-team appearance before he joined Celtic in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defender won the domestic treble in his first season at Celtic but spent just 16 months with the Scottish club before he joined Leverkusen in 2021

                After a relatively disappointing run in the DPC season, OG managed to bounce back and win some crucial matches, keeping the team in the running to potentially secure enough DPC points for The International 2023.  In a recent post-match interview, the team’s offlane player, Dmitry “DM” Dorokhin gave his thoughts on the team’s performance in the DPC and its thought process going forward.  OG’s DM believes that his team is capable of performing at much higher levels than they are currently

            <p>
                - Inside story of why Chelsea sacked Graham Potter Sources have told ESPN that Julian Nagelsmann is on the shortlist, while the club are expected to sound out Mauricio Pochettino and Luis Enrique over the role
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There had also been speculation that De Zerbi was a potential candidate for Chelsea, given his success since replacing Potter at Brighton, but sources close to Chelsea have confirmed he is not of interest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that no appointment is imminent with Chelsea set to adopt a different approach in hiring Potter's successor, with the search set to be led by sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart
            </p>

                - Inside story of why Chelsea sacked Graham Potter Sources have told ESPN that Julian Nagelsmann is on the shortlist, while the club are expected to sound out Mauricio Pochettino and Luis Enrique over the role
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There had also been speculation that De Zerbi was a potential candidate for Chelsea, given his success since replacing Potter at Brighton, but sources close to Chelsea have confirmed he is not of interest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that no appointment is imminent with Chelsea set to adopt a different approach in hiring Potter's successor, with the search set to be led by sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - Potter was wrong choice for Chelsea from the start
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Potter's former assistant Bruno Saltor will take interim charge of the first team for Tuesday's Premier League home clash with Liverpool

                KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Reuters) - Malaysia's parliament on Monday passed sweeping legal reforms to remove the mandatory death penalty, trim the number of offences punishable by death, and abolish natural-life prison sentences, a move cautiously welcomed by rights groups

            <p>
                Under the amendments passed, alternatives to the death penalty include whipping and imprisonment of between 30 to 40 years

                Acting Kuala Lumpur police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Yahaya Othman said in a statement on Monday (April 3) that the video apparently showed a policeman conducting an inspection near the Memorial Tunku Abdul Rahman signboard at Bulatan Datuk Onn here

            <p>
                "Preliminary investigations showed that the complainant alleged in a video that the extortion occurred after (she failed) to produce identification," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier in the day, it was alleged in a TikTok video that a Chinese national had been extorted after she failed to produce her passport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The video includes the police stop but it gets cut off after the officer asks for identification.

            <p>
                Abdul Rahman, who was chairing the five-judge bench, was the only judge who dissented or disagreed with the majority

            <p>
                On July 28, 2020, then High Court judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali found Najib guilty of all seven charges — three for criminal breach of trust, three for money laundering, and one for abuse of power — at the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Nazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal judge, then sentenced Najib to 12 years in prison and fined him RM210 million in default five years imprisonment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on December 8, 2021.

                Erik ten Hag was surprised Manchester United's players failed to match the intensity of Newcastle in their 2-0 defeat on what he admitted was "not a good day"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Newcastle had 22 attempts to United's six in a dominant performance that lifted them above Ten Hag's team into third place in the Premier League table
            </p>

                United beat Newcastle 2-0 in the League Cup final five weeks ago and Ten Hag felt that was a source of motivation for the hosts and Luke Shaw said Newcastle "wanted it more"

                Luke Shaw admitted Manchester United's players had a frank discussion among themselves in the dressing room following Sunday's 2-0 defeat to Newcastle United at St James' Park
            </p>

                The Land Public Transport Agency (Apad) said the extension was in line with the Transport Ministry's objective to improve the country's transport system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, to qualify for the extension, the vehicle must have reached the previous maximum age limit of 10 years on or after Jan 1

            <p>
                Apad said it hoped the extension would help taxi and ehailing operators to improve the quality of their services to become a trusted transportation mode of choice by the people

                The new target price represents a 21% upside against a last traded price of $33
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lower target price also takes into account a lower environmental, social and governance (ESG) premium, according to RHB’s proprietary methodology
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the latest glitch, RHB analysts further slash DBS’s ESG score to 3.1, which effectively lowers the stock’s ESG premium to 2% from 4%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This brings RHB’s final target price to $39.80 based on an intrinsic value of $39.05 with the lower 2% ESG premium
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The slash in target price also takes into account a slight “bump up” in equity risk premium given the recent banking sector turmoil in the US and the EU, add RHB’s analysts

                DBS Group’s D05 % D05DBS GROUP HOLDINGS LTDBANKING & INVESTMENT SERVICESS$  %More on Edge Investdigital banking service disruption last week was but a “transitory dampener”, say RHB Bank Singapore’s analysts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new target price represents a 21% upside against a last traded price of $33
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lower target price also takes into account a lower environmental, social and governance (ESG) premium, according to RHB’s proprietary methodology
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the latest glitch, RHB analysts further slash DBS’s ESG score to 3.1, which effectively lowers the stock’s ESG premium to 2% from 4%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This brings RHB’s final target price to $39.80 based on an intrinsic value of $39.05 with the lower 2% ESG premium
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The slash in target price also takes into account a slight “bump up” in equity risk premium given the recent banking sector turmoil in the US and the EU, add RHB’s analysts

                One player who reportedly figures 'high' on Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp's list of summer transfer targets has shown he can help restore the team's identity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea would be willing to 'at least consider an approach' for Gallagher, who figures 'high up' on Liverpool's list
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He could engineer the kind of turnovers Liverpool so often used to punish the opposition in its pomp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reminiscent of a prime Jordan Henderson in some respects, Gallagher could also be an ideal long-term successor to Liverpool's captain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Many Liverpool fans probably wouldn't be all that excited by the signing, particularly because he hasn't been able to nail down a place in the first XI at Stamford Bridge, starting just 10 out of 28 league games so far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Gallagher was willing to accept that kind of status, sweetened by the promise of unlocking his full potential under Klopp, then he could be one of the new faces that helps Liverpool rediscover its identity.

                One player who reportedly figures 'high' on Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp's list of summer transfer targets has shown he can help restore the team's identity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea would be willing to 'at least consider an approach' for Gallagher, who figures 'high up' on Liverpool's list
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He could engineer the kind of turnovers Liverpool so often used to punish the opposition in its pomp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reminiscent of a prime Jordan Henderson in some respects, Gallagher could also be an ideal long-term successor to Liverpool's captain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Many Liverpool fans probably wouldn't be all that excited by the signing, particularly because he hasn't been able to nail down a place in the first XI at Stamford Bridge, starting just 10 out of 28 league games so far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Gallagher was willing to accept that kind of status, sweetened by the promise of unlocking his full potential under Klopp, then he could be one of the new faces that helps Liverpool rediscover its identity.

                Potter signed a five-year deal to replace Tuchel, with Chelsea paying his £21m buyout clause to release him from Brighton

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sadly, no one can be averse to criticism based on Liverpool's current campaign, and that also includes Virgil van Dijk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Van Dijk is not getting any younger
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Neither are most of the Liverpool center-back options at Klopp's disposal at the moment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is what they might do according to a report from Foot Mercato, which claims Liverpool is 'very interested' in Napoli's South Korean sensation Kim Min-jae

                "We are on track to achieve the targets -- for example, this year, for inflation to be between 2.8 per cent and 3.8 per cent and economic growth to be between four and five per cent,” he told reporters after the annual BNM Governor's Address on the Malaysian Economy forum organised by the Malaysian Economic Association today

                Earlier in his keynote address, Fraziali said the monetary policy would continue to balance the risks to domestic inflation and economic growth and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will continue to monitor the impact of the past OPR adjustments on the economy

            <p>

            <p>
                According to the BNM Economic and Monetary Review 2022, the MPC monetary policy considerations would focus on managing inflation risks while supporting sustainable economic growth in 2023, and similar to other economies, 2023 will be a challenging year for the Malaysian economy with a more moderate economic growth projected and inflation expected to remain elevated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus in the report said over-adjustments in monetary policy would negatively impact growth, while undershooting could lead to inflation expectations becoming unhinged with damaging effects on consumers’ purchasing power and the sustainability of economic growth

            <p>

                Meanwhile, the bench dismissed Muhammad Sanusi’s appeal to set aside the High Court’s decision, made on November 8, 2021, which ordered him to pay damages to Mahfuz after allowing the latter’s (Mahfuz) defamation lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the court’s decision, Justice Vazeer said that there was no error by the High Court judge in his findings on liability, but said that the quantum of damages awarded to Mahfuz by the High Court was low

            <p>
                In November 2021, High Court Judicial Commissioner Datuk Mohd Arief Emran Arifin allowed Mahfuz’s defamation suit and ordered Muhammad Sanusi to pay RM50,000 in damages to Mahfuz
            </p>

            <p>
                Mahfuz filed the suit on Oct 9, 2029, over a post made by Muhammad Sanusi on his Facebook account on July 30 the same year, linking Mahfuz as the Pokok Sena Member of Parliament to the matter of the transfer of a Sports Toto outlet to the area

                Although the Federal Court reached a split decision to reject the former prime minister’s application for review, Malaysian Bar president Karen Cheah said the majority ruling stood
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah also said in a statement that a Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigation on former High Court judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, who first decided Najib’s case, had no bearing as the agency was not the authority to oversee the judiciary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Investigations by the MACC in this regard are not only without jurisdiction, but also begs the question as to why MACC has traversed into areas that are not within the scope of the MACC Act 2009, nor within competence of the MACC,” Cheah said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah also said the sole dissenting judge in the Federal Court decision to reject Najib’s review application did not nullify the majority decision

            <p>
                Last week, the majority decision by four judges on the panel rejected Najib’s challenge against his conviction and jail sentence in the SRC case, and effectively endorsed the August 2022 decision of the Federal Court panel chaired by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat which had ordered Najib to begin serving his 12-year sentence

                A retirement home is a private facility that offers seniors care and support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you save for the care that you may eventually need in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For instance, the average cost of a private room in a nursing home in Hawaii is $14,113 per month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cost of retirement homes can indeed be high in some cases

            <p>
                Choosing the Right Retirement Home There's a lot to consider when choosing a retirement home

            <p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 2 — A Muslim-wear clothing boutique in Shah Alam, Selangor was ordered to close after some 500 people turned up to seize a purported ongoing bargain sale, with shoppers tussling with one another to purchase them at RM1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shah Alam police chief Assistant Commissioner Mohd Iqbal Ibrahim today said authorities were informed of a complaint around 10.30am yesterday, after a huge commotion took place at the clothing shop located in Section 7 of the Selangor state capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Iqbal said no reports have been lodged by either party over the incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No untoward incident took place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The public are advised not to be gullible with promotions during this festive period, whereas business owners must avoid organising any form of promotion that could mislead the public to prevent a repeat of today’s incident,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The clothing brand that specialises in ready-to-wear Muslim fashion had earlier today offered a limited number of early birds the chance to purchase items at heavily discounted prices

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 2 — A Muslim-wear clothing boutique in Shah Alam, Selangor was ordered to close after some 500 people turned up to seize a purported ongoing bargain sale, with shoppers tussling with one another to purchase them at RM1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shah Alam police chief Assistant Commissioner Mohd Iqbal Ibrahim today said authorities were informed of a complaint around 10.30am yesterday, after a huge commotion took place at the clothing shop located in Section 7 of the Selangor state capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Iqbal said no reports have been lodged by either party over the incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No untoward incident took place

            <p>
                The public are advised not to be gullible with promotions during this festive period, whereas business owners must avoid organising any form of promotion that could mislead the public to prevent a repeat of today’s incident,” he said

            <p>
                The clothing brand that specialises in ready-to-wear Muslim fashion had earlier today offered a limited number of early birds the chance to purchase items at heavily discounted prices

                Lingeshwaran was appointed as a Dewan Negara senator in March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "After the debate on Budget 2023 in the Dewan Negara on March 29, we managed to meet Health Ministry officials, where we touched on the longstanding issue of contract doctors being absorbed in the system as permanent staff,” said Dr Lingeshwaran
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We are well aware of the continuous engagement and persistent effort by the Health Minister and her team in negotiating with the Public Services Department on this issue,” he added, speaking about the planned doctors’ strike set for next week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Therefore in view of the situation I appeal to all doctors who have taken the Hippocratic Oath with me to hold off the three-day planned strike,” added Dr Lingeshwaran
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 'Mogok Doktor Malaysia' Instagram page recently claimed that more than 8,000 contract doctors would go on a job strike to protest 'unfair systems' and 'low wages'

            <p>
                By contrast, at Liverpool, while the situation with Klopp's squad has been at the other extreme at times this season, particularly in midfield, it has at least allowed the prodigiously talented Stefan Bajčetić to emerge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The situation at Liverpool this season has been far from perfect, of course, and this season, even if it ends with Champions League football being secured, will have been a disappointment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the joined-up thinking required to put that right is already in place, as Chelsea could suffer the unexpected consequences of a scattergun approach at the other end of the spectrum — allowing Liverpool and others to profit.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ansu's goal was sandwiched by two Lewandowski strikes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One fine cross at the end of the first half deserved a goal -- Lewandowski could not convert -- and he took his own goal really well in the second period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The goal is a consequence of his hard work and his talent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - This is Barcelona's fifth game scoring at least four goals in LaLiga this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcelona go into the match with a one-goal advantage as they aim to continue their objective of two trophies

                (Bloomberg) -- Lincoln Power LLC, the owner of two Illinois power plants, filed for bankruptcy after its financial strain was exacerbated by nearly $39 million in penalties levied by the biggest US electric-grid operator

                Tze Liang, whose highest achievement was winning gold in the men’s 3 metre (m) springboard at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, has thrown down the gauntlet to his compatriots to step up in a bid to create more bigger splashes in the pool
            </p>

                They have to win first,” he told reporters after taking home gold in the men’s 3m springboard at the 58th Malaysia Invitational Age Group (MIAG) Diving Championships here, today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the 29-year-old diver won’t be joining the 2023 SEA Games squad, he hoped that both Muhammad Syafiq Puteh and Gabriel Gilbert Daim will go all out so as to maintain their gold and silver medals respectively in the men’s 3m springboard event at the biennial games in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, next month

                Earlier, Tze Liang oozed class as he amassed 452.35 points to emerge as champion followed by another national diver Chew Yi Wei, who took silver with 407.10 points while Muhammad Syafiq had to settle for bronze with 402.70 points
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite unable to overcome Tze Liang in the men’s 3m springboard, Yi Wei still managed to take home gold for the national team, this time in the men’s synchronised 3m springboard with Gabriel after collecting 341.49 points

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another reason why the 2023 Mazda CX-30 is more fun to drive than the 2023 Toyota Corolla Cross is its more powerful engines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the Corolla Cross, the most powerful model is the hybrid variant, which produces 194 horsepower
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2023 CX-30 has some other strengths over the 2023 Corolla Cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the Corolla Cross, all-wheel drive is optional, so you have to pay extra
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2023 Mazda CX-30 is more fun to drive than the 2023 Toyota Cross, which gives it a big advantage

                It’s more fun to drive than the 2023 Toyota Corolla Cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another reason why the 2023 Mazda CX-30 is more fun to drive than the 2023 Toyota Corolla Cross is its more powerful engines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the Corolla Cross, the most powerful model is the hybrid variant, which produces 194 horsepower
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2023 CX-30 has some other strengths over the 2023 Corolla Cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the Corolla Cross, all-wheel drive is optional, so you have to pay extra
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2023 Mazda CX-30 is more fun to drive than the 2023 Toyota Cross, which gives it a big advantage

                The agreement came on the last day of a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors of Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) members, which was held in Indonesia's Bali island, with Indonesia being this year's Asean chair

                Governor of Bank Indonesia Perry Warjiyo said the organization would establish a task force to formulate the transition process to use Asean local currencies in financial transactions as a realization of Asean's current local currencies settlement cooperation framework

                In this handout photo provided by the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), PCG personnel walk beside the MV Lady Mary Joy that caught fire in Basilan, southern Philippines early Thursday, March 30, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More than a dozen people died while other were reported missing after an inter-island cargo and passenger ferry with about 200 passengers and crew onboard caught fire close to midnight in the southern Philippines, a provincial governor said Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When a team of coast guard personnel, including Bureau of Fire officers, boarded the burned ferry on Baluk-baluk island's coast, they discovered the bodies of 18 passengers scattered on the uppermost open-air economy deck and another floor below, coast guard Commander Chadley Salahuddin said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The steel-hulled ferry could accommodate up to 430 people and was not overcrowded, said another coast guard official, Commodore Rejard Marfe

            <p>
                Threats posed by Muslim insurgents, including those aligned with the Islamic State group, remain a security issue in the southern Philippines, where cargo and passenger ships are provided extra security by the coast guard and other law enforcement agencies in vulnerable regions

Meanwhile, Hua said Xi also met Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a separate meet where the Chinese President told Lee that the "Asian region has blazed a development path featuring independence, mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, openness, inclusion and win-win cooperation with Asian characteristics." "In a world with fast-evolving major changes unseen in a century, we need to value and defend the hard-won development momentum, firmly reject hegemony and bullying, and not allow any country to deprive Asian people of the right to pursue a better life," Xi told Lee

                Here’s how to make a six-figure income and pay no income taxes on it – all legally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tack on another $27,700 in income that is tax-free from a standard deduction, and you can escape income tax on at least $116,950
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By way of the deduction, all taxpayers get the first portion of their income tax-free
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard deduction can reduce any kind of income, such as investment income or earned income (money from a job)

                Liverpool's clash with Manchester City is the first of a tough three-game run of fixtures in the Premier League, so we simulated the game to see how Klopp's side could fare

                City lost the ball to Trent Alexander-Arnold deep in the Liverpool half, and the defender exposed City's high line with a long ball forward for Mohamed Salah to chase

                Hence, his reputation is rising quickly and United will need to move fast to secure his services ahead of their European rivals in the next transfer window

            <p>
                However, this could well be the last chance for him to get a sizeable fee for Fabinho, who has shown real signs of decline this season, and secure a long-term replacement off the back of his sale

            </p>
            
            <p>
                One possible dilemma Klopp should be facing ahead of the upcoming transfer window is whether to cash in on midfield anchor Fabinho who has had an indifferent season in terms of form

            <p>
                However, this could well be the last chance for him to get a sizeable fee for Fabinho, who has shown real signs of decline this season, and secure a long-term replacement off the back of his sale

                Summer signing Antony became the club's second most-expensive signing when he moved from Ajax, but he too is not fancied by the former United man

                Wrexham hit 100 points in the National League on Saturday as they strengthened their bid for promotion to the English Football League in their second full season under the ownership of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney

                The standard was up there with any training we've had since I've been here and that's always a great sign for a manager and assistant manager." Wrexham have now played 20 home matches this season, winning 19 and drawing one

                Wrexham hit 100 points in the National League on Saturday as they strengthened their bid for promotion to the English Football League in their second full season under the ownership of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Welsh club beat former Premier League side Oldham Athletic 5-1 to take their point tally to triple digits and stay ahead in the title race with Notts County just three points behind them in second place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They have the joint-second tightest defence in the league with 36 goals conceded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard was up there with any training we've had since I've been here and that's always a great sign for a manager and assistant manager." Wrexham have now played 20 home matches this season, winning 19 and drawing one

            <p>
                Fellow National League high-flyers Notts County also look set to hit a century of points

            <p>
                In Malaysia, it will cost RM4,500 per month for verification, and another RM230 per month if you want an affiliate (like a subsidiary brand, a leader, a spokesperson or an employee) vetted as well

                About Us Advertise VATICAN CITY, April 1 — Pope Francis’s unexpected hospitalisation this week raised fresh questions over his future, providing fuel for critics hungry for a new head of the Catholic Church, experts say

                In October 2015, when the pope was pushing the Church to be more forgiving to remarried divorcees, enraging traditionalists, the Vatican had to deny rumours Francis had a brain tumour

            <p>
                He said Francis deliberately keeps information to himself, “because he knows that this old Vatican machinery tends to run itself, and run the pope, and he doesn’t want that”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the lack of transparency also means conjecture as to how long Francis has left

            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Francis deliberately keeps information to himself, “because he knows that this old Vatican machinery tends to run itself, and run the pope, and he doesn’t want that”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the lack of transparency also means conjecture as to how long Francis has left

                Deputy Health Minister Lukanisman Awang Sauni said the initiative would require amendments to be made to the Pensions Act 1990 and discussions were still being held with the Public Service Department (JPA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the ministry was examining the proposal in a comprehensive manner as it also involved medical staff in the pharmacy and dental sectors, in addition to solving the shortage of medical personnel such as nurses and physiotherapists

            <p>
                Yesterday (March 30), Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa told the Dewan Rakyat that efforts to absorb contract medical personnel into permanent service without pension benefits were being made to tackle the problem of work overload and ease the burden of the pension scheme which cost the country RM29.1bil in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, she said permanent staff on the EPF scheme would still be entitled to other benefits enjoyed by pensionable personnel, such as housing loans through the Public Sector Home Financing Board

                Deputy Health Minister Lukanisman Awang Sauni said the initiative would require amendments to be made to the Pensions Act 1990 and discussions were still being held with the Public Service Department (JPA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the ministry was examining the proposal in a comprehensive manner as it also involved medical staff in the pharmacy and dental sectors, in addition to solving the shortage of medical personnel such as nurses and physiotherapists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday (March 30), Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa told the Dewan Rakyat that efforts to absorb contract medical personnel into permanent service without pension benefits were being made to tackle the problem of work overload and ease the burden of the pension scheme which cost the country RM29.1bil in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, she said permanent staff on the EPF scheme would still be entitled to other benefits enjoyed by pensionable personnel, such as housing loans through the Public Sector Home Financing Board

                While Ahmad’s Zahid management of UMNO is an internal party matter, the appointments to state agencies run counter to pledges the Pakatan Harapan (PH)-led coalition government made during the November polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid's actions have not only become a lightning rod for the opposition leaders, who are accusing Mr Anwar of backsliding on his election promises to bring about reforms in return for ensuring UMNO’s continued support for the coalition government.  They are also fuelling unease among senior PH leaders, who have long been wary about Mr Anwar’s move to strike a partnership with Ahmad Zahid and UMNO, sources told CNA.  “Making a deal with (Ahmad) Zahid and UMNO was always going to be problematic and that is now playing out,” said a senior PH minister, who also added that the issues over the appointments were being unfairly amplified because Ahmad Zahid was exercising his authority as minister over appointments involving agencies under his ministry.  “The problem with UMNO is that it believes it is business as usual even as a minority partner (in government) and Anwar’s challenge is to make sure that he draws the line when it comes to GLCs,” said the PH politician

            <p>
                The current uneasiness over how Ahmad Zahid has positioned his allies in government agencies reflects the messy state of Malaysia’s coalition politics following the 15th General Election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stakes are high for both Anwar and Ahmad Zahid on how the ruling coalition performs in the Malay-belt states
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Should UMNO show no improvement in the support from the Malays, the outcome would be considered a rejection of UMNO and Ahmad Zahid, who is battling corruption charges in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister, too, will have to account to his supporters for being too accommodating to UMNO.

                A case management of the appeal was conducted today (March 31) before Court of Appeal deputy registrar Dr Syahliza Warnoh
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid's lawyers had submitted a representation in January this year asking the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) to consider discontinuing the prosecution's appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal on Sept 26 last year against the Shah Alam High Court's decision to acquit and discharge Ahmad Zahid, who is now deputy prime minister, of all the charges after ruling that the prosecution had not made out a prima facie case against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the charge sheet, Ahmad Zahid was alleged to have committed those offences at Seri Satria, Precinct 16, Putrajaya and Country Heights, Kajang, between October 2014 and March 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid was charged with allegedly committing the offences at a house in Country Heights, Kajang, between June 2015 and October 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its petition of appeal filed on Dec 29 last year, the prosecution submitted 14 reasons focusing on the findings of fact and law made by the High Court judge on the question of whether there was bribery in the giving and receiving of money in the case

                The prosecution filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal on Sept 26 last year against the Shah Alam High Court's decision to acquit and discharge Ahmad Zahid, who is now deputy prime minister, of all the charges after ruling that the prosecution had not made out a prima facie case against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the charge sheet, Ahmad Zahid was alleged to have committed those offences at Seri Satria, Precinct 16, Putrajaya and Country Heights, Kajang, between October 2014 and March 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid was charged with allegedly committing the offences at a house in Country Heights, Kajang, between June 2015 and October 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its petition of appeal filed on Dec 29 last year, the prosecution submitted 14 reasons focusing on the findings of fact and law made by the High Court judge on the question of whether there was bribery in the giving and receiving of money in the case

                Gerawat was replying to Sarawak Timber Association (STA) chairman Dato Henry Lau’s call to the state government to expedite the entry process of foreign workers from source countries other than Indonesia for the timber industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the timber industry, 250 APs have been approved in 2022 and only 24 were utilised, leaving a balance of 226 unutilised APs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that from January to March this year, 280 APs were approved for the timber industry, all of which have yet to be utilised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On STA’s complaint that the time taken to get approval was too long, Gerawat said his ministry had organised a review of the internal processes for hiring of foreign general workers which was jointly conducted by the state’s Department of Labour, Immigration Department, and the Immigration and Labour Management Unit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To further improve this process, Gerawat said the state cabinet had also approved his ministry’s proposal for the engagement of a vendor to develop an end to end digital platform to digitise all the components relating to the processing of foreign workers application

                Gerawat was replying to Sarawak Timber Association (STA) chairman Dato Henry Lau’s call to the state government to expedite the entry process of foreign workers from source countries other than Indonesia for the timber industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the timber industry, 250 APs have been approved in 2022 and only 24 were utilised, leaving a balance of 226 unutilised APs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that from January to March this year, 280 APs were approved for the timber industry, all of which have yet to be utilised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On STA’s complaint that the time taken to get approval was too long, Gerawat said his ministry had organised a review of the internal processes for hiring of foreign general workers which was jointly conducted by the state’s Department of Labour, Immigration Department, and the Immigration and Labour Management Unit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To further improve this process, Gerawat said the state cabinet had also approved his ministry’s proposal for the engagement of a vendor to develop an end to end digital platform to digitise all the components relating to the processing of foreign workers application

                Apart from the lack of permanent posts, there are many other issues that are causing frustration among the public health care workforce which the government should focus on resolving now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We understand that securing permanent positions will require a significant, long term financial commitment from the government but for now, the government can go ahead with the more easily attainable measures
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All the issues along with solutions have been brought up during our townhall session with the Health Minister and we await the ministry's response
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We hope the Prime Minister had been briefed on the issues and the many solutions that the MMA had proposed during the townhall with the Health Ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MMA had in fact written to the Prime Minister's office to meet with him and brief him first hand on the issues but was referred to the Health Minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We appreciate having met with the Health Minister on a number of occasions however it is important that the Prime Minister as the leader of the nation be made aware of the magnitude of the issues in our public health care system and its far-reaching impact on the delivery of health care for the population

            <p>
                Apart from the lack of permanent posts, there are many other issues that are causing frustration among the public health care workforce which the government should focus on resolving now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We understand that securing permanent positions will require a significant, long term financial commitment from the government but for now, the government can go ahead with the more easily attainable measures
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All the issues along with solutions have been brought up during our townhall session with the Health Minister and we await the ministry's response
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We hope the Prime Minister had been briefed on the issues and the many solutions that the MMA had proposed during the townhall with the Health Ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MMA had in fact written to the Prime Minister's office to meet with him and brief him first hand on the issues but was referred to the Health Minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We appreciate having met with the Health Minister on a number of occasions however it is important that the Prime Minister as the leader of the nation be made aware of the magnitude of the issues in our public health care system and its far-reaching impact on the delivery of health care for the population

                According to Football Insider, Erik ten Hag’s side may well be the main rival to Liverpool on that front

                A YOUNG man was exposed abusing stray dogs brutally outside a veterinary clinic located in Johor Bahru

            <p>
                On Mar 8, he cycled to the veterinary clinic where the stray dog resides and roughly threw a bucket at one of the dogs a few times until it ran away and he went after the dog

                On March 14, he returned to the veterinary clinic to fling bricks and stones at the poor dogs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Mar 27, the perpetrator took a metal rod to beat the dog and drove away for a bit and eventually returned to the scene and set one of them on fire

            <p>
                The animal clinic’s veterinarian had broke down in tears hearing about the abuse and attested that the maimed dog was friendly to their clients and never displayed any signs of aggression towards other people, let alone chased them

                "We refer to the social media posts by the #MOGOKDOKTORKONTRAK group telling Malaysians not to go to public health care facilities from April 3 to 5 because of a planned strike by this group of contract doctors," he said

                BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said the cross-border QR code payment linkage is a "significant step forward in realising the vision of an Asean network of fast, efficient, and interconnected retail payment systems.” "The QR linkage between Malaysia and Singapore will benefit millions of commuters across the Causeway as well as business and leisure travelers

                The accusations were made at the start of a trial that prosecutor Nicole Lockhart said will link Michel to Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low, who is suspected of embezzling US$4.5 billion (RM19.84 billion) from 1MDB, and a Chinese government influence campaign aimed at repatriating dissident Guo Wengui

                The accusations were made at the start of a trial that prosecutor Nicole Lockhart said will link Michel to Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low, who is suspected of embezzling US$4.5 billion (RM19.84 billion) from 1MDB, and a Chinese government influence campaign aimed at repatriating dissident Guo Wengui
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Michel has denied the allegations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the first alleged scheme, prosecutors said Michel agreed to funnel about US$2 million from Low into Obama's 2012 re-election campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In exchange for helping Low, the government said Michel pocketed US$18 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For his work on these two lobbying campaigns on behalf of Low and China, prosecutors said Michel was paid US$70 million

                Retirement Income From $2.5 Million A retirement nest egg of $2.5 million can likely produce an annual income of $100,000 for as long as you are likely to live
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if inflation runs at the 2% rate that is the target of federal policymakers, the retiree will withdraw $100,000 the first year of retirement, $102,000 the second year, $104,040 the third year and so on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This would permit a 65-year-old retiree to maintain consistent purchasing power until age 95 and beyond

                They may have once missed out on Ferguson, just like they once missed out on Mbappé, but right now, while the 18-year-old remains at Brighton, Liverpool still has a chance to sign him

                As Mbappé has shown, though, the longer you wait, the more tricky a transfer can become, so Liverpool cannot afford to dither forever

                FOREIGN submarines must seek permission from Malaysian authorities should they want to sail submerged while in the country’s waters, says Defence Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad said the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) is clear on this issue, requiring any submarine passing through the territory of another nation to be on the surface
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If a foreign submarine, whether conventional or nuclear powered, wants to sail submerged underwater in our waters, permission must be sought from the Royal Malaysian Navy,” the Defence Minister said when answering a question raised by Lim Guan Eng (PH-Bagan)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim had asked about Malaysia’s stand on the recent A$368bil (RM1.08 trillion) deal by Australia to purchase eight submarines under the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (Aukus) enhanced security partnership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This was followed by a call from the United States Secretary of Defence and a meeting with the minister of state at the Ministry of Defence, the United Kingdom, on March 28,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad said during the discussions, he made it clear that Malaysia’s position on Aukus remains

                Premier League • England A Man Utd attacker has sent a message to Erik ten Hag over his minutes, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed two deals for the same player could soon be sanctioned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His first start for the club came on March 16 as Man Utd saw off Real Betis in the Europa League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, speaking to ESPN during the recent international break, Pellistri revealed his hunger to earn more minutes under Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Romano claimed another loan move could be sanctioned this summer, though only if he signs a new deal first
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “What’s going on right now is that for Pellistri, Man Utd are prepared to offer him a new contract and then decide if they want to send him on loan next season or keep him in the squad,” said Romano
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is something that, of course, has to be decided with Ten Hag.” Romano added Pellistri had loan proposals in January from “Bologna and Sassuolo in Italy, some Spanish clubs but also Flamengo in Brazil.” Ten Hag refused to greenlight a mid-season exit, though the story may be different six months later

                Ten Hag was asked about Shaw's contract at his weekly news conference on Friday, ahead of Sunday's trip to Newcastle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We definitely want to keep him because he's a really important player for our team." Shaw's is the first of a number of contract renewals United hope to sort out before the end of the year

                Dalot has a contract until 2024 while De Gea's contract will expire in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I've good hope," Ten Hag said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I have a good hope he will be available."

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, March 31 — A disruption at automated immigration clearance counters Friday led to rare delays at Singapore’s Changi airport, affecting hundreds of travellers

            <p>
                There were also “super long” lines at the airport’s Terminal 1 but manual counters were clearing them up fast, another traveller said
            </p>

                First Citizens Bank picked up assets from collapsed Silicon Valley Bank at a deep discount, a deal negotiated in part by a billionaire family well-versed in buying failed banks.  Forbes looked at the Holding Family, the North Carolina banking dynasty behind First Citizens BancShares, which saw an opportunity to expand its banking empire after this month's implosion of SVB.  First Citizen's growth has accelerated in part through the purchases of more than 20 failed small banks since the 2008 global financial crisis, the report said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cumulative stake was worth $2.7 billion after a 54% stock price surge Monday following the SVB deal.  First Citizens with the SVB transaction is moving into the ranks of the largest 20 banks in the US, with $219 billion in assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its purchases of failed banks include First Regional Bank and Temecula Valley Bank in California and Denver-based United Western Bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its assets jumped from $109 billion just before the SVB deal and have increased from $16.7 billion at the end of 2008.  Before the SVB agreement, First Citizens' largest deal was the $2.2 billion buyout of bankrupt CIT Group in January 2022.  Under terms of the SVB deal, First Citizens, for a $16.5 billion discount, is taking over $119 billion in deposits and $72 billion worth of the failed bank's loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The FDIC will hold onto about $90 billion worth of securities and other assets.  First Citizens, founded in 1898, got underway as Bank of Smithfield and focused on farmers in Johnston County, North Carolina, Forbes stated

            <p>
                The cumulative stake was worth $2.7 billion after a 54% stock price surge Monday following the SVB deal.  First Citizens with the SVB transaction is moving into the ranks of the largest 20 banks in the US, with $219 billion in assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its purchases of failed banks include First Regional Bank and Temecula Valley Bank in California and Denver-based United Western Bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its assets jumped from $109 billion just before the SVB deal and have increased from $16.7 billion at the end of 2008.  Before the SVB agreement, First Citizens' largest deal was the $2.2 billion buyout of bankrupt CIT Group in January 2022.  Under terms of the SVB deal, First Citizens, for a $16.5 billion discount, is taking over $119 billion in deposits and $72 billion worth of the failed bank's loans

            <p>
                The FDIC will hold onto about $90 billion worth of securities and other assets.  First Citizens, founded in 1898, got underway as Bank of Smithfield and focused on farmers in Johnston County, North Carolina, Forbes stated
