                Some 6.7 million members or 51.5 percent of 13.1 million EPF members, have savings of less than RM10,000

                The flat front end, small and boring wheels across the range, understyled rear end make it perhaps Perodua’s most love-it-or-hate-it design yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Missing in the latest range is an SUV-inspired Axia Style variant, which was available in the previous 2019 update for the first-gen Axia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It doesn’t take much
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The changes have a significant effect on the overall appearance of the Axia – the front immediately looks more menacing, while the rear even looks fairly fashionable now
            </p>

                Perhaps Perodua is saving the Style for an upcoming mid-life update, or maybe not at all if it has deemed the outgoing Axia Style a sales failure

                The flat front end, small and boring wheels across the range, understyled rear end make it perhaps Perodua’s most love-it-or-hate-it design yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Missing in the latest range is an SUV-inspired Axia Style variant, which was available in the previous 2019 update for the first-gen Axia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It doesn’t take much
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The changes have a significant effect on the overall appearance of the Axia – the front immediately looks more menacing, while the rear even looks fairly fashionable now
            </p>

                at Breaking News | Business | News  DAIRY products provider Farm Fresh Bhd plans to acquire a 65% stake in the local ice cream chain The Inside Scoop for RM83.9 million

                FFB said the proposals will pave the way for the group’s entry and ownership in one of the fastest growing artisanal ice creameries and the largest home-grown ice-cream chain in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between the financial years 2017 to 2021, the filing said TISSB group’s revenue grew from RM10 million to RM36.3 million, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Post completion of the proposals, FFB said Edmund Tan and Lim will drive TISSB’s existing ice cream business, which will form part of the FFB Group’s ice cream division
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FFB said the group’s diversification into the artisan ice cream chain business would serve as an opportunity to mitigate its concentration risk on its core business of rearing dairy cows and the production and marketing and sale of dairy milk products

                Sara Khadem of Iran sits in front of a chess board

            <p>
                But 25-year-old Sarasadat Khademalsharieh, better known as Sara Khadem, also told Reuters that the warrant, which made her return to Iran impossible, was "the most horrible thing" that happened to her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said that, after playing in December's FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in Kazakhstan's Almaty without the headscarf mandatory under Iran's strict Islamic dress code, she had hardly expected harsher reprisals than a travel ban

                "But it (no hijab) has become one of the symbols of the movement in Iran and I also decided to finally do something that I wanted to, to be myself...I was motivated by the people of Iran." Laws enforcing mandatory hijab-wearing have become a flashpoint during the unrest that has swept Iran since mid-September when a 22-year-old Iranian-Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, died in the custody of the morality police
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There are lots of things that people are not happy about at the moment, so even if this time it doesn't change anything, I think there will come a time when people will rise up again," said Khadem, who does not consider herself a political activist, but wants to be a voice for change
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ranked 774th in the world and 9th in Iran, Khadem plans to keep playing under the Iranian flag, but has received proposals from other countries

                Sara Khadem of Iran sits in front of a chess board
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But 25-year-old Sarasadat Khademalsharieh, better known as Sara Khadem, also told Reuters that the warrant, which made her return to Iran impossible, was "the most horrible thing" that happened to her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said that, after playing in December's FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in Kazakhstan's Almaty without the headscarf mandatory under Iran's strict Islamic dress code, she had hardly expected harsher reprisals than a travel ban
            </p>

                "But it (no hijab) has become one of the symbols of the movement in Iran and I also decided to finally do something that I wanted to, to be myself...I was motivated by the people of Iran." Laws enforcing mandatory hijab-wearing have become a flashpoint during the unrest that has swept Iran since mid-September when a 22-year-old Iranian-Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, died in the custody of the morality police
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There are lots of things that people are not happy about at the moment, so even if this time it doesn't change anything, I think there will come a time when people will rise up again," said Khadem, who does not consider herself a political activist, but wants to be a voice for change
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ranked 774th in the world and 9th in Iran, Khadem plans to keep playing under the Iranian flag, but has received proposals from other countries

                Now is not a good time to be working in Britain’s car industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it is the announcement of several thousand job losses at Ford that will send the biggest shockwaves through the global car sector – 3,800 in total, 2,300 of which will come in Germany, 1,300 in the UK, and the remaining 200 across the rest of Europe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the central premises of net zero is that the resulting job destruction in old industries such as car-making, but also oil and gas exploration, construction and farming, will be more than offset by the job creation in green industries such as renewable energy – but if the remarks of Ford Germany’s boss Martin Sander are anything to go by, that looks doubtful at best
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are moving into a world with less [sic] global platforms where less engineering work is necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is why we have to make the adjustments.” Ford’s intervention is particularly significant because it is possible to extrapolate from the latest round of job cuts and arrive at an approximate figure for the industry as a whole as it goes electric
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But having been a late adopter, Ford is now among those leading the charge with a pledge to boost spending on electric vehicles to $50bn (£41bn), from $30bn previously, by 2026 and run its electric car unit separately from its legacy combustion engine operations, in a move aimed at catching trailblazer Tesla

                With more electric vehicles entering the Malaysian market, Nissan is expected to bring in more EV options such as the Nissan Ariya
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As shown above, Nissan’s next EV for Malaysia is the 2023 Nissan Leaf
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is essentially a refresh of their 2nd generation Leaf which was launched in Malaysia back in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current Nissan Leaf that’s sold in Malaysia with a 148hp motor and 40kWh battery is now priced at RM175,800 after tax exemptions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We hope ETCM will bring the Ariya, Nissan’s latest and greatest EV to Malaysia very soon

                “It would be better (if) our economic growth exceeds 5% within two- to three years; the aspiration of reaching high-income country status will be sooner,” he said at a press conference on Malaysia’s economic performance and gross domestic product (GDP) growth 2022 here on Wednesday (Feb 15)

            <p>
                While the early game was fairly even between both teams, the mid-game saw Blacklist Rivalry suffer terribly as Talon Esports amassed a sizable networth & experience lead

            <p>

                While Blacklist Rivalry was looking for revenge after Talon Esports denied it the opportunity to go to the Major itself in a tiebreaker, Talon Esports once again managed to take down Blacklist Rivalry

                While the early game was fairly even between both teams, the mid-game saw Blacklist Rivalry suffer terribly as Talon Esports amassed a sizable networth & experience lead

                CIJ executive director Wathshlah Naidu made the call in response to the Malaysian government’s decision not to charge human rights activist Heidy Quah under Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This decision, we hope, foretells the government’s commitment in not weaponising repressive laws to silence critics and curtail our freedom of expression and speech

            <p>
                Human rights activists, such as Heidy Quah, should not have been investigated and intimidated for speaking out and critiquing government action,” she said

            <p>
                On April 25 last year, the Sessions Court agreed with Quah’s preliminary objection against the charge which was said to be defective, and granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The DNAA meant Quah was released from the charge but the prosecution can still decide to pursue the case against her in the future

                Manchester United won’t bill Abraham as a ‘back-up’ to Osimhen, but it’s not a bad way of putting it." Previous reports have also claimed Abraham is on United's radar, but the star has been linked to Arsenal.

            <p>

                MANCHESTER UNITED have "genuine interest" in Tammy Abraham if they cannot land Victor Osimhen, reports claim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We know Manchester United love Napoli’s Victor Osimhen, as in fact do Chelsea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United won’t bill Abraham as a ‘back-up’ to Osimhen, but it’s not a bad way of putting it." Previous reports have also claimed Abraham is on United's radar, but the star has been linked to Arsenal.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But he has so far struggled to shine even with United's winning form in 2023

                "My son's left foot was run over by a bus and I immediately rushed him to the TJH for treatment the same evening
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The woman said on Feb 7, she had to rush her son to the TJH emergency department as he had been running a high fever for days and his condition was deteriorating
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                She went on to say that if the doctors had been diligent from the start, her son would not have to undergo such a traumatic and painful experience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The mother also claimed that her son would have to take blood-thinning medicine for the next three months due to complications over the past few days

                Justice Hanipah, who delivered the court's unanimous decision, said it was the court's view there was no specific meaning to the term "trafficking" in the Anti-Trafficking In Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 (ATIPSOM) and the court referred to a Cambridge dictionary to get the meaning of the term "trafficking"

                On April 4, 2019, the Sessions Court found Lee guilty of the offence and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment

            <p>
                Cheah, 83, died in her sleep at about 11am on Sunday (Feb 12)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid spent about 20mins at the deceased residence in Taman Desa Bersatu, Hutan Melintang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On his arrival at about 12.40pm on Wednesday (Feb 15), Ahmad Zahid was seen comforting Cheah’s son and his close friend Beh Song Wan, 60, or 'Bujang'

            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said he cherished the relationship with the family, adding that Malaysians must have mutual respect regardless of religion, race and culture to maintain harmony

                Cheah, 83, died in her sleep at about 11am on Sunday (Feb 12)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid spent about 20mins at the deceased residence in Taman Desa Bersatu, Hutan Melintang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On his arrival at about 12.40pm on Wednesday (Feb 15), Ahmad Zahid was seen comforting Cheah’s son and his close friend Beh Song Wan, 60, or 'Bujang'
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said he cherished the relationship with the family, adding that Malaysians must have mutual respect regardless of religion, race and culture to maintain harmony

                Sturgeon became leader of the Scottish National Party in the wake of a 2014 independence referendum when Scotland voted 55% to 45% to remain part of the United Kingdom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a surprise announcement, she said she would stand down as first minister and leader of the SNP once a successor was found
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sturgeon told a news conference in Edinburgh that while she believed there was majority backing for independence in Scotland, the SNP needed to solidify and grow that support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the SNP suffered a blow in November when the United Kingdom's top court ruled that her government could not hold a second referendum without approval from the British parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Her departure will have implications for the SNP, for the fight for independence and for the drive by Britain's opposition Labour Party to win enough seats in the United Kingdom to beat Sunak's Conservatives in an election expected next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Possible candidates to replace Sturgeon include Kate Forbes, the 32-year-old cabinet secretary for finance who was first elected as a lawmaker in 2016, and John Swinney, a 58-year-old deputy first minister

                Sturgeon became leader of the Scottish National Party in the wake of a 2014 independence referendum when Scotland voted 55% to 45% to remain part of the United Kingdom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a surprise announcement, she said she would stand down as first minister and leader of the SNP once a successor was found
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sturgeon told a news conference in Edinburgh that while she believed there was majority backing for independence in Scotland, the SNP needed to solidify and grow that support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the SNP suffered a blow in November when the United Kingdom's top court ruled that her government could not hold a second referendum without approval from the British parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Her departure will have implications for the SNP, for the fight for independence and for the drive by Britain's opposition Labour Party to win enough seats in the United Kingdom to beat Sunak's Conservatives in an election expected next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Possible candidates to replace Sturgeon include Kate Forbes, the 32-year-old cabinet secretary for finance who was first elected as a lawmaker in 2016, and John Swinney, a 58-year-old deputy first minister

                In the court's decision, Justice Hanipah said the High Court judge was duty-bound to consider all evidence before him but in this case, he failed to comply with Section 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code for not considering the defence case which amounted to a miscarriage of justice

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Feb 15 — Nurul Izzah Anwar would “add value” to the special advisory panel to the finance minister, her father Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli said today amid fresh allegations of nepotism levelled at the new government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, who is also the prime minister, was again accused of nepotism after Nurul Izzah was invited to join the secretariat of the advisory panel, after giving up her previous role as a senior adviser to him on economics and finance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked if her spot on the advisory panel would still constitute nepotism, Rafizi said Nurul Izzah could help the secretariat “precipitate” with decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think there is added value (to Nurul Izzah sitting in the panel),” the minister said at a press conference here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                so there is added value (to Nurul Izzah’s involvement),” the minister added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Allegations of nepotism arose after Nurul Izzah disclosed that she had been appointed as a senior advisor of economics and finance to her father

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Feb 15 — Nurul Izzah Anwar would “add value” to the special advisory panel to the finance minister, her father Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli said today amid fresh allegations of nepotism levelled at the new government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, who is also the prime minister, was again accused of nepotism after Nurul Izzah was invited to join the secretariat of the advisory panel, after giving up her previous role as a senior adviser to him on economics and finance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked if her spot on the advisory panel would still constitute nepotism, Rafizi said Nurul Izzah could help the secretariat “precipitate” with decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think there is added value (to Nurul Izzah sitting in the panel),” the minister said at a press conference here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                so there is added value (to Nurul Izzah’s involvement),” the minister added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Allegations of nepotism arose after Nurul Izzah disclosed that she had been appointed as a senior advisor of economics and finance to her father

            </p>
            
            <p>
                "According to data obtained by the Health Informatics Centre (PIK) of the ministry’s Planning Division, we see a trend of an increasing number of patients in the Emergency and Trauma Department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides this, the ministry has also empowered Lean Healthcare initiatives which aim to reduce waiting time to see a doctor, right from the registration counter until the patient collects medicine at the pharmacy, as well as the waiting time for ward beds for those being admitted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "An example of this is at the HTAR Emergency Department (Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital) where we have seen Lean Healthcare being able to reduce patient waiting time from 192 minutes to only 88 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although this waiting time is a bit long, on average we were able to reduce it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another initiative involves the implementation of a Bed Management Unit (BMU) at the hospital level, which is responsible for bed management and centralised patient flow, involving either emergency or elective patients from the process of admission, discharge and internal and inter-facility transfer.- Bernama

                A man, identified as Philip Mehrtens, the New Zealand pilot who is said to be held hostage by a pro-independence group, stands among the separatist fighters in Indonesia's Papua region, in this undated picture released on February 14, 2023

            <p>
                The pilot, Philip Mehrtens, who flew a plane operated by airline Susi Air, was abducted by fighters from the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) last week after landing in the remote region of Nduga

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 15 — The trial of Lim Guan Eng for the Penang undersea tunnel project at the Sessions Court here has been suspended today so that the defence can get notes from a separate court proceeding that could exonerate the former chief minister of purportedly receiving RM2 million in bribes

            <p>
                Khairy and the other DJs talked about various topics including his post-election life last year, with him sharing that he felt "jammed" as he didn't know what to do and constantly thought about his future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On his reason for taking on the new job, Khairy said he had to wait for three years before getting his government pension and so accepted the offer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Apparently, I have to wait until I reach the age of 50 before I can get a pension
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the segment, several listeners also had the chance to chat with Khairy.

            <p>
                His son-in-law hired Hidayah through an agency in February 2022, and the younger man also gave her a mobile phone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hidayah was bathing the elderly man in a Punggol flat at around 10.30am on April 18, 2022, when she received a call from her husband, asking her what she was doing at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also took back the mobile phone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also checked the WhatsApp chats, and discovered that she had sent the picture to her husband and her sister-in-law

                This is a big match for United if they are to continue in the Europa League this season with the winner of this play off round reaching the last 16 in the competition

                Dalot could feature for United, should he be needed in the right-back role to add something for United, should that be required

                Casemiro is back for United have sat out of both matches against Leeds United due to suspension but he will not be available for Sunday’s clash with Leicester City at Old Trafford in the Premier League with that match to be his final match in his suspension

                Hameediyah Restaurant manager Muhammad Salim Ahamed Seeni Pakir said it wanted to make its nasi kandar available primarily to the B40 community and hoped other consumers would act responsibly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We hope our customers will have empathy and know that this initiative is for the poor and needy,” he said, adding that the restaurant would not have a mechanism to stop anyone from buying its Menu Rahmah selections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Salim said this after the launch of Menu Rahmah at the restaurant, well known for its nasi kandar since its inception in 1907
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Menu Rahmah will be available at Hameediyah Restaurant outlets in Sungai Ara and Campbell Street starting from next month

                PSG, who have now lost five games in all competitions in 2023, held firm in the opening half but were eventually subdued and failed to fight back despite finishing the game with Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi all on the pitch

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Christophe Galtier's side now face the prospect of a second elimination in a row in the last 16 on March 8 in Munich, although Mbappe's high-octane display as a second-half substitute will have given them hope

                It's an important victory but there's a second leg coming,” Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Conceding that goal before Kylian came on was a pity but they deserved to score.” Mbappe back from injury The stadium came to the boil when Mbappe replaced Carlos Soler, raising hopes that the France forward would bail out PSG on his comeback from a two-week injury layoff

            <p>
                PSG took the first punches but threatened on the break in an intense, yet uneventful, first half, and simply waited for some Neymar or Messi magic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They held on, despite losing Pavard to a red card in stoppage time, to hand PSG their first defeat in the competition this season

                It is true that the sight of Liverpool, having rode their luck in their own box just moments before, surging forward on the counter-attack for their first goal last night brought back memories of 2017-18 when Jürgen Klopp first unleashed his famous front three of Sadio Mane, Firmino and Salah

                Of course, Gakpo showed signs last night that he can operate in a false nine role akin to what Firmino has for Liverpool but, given Klopp’s desire for his players to be comfortable in a variety of positions, this tweak to the Dutchman’s role doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility

            <p>
                With the spotlight having been on Liverpool's midfield during a dismal January, perhaps Gakpo's performance last night offers a glimmer of hope that solutions can be found within the squad for the time being

                Dutch forward Cody Gakpo impressed while leading the line as he scored his first goal for Liverpool in the 2-0 win over Merseyside rivals Everton on Monday

                It is true that the sight of Liverpool, having rode their luck in their own box just moments before, surging forward on the counter-attack for their first goal last night brought back memories of 2017-18 when Jürgen Klopp first unleashed his famous front three of Sadio Mane, Firmino and Salah

                Of course, Gakpo showed signs last night that he can operate in a false nine role akin to what Firmino has for Liverpool but, given Klopp’s desire for his players to be comfortable in a variety of positions, this tweak to the Dutchman’s role doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility

            <p>
                With the spotlight having been on Liverpool's midfield during a dismal January, perhaps Gakpo's performance last night offers a glimmer of hope that solutions can be found within the squad for the time being

            <p>

                “He’s not only 19; he is one of our leaders and he became a leader in the last two and a half years.” According to The Mirror, Dortmund value Bellingham at around £130m

                Gabrielle, which reached New Zealand on Sunday before making its way down the east coast of the North Island, cut off a number of towns, closed roads and left houses under water

                "As New Zealand wakes this morning, there's parts of the country who are really still in the middle of the effects," said Kerry Gregory, chief executive of Fire and Emergency New Zealand on Wednesday

                The worst of the weather has now cleared and meteorological service WeatherWatch said in a statement that Cyclone Gabrielle is now east of the country and continuing to track away from the North Island with weather now improving
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, rivers in Hawke's Bay, a region on the eastern coast of the North Island, continue to pose risks and the local emergency management ordered further evacuations early on Wednesday

            <p>
                According to the service’s FAQ document, the first withdrawal from the service must be at least RM1,000 while subsequent withdrawals have to be in multiples of RM100

            <p>
                Customers also should take note of other costs that are associated with this service including the stamping fee which is 0.5% of the loan amount, and the RM5 attestation fee for each loan withdrawal
            </p>

                Through SLoan, Shopee Malaysia customers are able to obtain cash loans within 24 hours
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the service’s FAQ document, the first withdrawal from the service must be at least RM1,000 while subsequent withdrawals have to be in multiples of RM100
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the document explicitly noted the minimum loan amount, it didn’t provide any information regarding the maximum amount of loan that customers can obtain from the service

            <p>
                That being said, several screenshots within the FAQ document noted that the maximum amount of loan is RM100,000

            <p>
                Customers also should take note of other costs that are associated with this service including the stamping fee which is 0.5% of the loan amount, and the RM5 attestation fee for each loan withdrawal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, Shopee Malaysia is currently providing the SLoan service only to selected users for the time being

                Singapore’s Straits Times reports that a psychiatric patient in Selayang Hospital – upset about being stranded in the emergency room along with dozens of others as all wards were full – stabbed another patient earlier today, causing serious injuries

                KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 14 – A patient was seriously injured after getting stabbed by a psychiatric patient today in Selayang Hospital, as the latter was allegedly upset at being stranded in the overcrowded emergency department

            <p>
                Singapore’s The Straits Times reported that all the wards at the public hospital in Selangor were full at the time of the incident and that dozens were waiting in the emergency room

            <p>
                One of the doctors interviewed by CodeBlue said that patients are stranded in the emergency department of Selayang Hospital, a tertiary Ministry of Health (MOH) hospital, for between 24 and 72 hours

                The entry fee, widely criticized by local tourism industry, comes as the nation famed for its Buddhist temples, beaches and national parks is witnessing a rush in tourist arrivals that’s gained momentum with the abolition of pandemic-era curbs and China’s move to end it Zero-Covid policy

                Foreign tourist arrivals may reach as high as 30 million this year, almost tripling from 11.2 million last year, according to some estimates

                Johor Chief Minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi and Singapore Transport Minister S Iswaran, who is also the country's Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, meeting during Mr Onn Hafiz's three-day visit to Singapore on Feb 14, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said at that time that the terminal is a key international entry point that increases access for tourists to come to Johor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Onn Hafiz said that last year, more than 141,000 tourists came from Batam and Tanjung Balai in Indonesia to Puteri terminal via ferry services owned and operated by Malaysia property developer UEM Sunrise.  Mr Onn Hafiz on Tuesday also shared other points of discussions between him and Mr Iswaran.  He said both of them agreed that the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link was a priority for both countries.  “I agree with his suggestion to closely monitor the project's development, and to set short term and medium term goals so that the project continues to be on track,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  The cross-border rail project aims to connect Bukit Chagar in Johor Bahru city to Woodlands in Singapore, serving about 10,000 passengers per hour each way to help ease traffic congestion on the Causeway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is scheduled to be operational by end-2026.  Mr Onn Hafiz also reiterated a commitment he said was made recently by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to increase motorcycle lanes at the immigration complex in Bangunan Sultan Iskandar, which is linked to the Woodlands Causeway.  “It is generally known that the Johor-Singapore Causeway is one of the busiest land crossings in the world, with more than 300,000 Malaysians commuting daily from Johor Bahru to work in Singapore,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  The Machap state assemblyman added that he shared Mr Anwar’s willingness to see through a proposal to widen the lanes of the Johor portion of the North-South Highway.  “If this proposal is implemented, for sure it will benefit the business community in Singapore who wish to invest in Malaysia,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  “I once again express the willingness of the Johor State Government to foster future collaborations between Johor-Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This close ties is significant for both parties,” he added.  Tuesday was the last day of Mr Onn Hafiz’s three-day working visit to Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides Mr Iswaran, he also met with other Singapore leaders like Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan as well as Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman.  The chief minister also held meetings with business leaders as well as foreign corporations based in Singapore.  He said in a statement on Sunday that these companies were potential investors that could rake in between RM10 to RM15 billion (US$2.3 to US$3.45 billion) for the southern state and bring high paying jobs for Johoreans.  “The state government, with the help of the federal government, is committed to be facilitators and prepare utilities and infrastructure, to ensure a friendly business environment for investors across the world,” he added.

            <p>
                The monthly instalment increments from variant to variant are also larger as the loan term decreases

            <p>
                Research Perodua Cars at  Comments Some people who will buy the new Axia will then be stunned at the running costs just going to state the obvious, but if you have to take a 9 year loan to be able to afford a car, it means you can’t afford the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can see the desperation to play down the price increase for a car that’s extremely price sensitive

                Anthony Loke said that road users looking to register for a digital road tax would soon have to input the unique code located behind their driving licence in addition to their IC number during registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that he has discussed this thoroughly with JPJ and the system update will likely roll out soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said the new registration requirement would only apply to those that have yet to register through the JPJ app or website and that existing users would not be required to comply with the new requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the digitalisation of road tax would remain voluntary and there would be no mandate yet on forcing all road users to register into the system

                Anthony Loke said that road users looking to register for a digital road tax would soon have to input the unique code located behind their driving licence in addition to their IC number during registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that he has discussed this thoroughly with JPJ and the system update will likely roll out soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said the new registration requirement would only apply to those that have yet to register through the JPJ app or website and that existing users would not be required to comply with the new requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the digitalisation of road tax would remain voluntary and there would be no mandate yet on forcing all road users to register into the system

                Puteri Sarah filed for leave to initiate committal proceedings against Ira, whose full name is Faghira Fatini, her sister Yasmin, and Kazaruddin over an alleged breach of a court injunction following the revelation of Ira's marriage to Puteri Sarah's husband, actor and director Syamsul Yusof, last month

            <p>
                In the leave application filed on Jan 31, Puteri Sarah, whose full name is Puteri Sarah Liyana Megat Kamaruddin, claimed that the three defendants had committed contempt of court when they voluntarily violated an inter-parte injunction order dated July 4 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The injunction order was part of a lawsuit filed by Puteri Sarah in June, after she claimed she was on the receiving end of a barrage of harassment and threats from Ira, 27, via social media

                Loan repayments also only begin 12 months after the borrowers have completed their higher studies to give them time to earn a stable income,” said Khaled To an additional question whether the government has promised to introduce the targeted abolition since it was previously listed as part of the election manifesto, Khaled said one of the parties under the Unity Government had decided to totally abolish PTPTN loan repayments

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 14 — Malaysia is taking steps to strengthen its position through various policy measures, leveraging the existing electric vehicles (EV) ecosystem and ensuring a solid talent pipeline to help the development of the EV industry in Malaysia, said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said Malaysia is seriously looking into policies that will support energy sectors to ensure that the EV ecosystem is complete and fully supported, including standards, certification and verification related to charging systems and battery disposal activities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To capitalise on the EV market, Tengku Zafrul said the government will also strengthen Malaysia’s Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the government has made a firm commitment to strategically develop the automotive industry, particularly the EV industry, as part of the zero greenhouse gas (GHG) target by 2050
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar was responding to questions in relation to relief efforts carried out by Malaysia’s Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (SMART) that was among the first to arrive in Turkey

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 14 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today he may leave for Turkey tonight to show support for the country that was hit by the earthquake last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He told the Parliament that it would be timely for him to leave for Turkey now as various leaders from other countries have also arrived at the scene
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I’m considering leaving for Turkey tonight as Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has asked if it is possible that I could be in Turkey in person,” Anwar told the Dewan Rakyat during the Prime Minister’s Question time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar was responding to questions in relation to relief efforts carried out by Malaysia’s Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (SMART) that was among the first to arrive in Turkey

                The government will instead look to reduce subsidies enjoyed by the wealthy, Anwar, who is also finance minister, told parliament

            <p>
                Anwar, who took office in November, has ordered a review of Malaysia's subsidy programme, prioritising aid for low-income groups, amid high government debt levels and rising living costs

            <p>
                Government debt and liabilities currently stood at 1.5 trillion ringgit ($114.86 billion), or about 82% of GDP, Anwar said

                A right-footed centre-back who plays on the left of a back three doesn’t necessarily sound like a perfect fit for a team that only deviates from a back four occasionally during injury time

                Liverpool will have to fight with the big guns of Italian football to secure Scalvini, but if it can bring him to the club, Klopp would reap short and long-term benefits in two potentially problem positions.

                Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah delivering his Royal Address in the Dewan Rakyat on Monday (Feb 13)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Institute for Research and Development of Policy (IRDP) research and advocacy officer Farhan Rawi said all input and content of the decree are also a good start for MPs to begin their debate on the Royal Address on Tuesday (Feb 14)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you look at it, there are many inputs or information that His Majesty has decreed and it is a policy speech that should be the reference for MPs to see what are the priorities and direction that the government will undertake this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad said that His Majesty’s decree contained three items of significance, namely the togetherness between the Royal Institution and the government, His Majesty’s desire for the existing government administration, thus becoming a stage for the King to give advice not only to the MPs but also to the government and the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad added that the decree by His Majesty, who hoped that the government would be able to carry out its responsibility of governing the country and the Opposition would carry out its responsibility by offering constructive criticism for the good of the people and the country, was something that needed to be heeded by all parties

                China's accusation widened a dispute with United States that began last weekend after the US military shot down what it says was a Chinese spy balloon, prompting top US diplomat Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to Beijing designed to ease tensions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Since last year, US high-altitude balloons have undergone more than 10 illegal flights into Chinese airspace without the approval of the relevant Chinese departments," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular briefing in Beijing in response to a question

                China's assertion comes after the United States shot down what it called a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Feb 4 after it had drifted across the continental United States for days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China said the balloon was a civilian research craft that was mistakenly blown off course and accused the United States of overreacting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wang said he had no information on the latest three objects shot down by the United States

                China's accusation widened a dispute with United States that began last weekend after the US military shot down what it says was a Chinese spy balloon, prompting top US diplomat Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to Beijing designed to ease tensions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Since last year, US high-altitude balloons have undergone more than 10 illegal flights into Chinese airspace without the approval of the relevant Chinese departments," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular briefing in Beijing in response to a question

                China's assertion comes after the United States shot down what it called a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Feb 4 after it had drifted across the continental United States for days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China said the balloon was a civilian research craft that was mistakenly blown off course and accused the United States of overreacting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wang said he had no information on the latest three objects shot down by the United States

                Guardiola was stern in his defence of the club amid more than 100 charges of alleged financial misconduct by the Premier League, and referenced Gerrard's slip in 2014 against Chelsea which helped Manchester City to pip Liverpool to the title

            <p>
                Was that our fault? I have respect for Steven Gerrard - but that moment belongs to us." But looking ahead to Wednesday's league match at Arsenal, Guardiola began his news conference by expressing his shame at his "stupid" comments

                An auction between the English sides could make Schuurs’ asking price rise to €50m and this is the figure the Turin club are targeting from his possible sale in the summer

                United, not for the first time this season, showed that their mentality under Erik ten Hag has turned a corner

                Instead, United dug deep and found a way to win

                He may not have been the scorer on Monday night but he provided the moment of quality Liverpool sorely needed after a full-blooded but ragged 35 minutes, not just with his assist but also with the one-two earlier in the move

            <p>
                In doing so, he displayed a quality that should enable him to become prolific, and make Salah's 'promise' come true.

                It's a belief that's shared in the dressing room at Liverpool, at least based on comments from Salah after the match on Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He may not have been the scorer on Monday night but he provided the moment of quality Liverpool sorely needed after a full-blooded but ragged 35 minutes, not just with his assist but also with the one-two earlier in the move

            <p>
                In doing so, he displayed a quality that should enable him to become prolific, and make Salah's 'promise' come true.

                We believe the industry rebound narrative in 2023, coupled with INTC’s new product, Sapphire Rapid server CPU, and its process node roadmap toward 20A will further improve INTC’s position in the industry

                Our bullish sentiment on INTC is not because we believe the stock will skyrocket in the near term; instead, it's based on our belief that the worst of the macroeconomic headwinds are priced into the stock at current levels

                Climate action towards decarbonisation goal does not match words
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A report titled "The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor" exposes the climate action faultlines.     Despite net-zero pledges made by some of the world’s largest corporations that speak up for efforts to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 36 per cent, only five of 24 companies’ actions represent a commitment to deep decarbonisation in reality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The companies analysed in the study have put themselves forward as climate leaders.  Overall, the study found the climate strategies of 15 of the 24 companies to be of low or very low integrity.  Most of the companies’ strategies do not represent examples of good practice climate leadership, it said, and added companies’ climate change commitments often do not add up to what their pledges might suggest

                Companies’ climate pledges for 2030 fall well short of the required ambition and are inappropriately verified
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The authors found that most of these companies’ future net-zero goals and current climate claims are “exaggerated, false, and misleading”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Overall, the net-zero pledges of the 24 companies translate to a commitment to reduce just 36% of the companies’ combined GHG emission footprint, by the respective net-zero target years.

                About Us Advertise     MICHIGAN, Feb 14 ― At least three people were killed and five injured after a gunman opened fire at Michigan State University last night, as law enforcement swarmed the main campus in East Lansing searching for a lone suspect, police said

                Former Perak DAP assemblyman Paul Yong, who is appealing his conviction last year for raping a former maid, was named a senior vice president in the party

            <p>
                Sri Aman MP Datuk Masir Anak Kujat will be PBM’s new secretary-general following a supreme council meeting held on Feb 10, the party said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The measure had been taken to rekindle the party’s strength so that it can continue to be relevant in building the country alongside the Malaysian unity government,” it said

            <p>
                Prior to the 15th general election, PBM had appeared set to be a platform for several former Pakatan Harapan politicians who joined the controversial “Sheraton Move” in 2020, until a tussle broke out between Sng and Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin who had expected to take over the party
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After a brief confrontation, Sng reasserted control over PBM and reached an accord with Zuraida and her faction, several of whom went on to contest in GE15 on the party’s ticket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, all of the party’s candidates except Sng eventually lost in the election.

                Chief Minister Datuk Hajiji Noor today thanked BN secretary-general Datuk Seri Zambry Abdul Kadir for the coalition’s statement of support, saying it was a welcome move that will help the state move forward with its development agenda
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hajiji also said he had no problem dealing with Sabah BN deputy chief Datuk Yakub Khan as the coalition’s liaison in negotiations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We don’t have issues — as long as it’s good for the people and the state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My intention is to unite everyone and bring good to the state by developing the state with our agenda,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hajiji, who is also Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah (PGRS) president, has the support of 47 assemblymen in the 79-seat state assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Sunday, Zambry announced that the coalition would support Hajiji’s government and also named Yakub Khan as the coalition’s liaison in negotiations with GRS, effectively sidelining Sabah BN and Umno chief Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move saw both Bung and Yakub losing their posts in the state Cabinet.

                Razeef’s statement came in the wake of a tweet by Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin (pic) who indicated that he might be taking a break from politics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I would like to tell Azmin that what he is going through today is due to his betrayal of PKR, Pakatan Harapan and the people who gave him the mandate as the elected representative for Gombak," said Razeef in a statement on Monday (Feb 13)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I would like to advise Azmin that if he wants to take a break, he should take a permanent break from politics given that his credibility has been tainted and the people may not have confidence in a traitor like him, no matter how many times he embarks on a political reset," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azmin’s tweet on Saturday (Feb 11) had left people wondering about his political career
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azmin lost the Gombak parliamentary seat after obtaining 59,538 votes, losing to his former protege Amirudin

                Razeef’s statement came in the wake of a tweet by Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin (pic) who indicated that he might be taking a break from politics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I would like to tell Azmin that what he is going through today is due to his betrayal of PKR, Pakatan Harapan and the people who gave him the mandate as the elected representative for Gombak," said Razeef in a statement on Monday (Feb 13)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I would like to advise Azmin that if he wants to take a break, he should take a permanent break from politics given that his credibility has been tainted and the people may not have confidence in a traitor like him, no matter how many times he embarks on a political reset," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azmin’s tweet on Saturday (Feb 11) had left people wondering about his political career
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azmin lost the Gombak parliamentary seat after obtaining 59,538 votes, losing to his former protege Amirudin

            <p>
                As well as becoming the first Chinese man to win a title, he was also the first in the Open Era to reach a final at tour level and the first to beat a top 10 player, as he dissipated world No 7 Taylor Fritz in the semi-final
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the 23-year-old continues to put his name in the history books for Chinese tennis after jumping a staggering 39 places in the ATP rankings as a result of his win, making him the new world No 58
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It means that Wu is now the highest-ranked Chinese player in ATP history

                The MCA secretary-general said branch-level polls will be held on April 29 and 30, while the divisional-level election will be held on June 10 and 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chong also said state-level polls for the Youth and Wanita wings are set for July and August, but with six state elections expected to be held in May and June, the party might have to make last-minute changes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have the dates for MCA's state-level polls, but we are keeping an eye out for the elections in six states, so we might adjust it,” he said during a press conference at Wisma MCA on Monday (Feb 13)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to him, the MCA national-level elections will commence in September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chong also announced that MCA’s 74th anniversary celebrations will be held on March 4.

                The Chinese vessel also made “dangerous maneuvers” by coming within about 140 metres of the Philippine boat

                The incident happened on February 6 nearly 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, where Philippine marines are stationed, the coast guard said in a statement

                The Chinese Coast Guard vessel shone a “military-grade” green laser light twice at the Philippine ship, “causing temporary blindness to her crew at the bridge”, the statement said

            <p>
                The Chinese vessel also made “dangerous maneuvers” by coming within about 140 metres of the Philippine boat

                is a blatant disregard for, and a clear violation of, Philippine sovereign rights in this part of the West Philippine Sea,“ the Philippine Coast Guard said

                Singapore lenders are set to report their highest quarterly net interest margins in more than a decade on rising interest rates but as the cycle peaks and economic growth falters, profit growth will be curbed, analysts said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DBS Chief Executive Piyush Gupta said in the bank's results statement that interest rate increases are likely to moderate, but he doesn't expect rate cuts this year

            <p>
                The Singapore-based bank warned that there was a downside risk of 5 to 7 basis points to the group's peak net interest margin guidance of 2.25% due to factors including outflows to treasury bills and a strengthening Singapore dollar

            <p>
                DBS, the first Singapore bank to report this season, said October-December net profit rose to a record 2.34 billion Singapore dollars ($1.76 billion) compared with an average estimate of S$2.16 billion from three analysts, according to Refinitiv data, and S$1.39 billion in the same period a year earlier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DBS reported a total net interest margin, a key gauge of profitability, of 2.05% for the latest quarter, up from 1.43% in the same period a year earlier

                Previously, Datuk Misbun Sidek was in charge of the national junior squad as the director of youth development but his position has been redesignated as the specialist singles coach on Friday following Malaysia’s dismal outing in the World Junior Championships in Santander, Spain last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This new structure will give me a new responsibility of creating specialist doubles pairs at a younger age and I would like to contribute to maximise their potential and the KPI is going to be the World Junior Championships and Asian Junior Championships this year,” said Rexy when met at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Sepang yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His load was heavy as he had to manage the entire junior players and they were more than the seniors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This move will help me gauge the level of the junior doubles and the efforts needed to see them progress into better players.” Rexy will be assisted by coach Pang Cheh Chang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I will find two assistants for Cheh Chang to ensure the junior doubles continue with their progress,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheh Chang is set to execute the junior development programme prepared by Rexy who is also expected to constantly monitor the progress of the players besides his own daily duties with the seniors

                Previously, Datuk Misbun Sidek was in charge of the national junior squad as the director of youth development but his position has been redesignated as the specialist singles coach on Friday following Malaysia’s dismal outing in the World Junior Championships in Santander, Spain last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This new structure will give me a new responsibility of creating specialist doubles pairs at a younger age and I would like to contribute to maximise their potential and the KPI is going to be the World Junior Championships and Asian Junior Championships this year,” said Rexy when met at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Sepang yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His load was heavy as he had to manage the entire junior players and they were more than the seniors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This move will help me gauge the level of the junior doubles and the efforts needed to see them progress into better players.” Rexy will be assisted by coach Pang Cheh Chang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I will find two assistants for Cheh Chang to ensure the junior doubles continue with their progress,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheh Chang is set to execute the junior development programme prepared by Rexy who is also expected to constantly monitor the progress of the players besides his own daily duties with the seniors

                About Us Advertise LEEDS, Feb 13 — Erik ten Hag hailed Marcus Rashford as one of Europe’s best forwards after his late goal inspired Manchester United’s 2-0 win against old rivals Leeds on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Rashford scored to spark United’s comeback from two goals down in Wednesday’s 2-2 draw with Leeds, he tormented the Yorkshire club once again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford netted with 10 minutes left at Elland Road to make it four successive Premier League games with a goal for the England forward, who has scored in eight of his last nine appearances in the competition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When he is keeping the investment and keeps the focus in every game and brings the energy and belief, he will keep scoring.” United’s win was just their second in their last five league games, although they have now lost just once in their last 17 matches in all competitions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bitter rivals  Amid a cacophonous noise at Elland Road, Leeds made a frenzied start, with Crysencio Summerville firing over after a mistake from United left-back Tyrell Malacia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After scoring United’s equaliser against Leeds in midweek, Jadon Sancho had been rewarded with his first league start since October, but the England forward was largely anonymous and came off after an hour

            <p>
                The South Jakarta court ruled Ferdy Sambo, the former police chief of internal affairs, guilty of the planned murder of junior police officer Nofriansyah Yosua Hutabarat, Judge Wahyu Iman Santoso said on Monday

            <p>
                Furious, Ferdy summoned another subordinate, junior police officer Richard Eliezer Pudihang Lumliu, 24, and asked if he “had the guts to shoot” Nofriansyah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ferdy told Richard that Nofriansyah had insulted him and that he “must die”, Judge Wahyu told the court

                Critics noted that the National Police Commission (Kompolnas), an independent civilian oversight institution which supervises the police, could only advise the police chief but lacked the authority to issue sanctions.

                Pep Guardiola issues a public apology to Steven Gerrard over comments he made about the former Liverpool captain last week

                Sunday’s bid was for a licence plate with the letter "R” and came at a Lunar New Year auction organised by the Hong Kong Transport Department
            </p>

            <p>
                There have been more than 160 auctions and over 40,000 plates have been registered since the personalised car plate system was introduced in 2006, bringing in more than HK$600 million for the government, according to Lam

            <p>
                People can register to apply for their licence plate of choice, kicking off a process that sometimes lasts as long as 18 months before the plate goes on auction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Applicants must pay HK$5,000 deposit, and if there are no other bidders, then that plate will be theirs for the deposit amount

                “We’re finally seeing real price corrections,” John Downs, senior vice president of Vellum Mortgage, told Yahoo Finance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Home prices remain high, but they are better now and dropping.” After mortgage rates surged to nearly 7% last year, home price growth began to slump across the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For instance, the median home listing price in San Francisco was $1.3 million at year-end, according to Realtor.com, still up 3.7% year over year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the average home sold at $1.25 million, or 3.8% off the median listing price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That means that it now takes $600, or 41%, more to make the monthly payment for a 30-year mortgage on the average priced home — after putting 20% down — compared with a year ago
            </p>

                “We’re finally seeing real price corrections,” John Downs, senior vice president of Vellum Mortgage, told Yahoo Finance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Home prices remain high, but they are better now and dropping.” After mortgage rates surged to nearly 7% last year, home price growth began to slump across the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For instance, the median home listing price in San Francisco was $1.3 million at year-end, according to Realtor.com, still up 3.7% year over year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the average home sold at $1.25 million, or 3.8% off the median listing price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That means that it now takes $600, or 41%, more to make the monthly payment for a 30-year mortgage on the average priced home — after putting 20% down — compared with a year ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That's our theme this year — it’s all about affordability.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance

                Many are wondering if this tweet meant that he was taking a break from politics after his loss in GE15

                Azmin lost the Gombak parliamentary seat after obtaining 59,538 votes, losing to his former protege Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was considered a surprising defeat for Azmin, the International Trade and Industry Minister in the caretaker government, who won the seat in 2018 with 75,113 votes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had held the seat since 2008
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is still the Bukit Antarabangsa assemblyman as Selangor has yet to dissolve its state assembly.

                Through a statement issued by Selangor Water Management Authority (Luas), Hee said the spill which took place on the banks of Sungai Selangor was located three kilometres away from the Rantau Panjang WTP main water intake

            <p>
                Luas had taken immediate action by placing three oil booms and three boxes of oil pads in the affected area to prevent the spill from flowing into the river

                The barrage doors were also closed at the WTPs to quicken dilution and prevent the polluted raw water from spreading further away from the main water intake area

            <p>
                Operations to the WTPs resumed at 6.30am on Sunday (Feb 12) after the raw water was re-channelled to the Rantau Panjang plants at 1.30am and the Sungai Selangor Phase 1,2, 3 WTPs at 2.15am following three subsequent scent detection tests which rendered readings of 0 ton each time on Sunday

                Ramasamy, who is Penang DAP deputy and the state deputy chief minister, is currently under fire from fellow members of the ruling coalition government and the Opposition for seeking urgent reform to the “ossified civil service” he posted on Facebook two days ago

            <p>

                Ramasamy, who is Penang DAP deputy and the state deputy chief minister, is currently under fire from fellow members of the ruling coalition government and the Opposition for seeking urgent reform to the “ossified civil service” he posted on Facebook two days ago

            <p>

            <p>
                He managed to hold serve, break Fritz and hold again to pocket the set, and made a break in the fifth game of the third set stand up for his first career win over a top-10 player

                0f24b6f7-0f13-4ce0-a0e0-867050131744_93b1e156 A 38-year-old man is taken for a check-up at a psychiatric hospital in China by his mother every Lunar New Year because he is single
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A video of the man – from the central Chinese province of Henan – which was reported on by Sohu News and The Beijing News, has gone viral and provoked a lively debate about the pressure to marry on the mainland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the clip – which has been viewed more than 4 million times – the man, surnamed Wang, says that he has never brought a girlfriend home at Lunar New Year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bizarre “diagnosis” has meant that since 2020, his family has developed a strange tradition, following each Lunar New Year holiday, his mother takes him to see a psychiatrist

                On February 4, Wang was once again taken by his mother to the Henan Provincial Psychiatric Hospital

            <p>
                This time, however, the doctor told the mother that her son was not ill but that it was her who had had a problem as she had developed the mental disorder of “forcing her son to marry”

                She said the Education Ministry (MOE) has detailed data and information related to dilapidated schools and plans to resolve the issue, which is one of the aspirations under the ministry’s seven main thrusts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was asked to comment on Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s statement yesterday that the government will prioritise immediate solutions to the issue of dilapidated schools in the country for the welfare of students and boost the country’s education standards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Fadhlina said MOE also welcomed the Prime Minister’s call for the ministry to open the space for students and its staff to express their views to the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said MOE has no problem accepting constructive views or criticism because it is important to help strengthen the education system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So I welcome this call, and I think this is one of the safe spaces if we can criticise constructively and hold discussions to build a better education (system) for Malaysia,” she said

                Gabrielle, downgraded to a sub-tropical low pressure system from a Category 2 cyclone, hit Norfolk Island on Saturday night, with its most destructive winds missing the island, before tracking to New Zealand, 1,460km (910 miles) south

            <p>

                After challenging for the quadruple last season and hitting the maximum possible fixture count, Klopp's side have struggled this year and sit 10th in the league after 20 games

                Liverpool are expected to 'back Jurgen Klopp to revamp his squad this summer' It comes after a shocking start to the season that has seen Liverpool slump to 10th after 20 league games The Times also claim Liverpool will be buoyed by the introduction of a new head of eesearch, as the club has already picked a candidate who is 'working in the game and regarded as a leading operator in the football data field.' They will replace Dr Ian Graham in the role, who may prove a tough act to follow as he is credited with masterminding a number of Liverpool's key signings in the last decade, including that of Klopp

                “It won’t be at first because people are still adapting to this new system

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, Feb 12 — The odour pollution incident which forced four water treatment plants (LRAs) in the state to be shut down temporarily last night was caused by a fuel spill, believed to be diesel from heavy machinery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                State Tourism, Environment, Green Technology and Orang Asli Affairs Committee chairman Hee Loy Sian said the Selangor Water Management Authority’s (LUAS) investigation along Sungai Selangor found the oil spill at the river bank some three kilometres away from the Rantau Panjang LRA intake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hee said the temporary shutdown of the LRAs intake points for around four hours was a control and preventive measure to avoid worse pollution to the water treatment system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The problem was quickly addressed with the channelling of raw water starting at 10 pm yesterday and lowering the barrage gates at the LRA intake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Hee said that raw water was channelled back to the Rantau Panjang LRA intake at 1.30am and at 2.15am today to the Sungai Selangor Phase 1 (SSP1) LRA, Sungai Selangor Phase 2 (SSP2) LRA and Selangor Phase 3 (SSP3) LRA after recording three consecutive zero TON readings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Pengurusan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd (Air Selangor) announced the temporary shutdown of the Rantau Panjang, SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3 LRAs believed due to an odour pollution incident, causing unscheduled water supply disruptions in eight regions

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, Feb 12 — The odour pollution incident which forced four water treatment plants (LRAs) in the state to be shut down temporarily last night was caused by a fuel spill, believed to be diesel from heavy machinery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                State Tourism, Environment, Green Technology and Orang Asli Affairs Committee chairman Hee Loy Sian said the Selangor Water Management Authority’s (LUAS) investigation along Sungai Selangor found the oil spill at the river bank some three kilometres away from the Rantau Panjang LRA intake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hee said the temporary shutdown of the LRAs intake points for around four hours was a control and preventive measure to avoid worse pollution to the water treatment system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The problem was quickly addressed with the channelling of raw water starting at 10 pm yesterday and lowering the barrage gates at the LRA intake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Hee said that raw water was channelled back to the Rantau Panjang LRA intake at 1.30am and at 2.15am today to the Sungai Selangor Phase 1 (SSP1) LRA, Sungai Selangor Phase 2 (SSP2) LRA and Selangor Phase 3 (SSP3) LRA after recording three consecutive zero TON readings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Pengurusan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd (Air Selangor) announced the temporary shutdown of the Rantau Panjang, SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3 LRAs believed due to an odour pollution incident, causing unscheduled water supply disruptions in eight regions

                Chelsea boss Graham Potter has said some of the club's new signings need to adapt to the Premier League, with the club's January spending spree yet to turn around their poor form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw against West Ham United on Saturday, with Atletico Madrid loanee Joao Felix scoring his first goal for the club before former Chelsea fullback Emerson levelled the game shortly after
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The result means Chelsea have won just once in their last eight matches in all competitions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "You can also see the potential of the team but you can also see where the work is, which is getting Reece James up to speed, which is getting Ben Chilwell up to speed, which is getting Ruben Loftus-Cheek up to speed, which is getting Wesley Fofana up to speed, which is getting N'Golo Kante up to speed, which is adapting [Myhailo] Mudryk into the Premier League, which is adapting [Noni] Madueke into the Premier League, which adapting Benoit Badiashile into the Premier League, which is adapting Joao Felix into the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That's just how it is, that's the way I see it and I'll just be honest to say how it is but I completely understand that people are frustrated if you don't win." Chelsea made eight signings in January and, due to their inflated squad, had to leave defender Badiashile and striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang out of their Champions League roster
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Then you have to have honest conversations and respect the fact that players will be disappointed, because that's normal." Chelsea are ninth in the Premier League table after Saturday's draw and restart their Champions League campaign at Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.

                The policy limits sharing an account to a local "household." How does the policy work in those countries? If a user does not live under the same roof as the main account holder, they are prompted to launch their own Netflix account
            </p>

                Through new updates to the platform, that user's lists and watch recommendations will follow them from their previous household account to their new separate account

            <p>
                Chengyi Long, Netflix's director of product innovation, said back in March that Netflix "always made it easy" for household members to share their account with different profiles for respective family members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Long added that Netflix had created confusion about when and how subscribers can share accounts

            <p>
                What's happening now? No immediate changes have been implemented for Netflix account holders in the United States
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, Netflix's US policy pages say that one account is only meant for people within that primary household

                The policy limits sharing an account to a local "household." How does the policy work in those countries? If a user does not live under the same roof as the main account holder, they are prompted to launch their own Netflix account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Through new updates to the platform, that user's lists and watch recommendations will follow them from their previous household account to their new separate account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chengyi Long, Netflix's director of product innovation, said back in March that Netflix "always made it easy" for household members to share their account with different profiles for respective family members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Long added that Netflix had created confusion about when and how subscribers can share accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What's happening now? No immediate changes have been implemented for Netflix account holders in the United States
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, Netflix's US policy pages say that one account is only meant for people within that primary household

                Wind and rain were spreading from the country’s north, with a 140km per hour wind gust reported on the country’s North Island on Sunday afternoon, MetService said

                The storm was on track to lie off Cape Reinga at the North Island’s north end on Sunday afternoon, after moving away from Norfolk Island, MetService said

            <p>
                On Norfolk Island, which covers just over 34 square km in the Pacific Ocean between New Caledonia and New Zealand, authorities said they were clearing debris and trees from roads and restoring power knocked out in the storm

                SMART MAS-01 search and rescue operations officer (SAR) Insp Muhamad Zul Khairi Idris said the cry of ‘takbir’ (Allahuakbar) when the first victim — a teenage boy — was taken out at 1.20pm (6.20pm Malaysian time) almost brought the team into tears

            <p>
                One by one, the remaining victims were successfully taken out by 2.20pm (7.20pm Malaysian time) in safe condition before being handed over to the local medical team

                Muhamad Zul Khairi said his team of 24 members and a tracking dog (Frankie) had headed to the new search area following information from the reconnaissance team located 1.3 km from the national rescue team camp at Nurdagi Stadium at 11am local time (4pm Malaysian time)

                The comic irony is that Lim is home.  Peter Lim is in Singapore, not in Valencia where the proud club he owns totters from one crisis season to the next and is now on the brink of a relegation battle. This Saturday another huge protest is planned.  The team is due to kick-off its home game with Athletic Bilbao at 9pm local time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even if there are 40,000 protesting Valencia fans outside Mestalla at kick-off on Saturday, and even if that scenario repeats for the rest of the season at every home game, Lim is not going to sell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And for the eighth time in the club's history Salvador Gonzalez, known as 'Voro', became caretaker coach.  The famous club are struggling on the pitch and lie just one point above the relegation zone Gennaro Gattuso left the club in January, the 10th manager to exit in Lim's nine years in charge Remarkably, in his previous stints, he has the third best win ratio of all the Valencia managers under Lim

                The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) Peninsular Malaysia was on Saturday reported to have called on the ministry  to postpone  the use of the IDME which was not stable, apart from claiming that it was not viable yet to fill in the scores of the Final Academic Session (UASA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The IDME, developed by the ministry, is accessed by a single login through its website, and all educators who fill out the UASA and classroom assessment must go through the IDME system, that is, they need to log in to the system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time,  Fadhlina reiterated that the start of the new school calendar will return to January but not in the near future as the justifications must be resolved according to the Education Act 1996 and economic issues and teacher workload would have to be taken into consideration

                Fabio Quartararo has confirmed that Yamaha have supplied him with two new engine specifications at the Sepang MotoGP Test, which is the same number as last year’s Misano test

            <p>
                The 2021 MotoGP champion, who was one of the quickest in terms of top speed on day one, found yet more speed on day two whilst also moving up the leaderboard when it came to overall lap times.  Following an 11th place finish on Friday, Quartararo ended day two less than two tenths away from Jorge Martin after finishing fourth fastest.  "Today was a positive day even if we just had a few laps [in the dry]," said Quartararo

                "We tried an aero package which was actually difficult to know which one was better and if it was better than our standard [one] because we tried with one tyre but then with the same tyre it was more windy.   "We have to try it in a better way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In general, my last run with more than 20 laps on the tyre I was riding pretty fast.  "I’m happy about the day and hopefully tomorrow the weather is better and we can try some new tyres

                About Us Advertise JOHOR BARU, Feb 11 — After a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19, the Chingay Parade Festival returned with a grand celebration which saw a crowd of over 300,000 thronging along Jalan Wong Ah Fook and around the city here, tonight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The procession of over 80 decorated vehicles which covered a distance of about 7.8 kilometres, began at the Xing Gong Temple in Jalan Ulu Air Molek, passed through Jalan Yahya Awal, Jalan Ibrahim, Jalan Wong Ah Fook, Jalan Gereja, Jalan Ngee Heng, Jalan Tun Abdul Razak, finally ended back at Xing Gong Temple, here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A visitor from Kuala Lumpur, Yang Chun Hou, 29 said he was thrilled to watch the parade as this was his first time at the festival

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Hezrina Hedzer, 53, said the last time she attended the parade festival was in 2020 but it was a small celebration

                Premier League • England A Sky Sports panel declared no fewer than nine first-team players have no future at Chelsea, with a high profile England international and two homegrown stars among those tipped to depart
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former players were asked one by one if selected Chelsea players named by presenter Jeff Stelling had a future at Stamford Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Homegrown stars Conor Gallagher and Callum Hudson-Odoi were on the nine-man exit list
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of that list, England international Sterling is perhaps the most surprising
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many players were given a simple “no” when the pundits were posed the question ‘do they have a future at Chelsea?’ However, the pundits went into detail and explained their reasoning behind the Gallagher, Kante and Sterling calls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think he’s been magnificent, we saw what he did at Leicester and Chelsea but I think it’s probably time for him to move on.” Finally, Sherwood assessed £47.5m signing Raheem Sterling who would constitute the most surprising exit on the list

                Premier League • England A Sky Sports panel declared no fewer than nine first-team players have no future at Chelsea, with a high profile England international and two homegrown stars among those tipped to depart
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former players were asked one by one if selected Chelsea players named by presenter Jeff Stelling had a future at Stamford Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Homegrown stars Conor Gallagher and Callum Hudson-Odoi were on the nine-man exit list
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of that list, England international Sterling is perhaps the most surprising
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many players were given a simple “no” when the pundits were posed the question ‘do they have a future at Chelsea?’ However, the pundits went into detail and explained their reasoning behind the Gallagher, Kante and Sterling calls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think he’s been magnificent, we saw what he did at Leicester and Chelsea but I think it’s probably time for him to move on.” Finally, Sherwood assessed £47.5m signing Raheem Sterling who would constitute the most surprising exit on the list

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 11 — Tourism, Arts, and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing has reportedly said that travel operators are no longer allowed to list shopping in their tour itineraries for foreign tourists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We will issue a circular that states that tour guides are not allowed to take visitors shopping and should not include shopping destinations in their itineraries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that other countries had also implemented similar bans and his ministry would take necessary action if incoming tours continue to include shopping trips
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Tour operators could schedule breaks for a day or two so tourists could choose where to go shopping,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tiong urged travel groups to create itineraries that can showcase Malaysia’s unique culture and leave a good impression on tourists
            </p>
