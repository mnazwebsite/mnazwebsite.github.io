                The government's special secretariat to tackle the Sulu Sultanate's claims against the Malaysian government said that the Paris Court of Appeal had decided on Tuesday (March 14) that the challenge filed by the Sulu claimants is inadmissible

            <p>
                In February last year, the Paris Court of Arbitration through arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa ordered Malaysia to pay US$14.9bil to the self-proclaimed heirs of the Sulu sultanate

            <p>
                Subsequently, on July 12, 2022, the pre-trial judge of the Paris Court of Appeal ordered the unconditional stay of enforcement in France of the purported Final Award pending the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal on the set-aside proceedings, on the ground that it will likely affect Malaysia’s territorial sovereignty

            <p>
                On July 27, 2022, the Sulu claimants filed a challenge against the stay order, to which the hearing on the merits was held on Jan 16, 2023.

                By Aishwarya Nair and Tim Hepher (Reuters) -Boeing Co predicted a surge in worldwide aircraft financing towards pre-pandemic levels this year, highlighting a rebound in demand for air travel just as aviation was swept up in a stock market rout over banking sector woes on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The availability of finance for the 1,000 or more new jetliners rolling off production lines each year is a key barometer for the $100-billion-plus a year jet industry, dominated by Boeing and its European rival Airbus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, Boeing forecasts drawn up before this week's chill in the banking sector, and published on Wednesday, suggest airlines will absorb $94 billion in delivery funding this year, close to $98 billion seen in 2019 and well above $69 billion last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Boeing said capital markets, bank debt and government export credits would all expand this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Boeing's forecast was the first since the planemaker folded decades-old standalone financing arm Boeing Capital into its airplanes unit as part of a corporate streamlining
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leasing firms may face more competition from other sources of finance this year, Boeing predicted in Wednesday's report

                By Aishwarya Nair and Tim Hepher (Reuters) -Boeing Co predicted a surge in worldwide aircraft financing towards pre-pandemic levels this year, highlighting a rebound in demand for air travel just as aviation was swept up in a stock market rout over banking sector woes on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The availability of finance for the 1,000 or more new jetliners rolling off production lines each year is a key barometer for the $100-billion-plus a year jet industry, dominated by Boeing and its European rival Airbus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, Boeing forecasts drawn up before this week's chill in the banking sector, and published on Wednesday, suggest airlines will absorb $94 billion in delivery funding this year, close to $98 billion seen in 2019 and well above $69 billion last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Boeing said capital markets, bank debt and government export credits would all expand this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Boeing's forecast was the first since the planemaker folded decades-old standalone financing arm Boeing Capital into its airplanes unit as part of a corporate streamlining

            <p>
                Leasing firms may face more competition from other sources of finance this year, Boeing predicted in Wednesday's report

                The first prediction is that mortgage rates could fall if the Federal Reserve backs off from future rate hikes, which Olsen writes "appeared imminent just weeks ago." Already, financial markets have pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.75%—down from last week's peak of 7.05%
            </p>

                If the Fed doesn't issue a rate hike in March, some analysts think mortgage rates would sink even further

            <p>
                "For buyers shopping now—especially in high-priced areas—a sustained rate drop will be a welcome boost to affordability, but they should still plan on rate volatility." That said, if Silicon Valley Bank's collapse forewarns of a looming 2023 recession, Olsen writes the affordability gains from lower mortgage rates could be muted by economic pain

                In Germany, the Polo starts from 20,830 Euros, while the Golf starts from 31,145 Euros, so they’re right in the sense that a production ID.2 would be priced around a specced up Polo

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, March 16 — The latest round of job cuts at Meta have led some workers in the technology field here, including one Apple employee, to fear for their job security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking to TODAY on Wednesday (March 15), a 33-year-old contract worker with tech firm Apple said that although the company has assured the teams that there will not be job cuts, employees such as herself remain worried about their future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What workers say The contract worker from Apple’s office in Singapore said that the spate of layoffs in the industry have been “on everyone’s minds”, with their worries further exacerbated by Meta’s latest move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, machine learning developers would form the core team of a machine-learning company, or data scientists would form the core team of an artificial intelligence company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A TikTok employee in her 20s said that she was “not too worried” about her job security because she had “grown numb” to all the news about layoffs in the sector since late last year

                GE rose 5,600% from $2.38 the day before Welch took over to $135.69 the day he left, compared with a 700% rise in the S&P

                (All the numbers in the story, from Yahoo Finance, don’t include dividends, and are adjusted for GE’s 1-for-8 reverse stock in 2021 and this year’s spinoff of GE HealthCare.) Welch was widely worshipped
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Welch’s successors—Jeff Immelt for 16 years and John Flannery for 14 months—couldn’t keep the game going the way Welch did
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Welch, who talked a lot about how important it was for a CEO to appoint a terrific successor, sponsored a public competition among Immelt and two other GE executives, both of whom left the company after Welch appointed Immelt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stock went from being a can’t-lose under Welch to a can’t-win under his successors

                KUALA NERUS, 15 Mac -- Presiden UMNO yang juga Timbalan Perdana Menteri Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi menyampaikan ucapan pada Majlis Pengenalan Calon-Calon Naib Presiden dan Majlis Kerja Tertinggi (MKT) bagi pemilihan UMNO 2023-2026 di sebuah hotel hari ini.

                He said although Umno wanted to focus on strengthening the Unity Government, it would be wise to adopt a positive stance because anything was possible in politics

            <p>
                "The question of Muafakat Nasional depends on who will lead the party to make the move to exit, but maybe if there is a change in leadership, the direction will change," he told reporters after the Terengganu-level session to introduce candidates for the Umno elections here

            <p>
                He said this when asked on the latest development regarding Muafakat Nasional, a cooperative platform formed in 2019 by Umno and PAS

                Agriculture and Food Security Deputy Minister Chan Foong Hin said as the country’s main rice importer, Bernas needed to fulfil 10 social obligations without getting any grants from the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The obligations include managing the country’s rice buffer stock, maintaining its role as the last padi purchaser at a minimum price, and managing padi price subsidy payments as well as the scheme for millers, Bumiputera wholesalers and farmers’ cooperatives
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from this, Bernas also had to allocate funds for supply of machinery and padi mechanisation, development of large-scale padi farms and providing allocations for several programmes, including development of padi seed buffer stock, padi cultivation disaster fund aid and an information system on padi and rice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Furthermore, Bernas now also gives a cash contribution of RM60mil and shares 30% of its net profit from rice imports with farmers this year," he said when winding up the debate on the Supply Bill 2023 at the committee stage on behalf of the ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, several parties had questioned the extension of Bernas’ concession period as the country’s sole rice importer but the government stressed that it was necessary to ensure the commodity remains stable and under control

                Credit Suisse’s share price plunged as much as 31%, in the biggest one-day selloff on record, before paring declines to 16%

                Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc slid 4%, and the KBW Bank Index, a gauge of regional lenders, traded at the lowest since 2020

                “Markets see a Credit Suisse collapse almost there, yet financials still look healthy.” CEO Koerner on Tuesday pointed to the firm’s liquidity coverage ratio, which indicates the bank can handle more than a month of heavy outflows in a period of stress

                Shares of Credit Suisse fell  more than 20 per cent on Wednesday  Even as financial markets across the world, particularly in the US, are still reeling under the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, a noted Wall Street analyst has predicted which bank is likely to collapse next
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Robert Kiyosaki, an investor, author, and Wall Street analyst who predicted the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, believes that Credit Suisse is on the verge of collapse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The problem is the bond market, and my prediction, I called Lehman Brothers years ago, and I think the next bank to go is Credit Suisse, because the bond market is crashing," Fox Business quoted him as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But this little silver coin here is still the best, it's 35 bucks, so I reckon anybody can afford $35, and I'm concerned about Credit Suisse," Kiyosaki, the author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shares of Credit Suisse fell to record lows after its biggest shareholder Saudi National Bank said it could not go above 10 per cent ownership due to a regulatory issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The shares fell by more than 20 per cent following the announcement of Saudi National Bank

                Shares of Credit Suisse fell  more than 20 per cent on Wednesday  Even as financial markets across the world, particularly in the US, are still reeling under the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, a noted Wall Street analyst has predicted which bank is likely to collapse next
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Robert Kiyosaki, an investor, author, and Wall Street analyst who predicted the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, believes that Credit Suisse is on the verge of collapse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The problem is the bond market, and my prediction, I called Lehman Brothers years ago, and I think the next bank to go is Credit Suisse, because the bond market is crashing," Fox Business quoted him as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But this little silver coin here is still the best, it's 35 bucks, so I reckon anybody can afford $35, and I'm concerned about Credit Suisse," Kiyosaki, the author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shares of Credit Suisse fell to record lows after its biggest shareholder Saudi National Bank said it could not go above 10 per cent ownership due to a regulatory issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The shares fell by more than 20 per cent following the announcement of Saudi National Bank

                One of the major ramifications of having a private housing market that is mostly unaffordable is that more Malaysians, including those a bit better-off than current PPR dwellers, could be forced to rely on social housing in the future, when the objective of PPR housing was completely the opposite

                The PPRs, a programme that combined two social housing projects launched in 2002, was meant to offer transitory shelter for urban squatters with the hope that they would eventually afford to own or rent homes in the private market

                This means a good social housing policy should provide decent lives and transition homes for the underprivileged, or security of tenancy and stability that supports a good quality of life, a platform to help the poor take up education or employment and facilitate a transition from social housing to affordable housing or tenancy in the private rental market

            <p>
                “Such conduct by the police is unwarranted and does a great disservice to civil rights and liberties in Malaysia

                Dang Wangi district police chief Assistant Commisioner Noor Dellhan Yahaya issued a statement on March 12 saying that participants into the Women’s March were being investigated for assembling in front of the Sogo shopping centre on Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman in the national capital, and their subsequent street demonstration to Dataran Merdeka earlier that day

                About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, March 15 — The Election Court today struck out Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Masyarakat president Datuk Peter Anthony’s election petition against Tenom MP Reduan Rubin Balang for failing to prove there was any breach of procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Dean Wayne Daly ruled that Peter’s election petition did not comply with Rule 4(1)(b) of the Election Petition Rules, read with Section 32(b) of the Election Offences Act, and struck out the petition with costs of RM 20,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The judge had also ruled that Peter was a convicted criminal under Article 48(1)(e) at the time of nomination and was therefore disqualified under Article 48(5) of the Federal Constitution from contesting in GE15.” Peter is also Melalap assemblyman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Peter’s lawyer Datuk Ansari Abdullah, argued that Article 48(5) did not apply to his client because he had obtained a stay of conviction from the Sessions Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is irrelevant that there has been a stay of conviction because a stay only suspends the effects of conviction — it does not cause the conviction to disappear’ said Fuad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On November 5, a riot broke out at the nomination centre in Tenom after Peter’s nomination papers were rejected on Nomination Day for the 15th general election last year

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 15 — The Malaysian government will give priority to reforming laws on bankruptcy to help Malaysians, instead of political financing laws which were more pressing during elections and should have been rolled out before the 15th general election (GE15) last November, minister Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said has said

                Azalina, the minister in the Prime Minister’s Department in charge of law and institutional reform, reportedly acknowledged the importance of laws on political funding and said such laws are on Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s radar

                “We need political financing laws during election time,” she was quoted as saying by news portal Malaysiakini in a joint interview with a few media organisations

            <p>
                On March 6, Azalina had provided updates on law reforms that are being worked on with the aim to bring such changes as quickly as possible, including a planned Political Funding Bill which she said would be referred to a parliamentary special select committee once it is established and that this committee would then engage with members of Parliament on the Bill

                Former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, who was recently charged with abuse of power and money laundering over hundreds of millions of ringgit for his party Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, had questioned why he was being charged when other political parties also receive political funding

                Just a year on from the arrival of Erling Haaland, Liverpool's rivals Chelsea and Manchester United are 'battling' for another blockbuster Premier League striker move

            <p>
                Now, though, there are worrying reports that Osimhen could land in the Premier League this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Osimhen may not be able to match Haaland's output at Manchester City — in fairness, who will? — but, as one of the best strikers in world football right now, he could still be a devastating addition

            <p>
                For Manchester United, he could be one of the missing pieces as it looks to re-establish itself as a title contender

                An MACC source said it was believed the politician’s relative is not the first victim of the 54-year-old ‘Datuk Roy’ – real name Mohd Hussein Mohd Nasir – who was remanded yesterday
            </p>

                A check showed that back in 2020, a ‘Datuk Roy’ had also impersonated an MACC officer in Putrajaya to scam RM60,000 off a man who was being investigated

            <p>
                On March 9, the MACC arrested four people, including an MACC officer and a woman, aged between 40 and 50, for allegedly soliciting and accepting bribes worth RM400,000 to halt an investigation into a Jana Wibawa-related case

                The woman was released on MACC bail, while the other three remained in custody until March 13

                Billionaire brokerage founder Charles Schwab has seen his personal fortune plummet in the aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse over the weekend

                The Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows that Schwab’s fortune fell by 7.7% on Monday thanks to the brokerage’s tumbling share price—a personal loss of $828 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since March 8, Schwab has had $3 billion wiped from his net worth, according to the publication
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Much of Schwab’s fortune is derived from a stake in his eponymous company, where he serves as chairman
            </p>

                Charles Schwab stock nosedived on Monday even in spite of reassurances from Schwab himself and the company’s CEO, Walt Bettinger

                Billionaire brokerage founder Charles Schwab has seen his personal fortune plummet in the aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse over the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Schwab, who founded discount brokerage Charles Schwab Corp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows that Schwab’s fortune fell by 7.7% on Monday thanks to the brokerage’s tumbling share price—a personal loss of $828 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since March 8, Schwab has had $3 billion wiped from his net worth, according to the publication
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Much of Schwab’s fortune is derived from a stake in his eponymous company, where he serves as chairman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Charles Schwab stock nosedived on Monday even in spite of reassurances from Schwab himself and the company’s CEO, Walt Bettinger

                News – Liverpool willing to agree over £88.5million fee – Streamlining moves to secure signing More recently, yesterday, La Gazzetta Dello Sport reported (news image provided below) that it is almost obvious the French international will leave the Bianconeri for free in the summer transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gazzetta claim the former Paris Saint-Germain midfielder was close to joining Manchester United last summer but this summer, “Watch out for Liverpool”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool need a flexible midfielder, who can be productive in both the defensive and attacking thirds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In your opinion, should they agree a deal to sign Adrien Rabiot? Your email address will not be published

                (Bloomberg) -- Moody’s Investors Service placed First Republic Bank and five other US lenders on review for downgrade, the latest sign of concern over the health of regional financial firms following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank

            <p>
                Earlier, the Court of Appeal’s majority decision was also of the view that SIS Forum had failed to show that the 2014 fatwa issued by the Selangor fatwa committee was ultra vires or had gone beyond its powers under the 2003 Selangor law

                The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court decision which said the 2014 fatwa had not gone against the Printing Presses and Publications Act’s (PPPA) Section 7 and the Communications and Multimedia Act’s (CMA) Section 3(3)

                The Court of Appeal said the High Court was not wrong to say that the 2014 Selangor fatwa only makes publications with liberalism and religious pluralism forbidden and does not give the Selangor fatwa committee to seize such publications, as the power to prohibit publications is still in the hands of the home minister

                Harris was the one who had filed the lawsuit in the High Court in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, to seek a court order to direct the Malaysian government to declassify its investigation report on the June 6, 1976 plane crash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 8, the High Court in Kota Kinabalu issued a court order to direct the Malaysian government to take the necessary steps to declassify or make public the Malaysian authorities’ investigation report on the “Double Six” incident involving a Nomad Aircraft 9M-ATZ plane with 11 people onboard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court had ordered the Malaysian government to comply with the order to declassify the report within three months or by June 8 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court also said that if such public disclosure of the investigation report requires any related action by the Australian government, the Malaysian government must immediately ensure the Australian government acts accordingly to enable the declassification to be done promptly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian government’s investigation team included the Department of Civil Aviation, the Royal Malaysian Air Force, the Royal Malaysian Police, while the Australian government also had a separate investigation team involving the aircraft’s manufacturer Government Aircraft Factory of Australia and the Australian Department of Transport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among other things, High Court judge Datuk Christopher Chin Soo Yin had in his March 8 decision said that it is in the public interest for the Malaysian government to declassify the investigation report

                In a poll of 28 market watchers conducted this week, all participants predicted the PBOC would keep the interest rate on the one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) unchanged at 2.75 per cent

                The target was at the low end of expectations, as policy sources had recently told Reuters a range as high as 6 per cent could be set

                The Carabao Cup is the least desired trophy in England but it's a trophy nonetheless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although supporters won't want to be reminded, at this stage of the season last year, United had been knocked out of the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Champions League, whilst they had just been defeated 4-1 by Manchester City in the league
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Carabao Cup has been won, whilst the FA Cup and the Europa League remain realistic avenues for more silverware, which means United have already played 41 matches - just eight fewer than they did during the whole of last season (49)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United have 12 matches remaining in the Premier League alone and they are going to end the campaign having played significantly more matches than they did last season

                Ten Hag has embraced each competition and he's been rewarded

                Ten Hag does not like to rotate his players but it's logical to change the team in this scenario

                The Carabao Cup is the least desired trophy in England but it's a trophy nonetheless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although supporters won't want to be reminded, at this stage of the season last year, United had been knocked out of the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Champions League, whilst they had just been defeated 4-1 by Manchester City in the league
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Carabao Cup has been won, whilst the FA Cup and the Europa League remain realistic avenues for more silverware, which means United have already played 41 matches - just eight fewer than they did during the whole of last season (49)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United have 12 matches remaining in the Premier League alone and they are going to end the campaign having played significantly more matches than they did last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has embraced each competition and he's been rewarded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag does not like to rotate his players but it's logical to change the team in this scenario

                The question is which hybrid system will it get? Toyota has a few different ways of building a hybrid system around its larger engines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However recently Toyota also introduced a different type of hybrid system built for the demands of a full sized truck, which is most likely what will be used in the LX 700h
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The system is called the i-FORCE MAX and made its debut in the Toyota Tundra pickup truck
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The i-FORCE MAX is a more traditional hybrid system in the sense that it puts a motor into a 10-speed transmission’s bell housing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the Tundra, the i-FORCE MAX engine + motor system produces 437 horsepower and 790 Nm of torque, compared to the non-hybrid version’s 389 hp and 649 Nm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no plug-in feature on the Tundra, so if the big Lexus shares the same system, it’s likely the LX 700h won’t have a plug-in feature either

                The i-FORCE MAX is a more traditional hybrid system in the sense that it puts a motor into a 10-speed transmission’s bell housing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the Tundra, the i-FORCE MAX engine + motor system produces 437 horsepower and 790 Nm of torque, compared to the non-hybrid version’s 389 hp and 649 Nm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no plug-in feature on the Tundra, so if the big Lexus shares the same system, it’s likely the LX 700h won’t have a plug-in feature either

                Judge Datuk Christopher Chin Soo Yin handed down the sentence on Loi Kwong Kiat, 53, after ruling there was clear evidence that the accused had engaged in the sale of narcotics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They were charged under Section 39B(1) (a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act, punishable under subsection 39B(2) of the same Act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Act provides for the death sentence upon conviction or life imprisonment and whipping of not less than 15 strokes if not sentenced to death

            <p>
                In his ruling, Judge Chin said that by virtue of the Criminal Procedure Code, the court was obliged not to nit-pick the evidence adduced by the prosecution but to assess the case on the totality of the evidence
            </p>

                Alejandro Garnacho could be set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines following a heavy tackle from Kyle Walker-Peters during Manchester United's draw with Southampton Manchester United have been rocked by the news that the injury Alejandro Garnacho sustained in Sunday's stalemate with Southampton is worse than initially feared
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Garnacho, 18, has made a big impression after breaking into the first-team picture under Erik ten Hag this season and even earned his first senior international call-up for Argentina last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Garnacho was in contention to win his first senior cap after the winger made the decision to represent Argentina over Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his failure to make the world champion's squad, Garnacho has enjoyed a breakthrough season at club level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's why I called him off but I think it is not too bad."  If Garnacho's injury does lead to an extended spell on the sidelines, then the youngster's season could be brought to a premature end
            </p>

                Alejandro Garnacho could be set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines following a heavy tackle from Kyle Walker-Peters during Manchester United's draw with Southampton Manchester United have been rocked by the news that the injury Alejandro Garnacho sustained in Sunday's stalemate with Southampton is worse than initially feared
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Garnacho, 18, has made a big impression after breaking into the first-team picture under Erik ten Hag this season and even earned his first senior international call-up for Argentina last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Garnacho was in contention to win his first senior cap after the winger made the decision to represent Argentina over Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his failure to make the world champion's squad, Garnacho has enjoyed a breakthrough season at club level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's why I called him off but I think it is not too bad."  If Garnacho's injury does lead to an extended spell on the sidelines, then the youngster's season could be brought to a premature end

                Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had tapped former Fannie Mae head Mayopoulos as CEO of the newly created entity, named Silicon Valley Bank N.A, after the regulator took control of SVB following its collapse that crippled stocks and triggered concerns of a contagion throughout global markets

            <p>
                The regulator transferred all deposits of Silicon Valley Bank to this newly created bridge bank and had said all depositors will have access to their money beginning Monday morning

                In 2019, international tourism receipts accounted for just 0.9% of China's gross domestic product
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the resumption of visa issuance for tourist marks a broader push by Beijing to normalise two-way travel between China and the world, having withdrawn its advisory to citizens against foreign travel in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Areas in China that required no visas before the pandemic will revert to visa-free entry, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In terms of tourism, China is no longer a hotspot destination," said an executive at China International Travel Services in Beijing, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2022, just 115.7 million cross-border trips were made in and out of China, with foreigners accounting for around 4.5 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By contrast, China logged 670 million overall trips in 2019 before the arrival of COVID, with foreigners accounting for 97.7 million

                Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd senior analyst Kenneth Leong said there would be marginal or no impact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Echoing Leong, Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of equity research Thong Pak Leng said the crisis would have little impact on Bursa Malaysia and is not worrying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “(There may be a) little impact but we don't need to worry because the US banking system is different from ours
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thong believes the selldown today was unjustified as the Malaysian banking system is highly regulated where asset quality risks are well contained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bursa Malaysia opened broadly lower today as market participants kept a close watch on any potential downside risk to the local financial situation following the collapse of SVB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli, in a Twitter post, said he does not expect any direct impact on Malaysian companies arising from the collapse of SVB as no Malaysian firm has deposited at SVB

                The Federal Court initially fixed this Wednesday to hear Laidlaw’s appeal as well as the applications by the public prosecutor and three others to strike out Laidlaw’s appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court had also set the same day to hear the public prosecutor’s application to intervene in Laidlaw’s appeal

            <p>
                Laidlaw had filed the appeal after the High Court rejected his application to be admitted as an advocate and solicitor on July 21 last year

            <p>
                The public prosecutor, who was not named as a respondent in Laidlaw’s appeal, subsequently filed an intervener application to be included as the fourth respondent in his appeal as it said it was a party in the proceedings at the High Court but was unilaterally dropped in the appeal

                Lalitha has been fixed for four days beginning July 9 next year, according to the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam, 59, filed the suit against Lalitha, 50, on Jan 12 last year over a defamatory article published by the Independent News Service (INS) news agency portal related to a purchase of shares
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam’s counsel Mohd Shahir Md Tahir said the court fixed the new trial dates before Justice Akhtar Tahir
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defamation suit was previously set to be heard on Jan 8 to 11 next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam claimed that the articles were sensational, scandalous and offensive and were written and republished with malicious intent to give a bad perception to the readers that the plaintiff was a corrupt civil servant or one who has abused his position as a senior MACC official for his or his sibling’s interests
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Lalitha through her statement of defence filed on Feb 3 last year, claimed that the contents of the articles and her tweets involving Azam were obtained from legitimate sources

                Lalitha has been fixed for four days beginning July 9 next year, according to the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam, 59, filed the suit against Lalitha, 50, on Jan 12 last year over a defamatory article published by the Independent News Service (INS) news agency portal related to a purchase of shares
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam’s counsel Mohd Shahir Md Tahir said the court fixed the new trial dates before Justice Akhtar Tahir
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defamation suit was previously set to be heard on Jan 8 to 11 next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam claimed that the articles were sensational, scandalous and offensive and were written and republished with malicious intent to give a bad perception to the readers that the plaintiff was a corrupt civil servant or one who has abused his position as a senior MACC official for his or his sibling’s interests
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Lalitha through her statement of defence filed on Feb 3 last year, claimed that the contents of the articles and her tweets involving Azam were obtained from legitimate sources

            <p>
                Country Garden said in a filing its estimated net loss would be between 5.5 billion yuan to 7.5 billion yuan ($799 million to $1.09 billion), down from a 26.8 billion yuan profit in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It attributed the big loss to a drop in gross profit margin, a rise in provisions for impairments on property projects, and net foreign exchange losses it expected to report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said core net profit was expected to be in the range of 1 billion yuan to 3 billion yuan, still positive but down sharply from 26.9 billion yuan in 2021 and well below analysts' forecasts for core profit around 9.3 billion yuan, according to SmartEstimate

                Smaller developer Logan Group Co Ltd also said it expected to record a net loss of 7 billion yuan to 9 billion yuan for 2022

                He explained that Proton meets the necessary criteria to qualify as a national car brand because the company’s majority stake is locally owned and continues to employ 8,500 workers who are 99 per cent Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In addition, Proton has appointed more than 180 Tier-1 local companies that are involved in the overall supply chain, while the average value of local procurement is in between 75 per cent to 80 per cent especially for the models developed locally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liew explained that the National Automotive Policy 2020 (NAP 2020) which lists the criteria for Malaysian vehicles can be used as a guide for Proton’s status as a national car brand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that to qualify as a national car brand, it must be majority owned by Malaysians and focus on the development of local supply chains
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liew said like other local vehicle manufacturing companies such as Perodua, Honda, Toyota and Volvo, Proton is also given direct tax incentives based on the manufacturing activities carried out because it involves activities that are encouraged
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Based on the contribution of Proton and Perodua to the local automotive industry, both companies are still treated as national car manufacturers

                Touch n’ Go (TnG) has unveiled a new feature for its mobile eWallet that aims to make paying for your parking more seamless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the new tool, you can just scan the QR code in your eWallet to enter and exit a parking lot without needing a physical ticket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just like the latter, there aren’t any surcharges to use the QR code method to pay for parking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the company, you only need to tap on the “Pay” function when you launch the eWallet app to have it scanned at entry and exit points of supported parking lots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will then issue you a parking ticket so you can make a manual payment
            </p>
            
            <p>

                US President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the banking crisis after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on Mar 13, 2023

                Martin Odegaard was on target as Arsenal comfortably beat Fulham 3-0 on Sunday afternoon Jamie Redknapp believes that currently Odegaard is the best midfielder in the Premier League  'Normally you would say De Bruyne is the best midfielder not just in the league but in the world, but something isn't quite right.  'Odegaard does this thing, all great players possess it, it's like time stands still when he has the ball.  'The calmness he possesses

                For NFL stars and those of us sitting and watching football at home, one of the first steps to financial security is “understanding your cash flow deeply,” according to Mike Olivia, a registered financial advisor with the NFL
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s essential to know how much money you have coming in, how much you’re spending, how much goes to debt and taxes, and how much you have left over for saving and investing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Olivia said he encourages NFL players to “run their career as if it's a business,” which means they need to understand financial statements like the balance sheet, income statements, cash flow, and equity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With professional athletes, because they’re generating so much of their lifetime earnings in a short period of time, they may be able to save 80% of that income,” Olivia explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With that much money tied up in savings, NFL stars can really capitalize on compound interest

                Like the NFL star, you might want to consider expenditures you can say no to

                In a memorandum of understanding on the employment and protection of Indonesian domestic servants signed on April 1 last year, the total cost for Malaysian employers to bring in Indonesian maids was capped at RM15,000

                Real Madrid defender Eder Militao has named two players to be wary of heading into Wednesday night’s second leg at the Bernabeu – although one of them is unlikely to even start for Liverpool

                Japanese retail giant Seven and I Holdings founder and honorary chairman Masatoshi Ito died of old age on Mar 10, 2023

            <p>
                Gavi, 18, signed a new contract at Camp Nou in September until 2026 but the Spanish top-flight did not clear the deal because Barca were in excess of their spending limit

                31, a court ordered LaLiga to accept Gavi's registration, with his previous terms due to expire this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ruling said that a failure to do so "would imply the player's free agency and therefore cause serious, irreparable damage to Barca." However, LaLiga said that judgement has now been overturned because Barca missed a deadline, invalidating Gavi's new contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "LaLiga received a notification from the 10th Commercial Court of Barcelona informing of the lifting of the precautionary measures agreed in the Gavi case," LaLiga said in a statement on Monday

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aside from the Triton, Mitsubishi also has a Pickup Platform Vehicle (PPV) on the way, which is very likely a new generation of the Pajero Sport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also mentioned during Mitsubishi’s presentation is a new generation of the Xpander, which it says has been highly regarded since it was launched in 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will come with a “Wet mode” that is being introduced for the first time in a Mitsubishi vehicle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the rest of the models, they are an MPV, a three-row SUV, an Alliance BEV and a MPV with hybrid power
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For other regions, there will be a new kei car, the Colt (based on the Renault Clio) and another Alliance BEV
            </p>

                About Us Advertise JAKARTA, March 13 — Authorities in Indonesia’s popular holiday island of Bali have asked the central immigration agency to cancel a visa-on-arrival policy for Russian and Ukrainian nationals after tourists were found working illegally

            <p>
                At least four Russian citizens were deported this month for visa violations and immigration authorities have repeatedly warned foreigners in Bali against working on tourist visas

            <p>
                Bali Governor I Wayan Koster said yesterday he has asked the Ministry of Law and Human Rights to tighten visa requirements by cancelling the visa-on-arrival facility specifically for Russian and Ukrainian citizens due to a series of violations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Because they are at war, so they flocked to Bali, including those who sought comfort or came to work here,” he said, according to a post on the immigration agency’s Instagram account

                (AP) — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday that the federal government would not bail out Silicon Valley Bank, but is working to help depositors who are concerned about their money

            <p>
                But she emphasized that the situation was much different from the financial crisis almost 15 years ago, which led to bank bailouts to protect the industry

                "It’s resilient.” Silicon Valley Bank is the nation’s 16th-largest bank

                Mohamed Salah had a terrible game and missed a penalty in Liverpool's 1-0 defeat by Bournemouth on Saturday and John Aldridge picked up on his poor body language  Liverpool may have to consider selling Mohamed Salah in the summer transfer window to help fund Jurgen Klopp’s rebuild, according to former player John Aldridge

                Salah endured a miserable time in Liverpool's 1-0 defeat by Bournemouth on Saturday as he missed a penalty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aldridge was shocked by how poor his old side were – and reserved particular criticism for Salah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between now and then, Salah has to lead Liverpool as the senior striker – and he simply didn’t do that at Bournemouth." Salah signed a three-year contract extension with Liverpool last summer, tying him to the club until June 2025

                In its court filing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has said that marriage is accepted "statutorily, religiously and socially” only between a biological man and a biological woman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just a handful of places outside of the West - and only Taiwan in Asia - allow same-sex marriage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Indian government’s position on the issue has, however, remained the same since 2020, when a similar stance to oppose same-sex marriages was taken before a lower court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Invoking the idea of family, the Modi government in its affidavit has said that cohabitation of same-sex partners cannot be compared with the "Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children.” At least three lawyers representing the petitioners in the case declined to comment on the government’s affidavit ahead of the court hearing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While stressing the accepted societal norm on the concept of family and marriage, the government has laid down a plethora of statutory provisions of law that will be impacted if registration of same-sex marriages is permitted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The same government had however refrained from taking any position before the court in 2018, when the legal battle for decriminalizing homosexuality was fought

            <p>
                In its court filing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has said that marriage is accepted "statutorily, religiously and socially” only between a biological man and a biological woman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just a handful of places outside of the West - and only Taiwan in Asia - allow same-sex marriage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Indian government’s position on the issue has, however, remained the same since 2020, when a similar stance to oppose same-sex marriages was taken before a lower court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Invoking the idea of family, the Modi government in its affidavit has said that cohabitation of same-sex partners cannot be compared with the "Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children.” At least three lawyers representing the petitioners in the case declined to comment on the government’s affidavit ahead of the court hearing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While stressing the accepted societal norm on the concept of family and marriage, the government has laid down a plethora of statutory provisions of law that will be impacted if registration of same-sex marriages is permitted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The same government had however refrained from taking any position before the court in 2018, when the legal battle for decriminalizing homosexuality was fought
            </p>

                Its SWN for 4G LTE started in 2014 as a joint public-private venture between Rwanda’s government and South Korean operator Korea Telecom (KT) with no concurrent 4G spectrum allocation or granting spectrum neutrality to MNOs by law
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The best thing that can be done to rescue Malaysia swiftly from any further damage inflicted by DNB’s SWN experiment is to allow the major MNOs (most of whom are publicly listed companies) to 100% take over DNB with an equal stake in it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will immediately relieve the government of the substantial financial burden of salvaging DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tech-neutrality for network deployment must also be guaranteed to MNOs to support further efficiency, innovation and competition in our telecom industry

                A general view shows hazy conditions due to air pollution in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand on March 10, 2023

            <p>
                Permanent secretary for Public Health Ministry Dr Opas Karnkawinpong said this week, air pollution-related diseases showed an increasing trend, from 161,839 to 196,311 cases
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said air pollution-related diseases reported included 583,238 cases of respiratory disease, 267,161 (skin infections), 242,805 (eye infections) and 208,880 (cardiovascular and cerebrovascular)

                From Jan 1 to March 5 this year, more than 1.3 million people have fallen sick due to air pollution, he said

                As of 1 pm (local time) today, the northern city of Chiang Mai’s air quality ranked the worst in the world where its Air Quality Index (AQI) reading was recorded at 191, an unhealthy level, according to IQAir, a Swiss group that measures air quality levels based on PM2.5

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 — Bersatu president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin is confident that he and his Opposition party will overcome all their current adversities and beat the ruling parties to form the federal government at the next general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Despite all that we are still here, and not only that, we were able to defeat the kleptocratic party called Barisan Nasional and Umno; we broke their 60-year dominance,” he said to rapturous applause from hundreds of Bersatu delegates today

            <p>
                Muhyiddin said Bersatu members should be proud that its Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition won 74 federal seats out of 222 in GE15, and managed to form the state government in Perlis, which he noted had been a longtime Umno stronghold, and came close to taking control of Perak and Pahang too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bersatu members from all over the country attended the party’s assembly today to show solidarity with Muhyiddin after he was charged in court with money laundering party funds and corruption last week

                Britain's BBC faced a mounting crisis as a row over football presenter Gary Lineker's criticism of government migration policy led to a presenter mutiny, drew a comment from the prime minister and left the broadcaster's boss defending his position
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Critics of Lineker's suspension say the BBC bowed to government pressure, leading to a furious debate about the impartiality of the national broadcaster
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BBC director-general Tim Davie told the BBC yesterday he had no intention of resigning over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Erik ten Hag has decided on Tottenham forward Harry Kane as his number one target this summer, with Manchester United ready to break their transfer record in order to sign the England captain

                Manchester United news, exclusives and analysis United’s reliance on Marcus Rashford has been showcased in recent weeks, despite the winger continuing a good rate of goalscoring

            <p>
                But, with Anthony Martial making just 12 appearances this season, United desperately need a centre forward and Ten Hag has been weighing up a move for Kane or Napoli striker Victor Osimhen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Mirror say Ten Hag has decided that Kane is his first choice and he’s asked the United board to fund a club record move for the striker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United’s transfer record remains the £89m they spent on Paul Pogba in 2016 but Tottenham are expected to demand £100m if Kane pushes to leave at the end of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag feels Kane can have a ‘Casemiro’ effect on the side, in that his arrival would immediately take the team to the next level.

                United have been linked with Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane and Napoli’s Victor Omishen, but transfer expert Ekrem Konur says that Robert Firmino might be an option after ‘offering himself’ to the Red Devils
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United would have stiff competition for his signature, as Konur says Firmino has also offered himself to Arsenal, Inter Milan and Barcelona
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Firmino is out of contract this summer and failed to agree a new deal, so Liverpool will release him in the coming months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United need a centre-forward and would undoubtedly prefer one with Premier League experience and a good scoring record, so they could do a lot worse than Firmino
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The big issue is signing a Liverpool player, as the two bitter rivals seldom do business
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United haven’t signed or sold a player directly from or to Liverpool this century, so Firmino may not be on their radar

                United have been linked with Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane and Napoli’s Victor Omishen, but transfer expert Ekrem Konur says that Robert Firmino might be an option after ‘offering himself’ to the Red Devils
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United would have stiff competition for his signature, as Konur says Firmino has also offered himself to Arsenal, Inter Milan and Barcelona
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Firmino is out of contract this summer and failed to agree a new deal, so Liverpool will release him in the coming months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United need a centre-forward and would undoubtedly prefer one with Premier League experience and a good scoring record, so they could do a lot worse than Firmino
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The big issue is signing a Liverpool player, as the two bitter rivals seldom do business
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United haven’t signed or sold a player directly from or to Liverpool this century, so Firmino may not be on their radar
            </p>

                United have been linked with Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane and Napoli’s Victor Omishen, but transfer expert Ekrem Konur says that Robert Firmino might be an option after ‘offering himself’ to the Red Devils

            <p>
                Augsburg recovered after the break and pulled a goal back with Berisha's penalty on the hour but unmarked Alphonso Davies tapped in at the far post to make it 5-2 and restore Bayern's three-goal lead

                Champions Bayern Munich bounced back from a goal down and struck four times in a powerful first half against Augsburgen route to a 5-3 victory in the Bavarian derby on Saturday to go two points clear at the top of the Bundesliga

                Joao Cancelo's 15th-minute shot cancelled out Augsburg's lead and Bayern struck three more times until the break with defender Benjamin Pavard netting twice and Leroy Sane heading in their fourth goal from close range on the stroke of half-time

            <p>
                Augsburg recovered after the break and pulled a goal back with Berisha's penalty on the hour but unmarked Alphonso Davies tapped in at the far post to make it 5-2 and restore Bayern's three-goal lead

                Real Madrid fought back from a goal down to claim a 3-1 victory over Espanyol at the Bernabeu on Saturday, as the hosts returned to winning ways ahead of a potentially season-defining week in which they face Liverpool and Barcelona

            <p>
                It's the start of a very important week, with the Champions League and the Clasico," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told Movistar Plus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asensio smashed in a third in added time to wrap up the win for Madrid , who had dropped points in draws with rivals Atletico Madrid and Real Betis in their last two league games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "They caught us out a bit with the goal," Madrid defender Nacho said postmatch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Raphinha's goal decided another 1-0 win for Barcelona, who have earned a historic number of clean sheets in LaLiga (with some help from VAR)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcelona winger Raphinha secured a 1-0 win in LaLiga for the second straight week to beat Athletic Club and maintain a nine-point lead over Madrid

                A team of Chinese researchers funded by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) recently claimed to have used artificial intelligence (AI) to design an electrical layout of a warship with 100 percent accuracy and at an unprecedented speed

            <p>

                Firstly, the team notes in the paper that there is no room for error in warship design, and the AI chip designer can make a few mistakes

                Thick smoke rises during an eruption from Mount Merapi, Indonesia’s most active volcano, as seen from Tunggularum village in Sleman on Mar 11, 2023

            <p>
                Anwar said that the issue of Perak supplying raw water to Penang was still under discussion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said that any government, no matter PH or BN, would have to face the fact that the raw water supply in Perak is only enough for internal use
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On top of that, we are going to develop Perak as an industrial state, which will require more water
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We do not want a problem where we supply water to others and we suffer a shortage,” he explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saarani also said that this is why the state stands firm in its decision to not supply raw water to other states.

                And with Wout Weghorst failing to score in seven league games since joining on loan in January, it’s little wonder Ten Hag is ‘in the front row’ to sign the Serbian striker this summer

                The 23-year-old has eight goals from 16 Serie A games this season but has failed to score in six of his last seven league outings, so his future in Turin could be uncertain

                And Liverpool have encountered several already this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If last Sunday's record-breaking 7-0 win over Manchester United was regarded as such by the Reds boss, it was a similar story for the visit of Bournemouth back in August when his side equalled the highest win in Premier League history with a 9-0 triumph
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a similar story when Liverpool defeated Southampton 7-1 in 1999, when the next league meeting between the teams saw the Saints win 2-1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The overall record came way back in 1896 when Liverpool, then in the second division, followed a 5-0 win at Rotherham with a 10-1 home triumph against the Yorkshire side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He knows rock-bottom Bournemouth will want a freak win of their own

            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Liverpool have encountered several already this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If last Sunday's record-breaking 7-0 win over Manchester United was regarded as such by the Reds boss, it was a similar story for the visit of Bournemouth back in August when his side equalled the highest win in Premier League history with a 9-0 triumph
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a similar story when Liverpool defeated Southampton 7-1 in 1999, when the next league meeting between the teams saw the Saints win 2-1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The overall record came way back in 1896 when Liverpool, then in the second division, followed a 5-0 win at Rotherham with a 10-1 home triumph against the Yorkshire side
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, March 11 ― Former England football captain Gary Lineker has been taken off air by the BBC after his comments on Britain's migration policy sparked a furious row between the government and the corporation's highest paid presenter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lineker was told there has to be an agreed position on his use of social media before he can return, the BBC said yesterday, with Director General Tim Davie saying it had taken a “proportionate action”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The row overshadowed a migration deal struck between British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron, with the BBC accused of bowing to political pressure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Gary Lineker off air is an assault on free speech in the face of political pressure,” the opposition Labour party said, calling for the BBC to re-think its decision

                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim told the Dewan Rakyat on Thursday that he agreed with the criticism Johari had raised on Malaysia’s settlement deal with Goldman Sachs on 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last week, Johari said the government should review its deal with Goldman Sachs for its role in the scandal as the final sum was “too low”

            <p>
                “Goldman Sachs profited off our hardship and pain.” Goldman Sachs and the Malaysian government are currently in dispute over how much the US bank owes Malaysia for its role in raising US$6.5bil (RM29.4bil at present exchange rates) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The settlement announced by the previous government in July 2020 called for Goldman Sachs to pay US$2.5bil (RM11.3bil) while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4bil (RM6.33bil) of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the world, in exchange for Malaysia dropping charges against the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johari last week said the US$2.5bil figure agreed upon was too little, and Goldman Sachs should be made to pay the US$1.4bil sum outright
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “How can we allow Goldman Sachs just to run away like that when its senior management was involved?” Johari was the second finance minister during Najib ’s administration at the height of the 1MDB scandal

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 11 — The federal government is only expected to table in June the proposed amendment to enable foreign-born children of Malaysian mothers to automatically gain citizenship here, Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said has confirmed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Bill to amend the Constitution is expected to be tabled during the next sitting since there are some issues to be further deliberated, especially the issue of dual citizenship,” she said in a written response to Malay Mail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A Cabinet committee on the citizenship issue has been formed and is currently deliberating on issues pertaining to citizenship in preparation for the next sitting,” she said, when asked whether the Bill would be tabled in the year’s second meeting from June 12 to June 27 or the third that will go from October 9 to November 30
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Yes, it is needed by virtue of Article 159 of the Federal Constitution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on Azalina’s response, this would mean that the Cabinet committee will be finalising issues related to the Bill such as how the amended citizenship law would be implemented, with the government expected to present the finalised Bill to the Conference of Rulers for consent, before finally tabling the Bill in Parliament once royal consent is obtained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The proposed amendment would also result in Malaysian mothers being able to enjoy the same right — as guaranteed under Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution which disallows gender discrimination — to pass on their citizenship to their children born abroad, which Malaysian fathers currently already possess

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag should be looking at goalkeeping alternatives in the summer if the Dutch manager wants to upgrade his team and implement more control of the ball in defence

            <p>
                Dalot’s comfortability when receiving the ball at his feet or on the half term and his calmness of playing out from the back alongside his passing range and crossing ability was a key factor in Ten Hag’s decision to opt with Dalot over Wan-Bissaka
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During his time at United, he has often looked shaky when on the ball and lacking in terms of passing and crossing ability but since the World Cup break, he has had to step in for the injured Dalot and has looked like a new player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Dalot was substituted for Wan-Bissaka at half-time, United started to regain their control in the match thanks to the right-back’s quick one-touch passing and calmness on the ball
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While his finishing may not be up to the required standard for a club like United, the other facets of his game are exceptional and if Ten Hag decides to permanently sign him next season then he could become a vital squad player

                Dalot’s comfortability when receiving the ball at his feet or on the half term and his calmness of playing out from the back alongside his passing range and crossing ability was a key factor in Ten Hag’s decision to opt with Dalot over Wan-Bissaka

                About Us Advertise LONDON, March 11 — Alex Scott, the host of the BBC’s Football Focus TV programme in Britain, said it “does not feel right” to appear on the show on Saturday after the broadcaster took presenter Gary Lineker off air over his criticism of the government’s asylum policy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other presenters have also pulled out of BBC appearances after former England soccer captain Lineker, who presents the flagship Match of the Day soccer highlights programme, was taken off air by the BBC on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The row began after Lineker, the BBC’s highest-paid presenter, described new government legislation on migrants as a “cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s.” The BBC said there had to be an agreed position on Lineker’s use of social media before he could return to the broadcaster

                Man United cruised to a comfortable 4-1 victory over La Liga side Real Betis in the Europa League at Old Trafford on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United secured a convincing victory over the La Liga side at Old Trafford on Thursday night, with Erik ten Hag's side taking a commanding lead in the last-16 tie
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was an important victory for Ten Hag's men after a disappointing result at the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite this, Betis boss Pellegrini was adamant that his side would not give up despite their deficit heading into the second leg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I was curious about that and I was pleased by the response from the crowd to the team," Ten Hag said
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Man United cruised to a comfortable 4-1 victory over La Liga side Real Betis in the Europa League at Old Trafford on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United secured a convincing victory over the La Liga side at Old Trafford on Thursday night, with Erik ten Hag's side taking a commanding lead in the last-16 tie
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was an important victory for Ten Hag's men after a disappointing result at the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite this, Betis boss Pellegrini was adamant that his side would not give up despite their deficit heading into the second leg

            <p>
                "I was curious about that and I was pleased by the response from the crowd to the team," Ten Hag said

Recently, several Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia leaders cried foul and alleged they became the target of selective prosecution, politically motivated prosecution and persecution when they were hauled up in court for graft charges relating to the Jana Wibawa programme

            <p>
                The latest to do so was former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, who was charged on Friday (March 10) with six counts of abuse of power and two counts of money laundering while another charge is expected on Monday (March 13)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin introduced the Jana Wibawa programme during his tenure to give bumiputra contractors a boost during the Covid-19 lockdown

                After former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin was released on bail by the commission yesterday, he alleged that the MACC appeared to be acting on instructions from “above”
