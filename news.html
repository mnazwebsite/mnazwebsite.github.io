                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, April 14 — More than 30 per cent of current Covid-19 infections are reinfections, which is higher than the 20 to 25 per cent observed during the last infection wave, said Minister of Health Ong Ye Kung today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In such a situation, what drives our local waves is not imported infections, but re-infections of existing individuals in the community." S'pore experiencing another Covid-19 infection wave For the past month, Singapore has been in the middle of a Covid-19 infection wave but like all endemic disease, the Health Ministry no longer has "very granular data" on these infections, said Mr Ong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No dominant strain Mr Ong also said that there is currently no clear dominant strain of Covid-19 with multiple variants circulating in Singapore — XBB, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, BN.1, CH.1.1
            </p>

            <p>
                While the number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients has gone up, from 80 to 220 over the past month, this is still far below the peak of the pandemic, and also much lower than the number of patients hospitalised due to non-Covid-19 infections, said Mr Ong

            <p>

                Jonathan Chua Wei Cong was offered bail of S$15,000, and he intends to appeal against his conviction and sentence

                District Judge Brenda Tan had earlier convicted Jonathan Chua Wei Cong, 26, of the offences after a trial

                Chua had also shown a lack of remorse, said the DPP

                Before handing down the sentence on Thursday, Judge Tan said that probation was not a viable option

                In this video, Hafriz Shah takes you on a comprehensive tour of the carmaker’s latest SUV, which is positioned as a D-segment model above the C-segment X70
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first three – Standard, Executive and Premium – will come with seven seats arranged in a 2-3-2 layout, while the range-topping Flagship gets six seats in a 2-2-2 layout with second-row captain chairs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This makes it the biggest car in the line-up – the X70 is 4,519 mm long, 1,831 mm wide, 1,694 mm tall and its wheelbase is 2,670 mm by comparison
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for styling, the new Proton SUV looks a lot like the Haoyue, although the front is differentiated by the grille, which is described as an evolution of the Ethereal Bow and Infinite Weave elements we’ve seen on Proton models over the last few years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given this is a three-row SUV, interior space is important and the X90 offers sufficient legroom in the second- and third-row seats, although the latter are a little difficult to access as Hafriz points out and demonstrates in the video
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also goes over a lot of the features that are available for the X90, so if you want to pair what he says in the video to his thorough text article breaking down the details of Proton’s new SUV, give this video a watch

                Liverpool were made to rue not signing an alternative to Aurélien Tchouaméni last summer

            <p>
                Of course, the Merseysiders would opt to not sign an alternative permanent midfielder, only to go back on this call following a poor start to the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many observers had opined that Liverpool would require at least one top-class midfielder ahead of this current season, and the failure to do so now looks like a significant error on the part of Anfield's recruitment team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That said, his fee would still be significantly cheaper than what Liverpool was quoted for Bellingham, meaning the Reds could be able to sign two or three of their rumored targets this summer

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! From a Liverpool perspective, one must also factor in the decline of Fabinho's form over the course of this season, which will likely alarm Klopp quite considerably

            <p>
                Liverpool will regret not lining up an alternative for the French star last summer, but striking a deal to bring him to Merseyside would surely be the best way to draw a line under the woes of this season.

                About Us Advertise BANGKOK, April 14 — Water pistols, hose pipes and smiles were in abundance on the streets of Bangkok Thursday, as the city celebrated the Thai new year festival Songkran after a three-year pandemic-related hiatus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thai reveller Phoranee Sukjee, 29, said she was hopeful the revival of the festival would boost the country’s economy, which was battered by the pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Further along the road — lined with tubs offering refills — Julia Grinina laughed as her nine and eight-year-old children tore through the crowds, each armed with water guns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They allowed us to splash water, drink, eat, and they also relaxed the regulations so I think foreign tourists would enjoy this,” the 46-year-old added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since the 2021 coup, many have chosen not to celebrate the festival, with last year’s Thingyan marked by a heavy security presence on the streets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This year’s festival was also overshadowed by a junta air strike on a village in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region earlier in the week, which reportedly killed more than 100 people, including young children

                About Us Advertise BANGKOK, April 14 — Water pistols, hose pipes and smiles were in abundance on the streets of Bangkok Thursday, as the city celebrated the Thai new year festival Songkran after a three-year pandemic-related hiatus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thai reveller Phoranee Sukjee, 29, said she was hopeful the revival of the festival would boost the country’s economy, which was battered by the pandemic

            <p>
                Further along the road — lined with tubs offering refills — Julia Grinina laughed as her nine and eight-year-old children tore through the crowds, each armed with water guns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They allowed us to splash water, drink, eat, and they also relaxed the regulations so I think foreign tourists would enjoy this,” the 46-year-old added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since the 2021 coup, many have chosen not to celebrate the festival, with last year’s Thingyan marked by a heavy security presence on the streets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This year’s festival was also overshadowed by a junta air strike on a village in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region earlier in the week, which reportedly killed more than 100 people, including young children

                Palhinha has proven himself at Premier League level and will not come cheap
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That could prove too expensive for both Man Utd and Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As reported by The Sun, Man Utd have joined Liverpool in the race to sign Palhinha
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Man Utd do not have an option to buy the Bayern Munich star this summer

            <p>
                Liverpool might be a more likely destination for Palhinha, as their need for a central midfielder is more desperate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet it's unclear if they or Man Utd would be willing to pay £60m for Palhinha

                Shaquille O'Neal cannot be served a summons electronically for a class-action lawsuit brought against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and a host of celebrity spokespeople, a Florida judge ruled Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plaintiff's attorneys have unsuccessfully attempted to serve O'Neal in person for several months, court documents allege
            </p>
            
            <p>
                O'Neal is the only defendant in the class-action lawsuit who has not been served, attorneys alleged in a motion requesting permission to serve the "Inside the NBA" analyst electronically
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The motion claims that a process server has attempted to serve O'Neal dozens of times at both his Texas and Georgia residences, and via mail to both the residences and his offices in Atlanta, where "Inside the NBA" is broadcast from
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Attorneys allege that the last time the process server attempted to serve O'Neal in Texas, he "was sent an ominous and threatening text message by O'Neal or someone acting on his behalf." The message also claimed O'Neal lives in the Bahamas, which the law firm determined to be untrue, the motion states
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We take his veiled threats on our process server very seriously." As noted in the motion to serve O'Neal electronically, the four-time NBA champion has denied being involved in FTX beyond his sponsorship deal

                Shaquille O'Neal cannot be served a summons electronically for a class-action lawsuit brought against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and a host of celebrity spokespeople, a Florida judge ruled Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plaintiff's attorneys have unsuccessfully attempted to serve O'Neal in person for several months, court documents allege
            </p>
            
            <p>
                O'Neal is the only defendant in the class-action lawsuit who has not been served, attorneys alleged in a motion requesting permission to serve the "Inside the NBA" analyst electronically
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The motion claims that a process server has attempted to serve O'Neal dozens of times at both his Texas and Georgia residences, and via mail to both the residences and his offices in Atlanta, where "Inside the NBA" is broadcast from
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Attorneys allege that the last time the process server attempted to serve O'Neal in Texas, he "was sent an ominous and threatening text message by O'Neal or someone acting on his behalf." The message also claimed O'Neal lives in the Bahamas, which the law firm determined to be untrue, the motion states
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We take his veiled threats on our process server very seriously." As noted in the motion to serve O'Neal electronically, the four-time NBA champion has denied being involved in FTX beyond his sponsorship deal

                District Judge Brenda Tan had earlier convicted Jonathan Chua Wei Cong, 26, of the offences after a trial

                Chua had also shown a lack of remorse, said the DPP

            <p>
                Before handing down the sentence on Thursday, Judge Tan said that probation was not a viable option

            <p>
                She also noted that the mobile phone had recording capability and this was indicative of Chua’s intent to make a record of the victim

                District Judge Brenda Tan had earlier convicted Jonathan Chua Wei Cong, 26, of the offences after a trial

                Monster Dividend  From a pure income perspective, it’s hard to beat QYLD’s yield of 12%

                This double-digit yield is more than twice the rate of inflation, and it dwarfs the average yield of the S&P 500 and the yield of the ten-year treasury

                The Strategy Behind QYLD’s Double-Digit Yield After looking through QYLD’s top holdings, you might be noticing that outside of Pepsi and perhaps Broadcom, none of these names are really noted as dividend stocks (many don’t pay a dividend at all), and wondering how QYLD generates a double-digit yield from this basket of holdings

                About Us Advertise MIRI, April 13 — Cancer patient Lina Samuel has been issued with a temporary identification document following her meeting with the National Registration Department (JPN) in Lawas today, an indication that she could be getting back her MyKad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lina’s overjoyed daughter Ruran Lukas, when contacted, confirmed that her mother had been issued with the document that would serve as her identification pending further action from JPN and the Home Ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “During our meeting at JPN Lawas, we were told that my mother could be getting her MyKad soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, social activist Agnes Padan said that she was told that the temporary document could be used to travel (by air) if Lina needs to go to Miri for her next appointment with the specialist at Miri Hospital on April 17
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lina, a 65-year-old woman from Long Sebangang Lawas who was diagnosed with colon cancer in February this year, had her MyKad seized by JPN Lawas in Nov last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This has caused many problems for Lina, who had to worry about her difficulty to travel from Lawas to Miri Hospital for her treatment

                About Us Advertise MIRI, April 13 — Cancer patient Lina Samuel has been issued with a temporary identification document following her meeting with the National Registration Department (JPN) in Lawas today, an indication that she could be getting back her MyKad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lina’s overjoyed daughter Ruran Lukas, when contacted, confirmed that her mother had been issued with the document that would serve as her identification pending further action from JPN and the Home Ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “During our meeting at JPN Lawas, we were told that my mother could be getting her MyKad soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, social activist Agnes Padan said that she was told that the temporary document could be used to travel (by air) if Lina needs to go to Miri for her next appointment with the specialist at Miri Hospital on April 17
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lina, a 65-year-old woman from Long Sebangang Lawas who was diagnosed with colon cancer in February this year, had her MyKad seized by JPN Lawas in Nov last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This has caused many problems for Lina, who had to worry about her difficulty to travel from Lawas to Miri Hospital for her treatment

                About Us Advertise KAJANG, April 13 — Commuters departing from the new Kajang 2 Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) Komuter railway station will ride for free from tomorrow until Sunday, Transport Minister Anthony Loke announced today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The promotion will apply to all one-way trips from the new Kajang station to any connected KTM Komuter station, Loke said, including the one in his federal constituency of Seremban
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So, during the weekend before Raya you can use the KTM to go shopping,” he said in apparent jest at the press conference during the inauguration of the station
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The offer was meant to integrate the new Seremban Line station with the existing public transport system, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said there was a large pool of potential rail commuters within a five-kilometre radius of the station, which he hoped could be encouraged to use the rail service by making it easier to reach with bus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The station will also offer free parking facilities until April 21.

                It was reported that the arrest could be over the quota for recruiting foreign workers, which was under the purview of the Human Resources Ministry

                Such a statistic is hardly reassuring against a Crystal Palace side who have suddenly found their shooting boots, and Southampton could lose 10 Premier League home games in a single season for just the third time

            <p>
                Becoming the youngest player in Premier League history to set up three goals from open play in a single game, Olise pulled the strings as Palace fought back from Patrick Bamford's opener with a glut of goals from Jordan Ayew (2), Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Odsonne Edouard

            <p>
                Safety is far from assured for the Eagles, but there should be no concerns on the survival front if they can maintain their astounding attacking form, and Hodgson was the man in the dugout when Palace last won three Premier League games in a row in 2019-20

                Despite the termination, Hong Seng remained keen on the electrification revolution by choosing to focus on its electric vehicle (EV) batteries manufacturing project (Project Volt) in collaboration with EoCell Inc (USA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hong Seng had on Feb 13 announced its intention to acquire AEV for the purposes of acquiring the 55 acres Tanjung Malim Land held by AEV as well as AEV’s EV business which may complement its Project Volt initiative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The acquisition is subjected to conditions precedent of the SSA which included amongst others a feasibility study to be carried out by Hong Seng to assess the suitability of the Tanjung Malim Land for the purpose of Project Volt
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Riding on the positive global outlook of the global EV battery market, which is projected to reach US$134.6bil by 2027, the group remained committed to make Project Volt a success with much-needed support from the government

                “Malaysia bonds look attractive now that inflation has started to show signs of stabilisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For investors that hedge against the ringgit using three-month currency forwards, three-year government bonds offer a yield of nearly 6%, compared with around 3.3% without any hedging
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bank Negara Malaysia has kept monetary policy unchanged at its past two meetings, a sign its key rates may be around terminal levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Backing that view is the fact that headline inflation slowed to 3.7% from a year earlier in February, from as high as 4.7% in August.  Nonetheless, economists surveyed by Bloomberg are still expecting a final 25-basis-point rate hike to 3% based on their median forecasts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Bank Negara Malaysia does boost rates by another quarter point, shorter-end bonds will still have a buffer for investors that provide them more yield than the policy rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s three-year yields are nearly 60 basis points above the overnight policy rate, compared with an average gap of 25 basis points in the five years ending 2019 before the Covid pandemic roiled global markets

                General manager Tengku Ezan Ley Tengku Mahaleel said Lotus’ new journey in Malaysia will be complemented by the Lotus Emira, the production of which kicked off last year, and the all-new fully electric Lotus Eletre which is launched today in the Malaysian market and for the first time in Asia

                “Market share is not a concern at the moment as we want to reestablish the Lotus car brand again in Malaysia,” he told reporters after the launch of the Lotus Eletre here today

                In a press conference, the minister known as Tok Mat said that military service is also seen as less appealing due to other career paths that provide better financial compensation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So it’s not just due to one factor such as the retirement plan for military retirees,” he told the press at the ministry here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The minister was responding to Perikatan Nasional’s (PN) Ketereh MP Datuk Khlir Mohd Nor, a former major-general in the military, who said that an unclear career trajectory post-military service is one of the main reasons why non-Bumiputeras are uninterested to serve in the country’s military defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Khlir then urged the government to offer a better scheme for veterans who are desperate to have a better post-military service life
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, military personnel have options to retire after 12, 15 or 18 years of service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Mohamad told Parliament that less than 3 per cent of non-Bumiputeras have joined the military because of a lack of interest in the security personnel’s scope of work.

                United's top scorer pulled up in the 2-0 win over Everton on Saturday just minutes after setting Martial up for the second goal

                What will concern Ten Hag more whether Martial can complete 90 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We don't have to force things, we are careful," Ten Hag said of Martial's return on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The advantage was we could bring Martial back slowly, giving him minutes, but I think already against Everton he was ready to start the game." United's attack has been far more potent with a mobile No.9, whether that be Rashford pre-injury or Martial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if Ten Hag wants to maintain that dynamic then the United chief will have to rely on Martial for 90 minutes, something he has not managed all season

                United's top scorer pulled up in the 2-0 win over Everton on Saturday just minutes after setting Martial up for the second goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What will concern Ten Hag more whether Martial can complete 90 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We don't have to force things, we are careful," Ten Hag said of Martial's return on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The advantage was we could bring Martial back slowly, giving him minutes, but I think already against Everton he was ready to start the game." United's attack has been far more potent with a mobile No.9, whether that be Rashford pre-injury or Martial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if Ten Hag wants to maintain that dynamic then the United chief will have to rely on Martial for 90 minutes, something he has not managed all season

                National Instruments launched a formal sale process in January after Emerson threatened to challenge its board if it did not engage in deal negotiations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Emerson dropped its hostile bid once an auction for National Instruments got underway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bloomberg first reported about the talks advancing between Emerson and National Instruments on Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters first reported in March that Emerson, Fortive and Keysight were through to the final round of bidding for National Instruments, after breaking news of Emerson's interest in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal is expected to close in the first half of Emerson's fiscal 2024

                In a press conference, the minister known as Tok Mat said that military service is also seen as less appealing due to other career paths that provide better financial compensation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So it’s not just due to one factor such as the retirement plan for military retirees,” he told the press at the ministry here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The minister was responding to Perikatan Nasional’s (PN) Ketereh MP Datuk Khlir Mohd Nor, a former major-general in the military, who said that an unclear career trajectory post-military service is one of the main reasons why non-Bumiputeras are uninterested to serve in the country’s military defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Khlir then urged the government to offer a better scheme for veterans who are desperate to have a better post-military service life
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, military personnel have options to retire after 12, 15 or 18 years of service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Mohamad told Parliament that less than 3 per cent of non-Bumiputeras have joined the military because of a lack of interest in the security personnel’s scope of work.

                This doesn’t stop the German courts from taking note of the situation though, and with Vivo technically using Nokia’s patents without a license at the moment, the District Court of Mannheim has ruled that Vivo will be forced to halt all smartphone business in Germany until a licensing deal is achieved

                By encouraging older workers to remain in the workforce, the country could increase its overall labour force participation rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a report by the World Bank, a 1 per cent increase in the labour force participation rate in Malaysia could result in a 0.5 per cent increase in GDP per capita
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This suggests that individuals who work beyond the age of 60 may be able to accumulate additional retirement savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, if more individuals remain in the workforce past the age of 60, there may be a reduced need for social welfare programmes such as old age pensions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, there are also potential challenges associated with raising the retirement age
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Older workers may face age discrimination in the workplace, which could make it difficult for them to find or keep employment

            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a report by the World Bank, a 1 per cent increase in the labour force participation rate in Malaysia could result in a 0.5 per cent increase in GDP per capita
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This suggests that individuals who work beyond the age of 60 may be able to accumulate additional retirement savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, if more individuals remain in the workforce past the age of 60, there may be a reduced need for social welfare programmes such as old age pensions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, there are also potential challenges associated with raising the retirement age
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Older workers may face age discrimination in the workplace, which could make it difficult for them to find or keep employment

                Just moments ago, the Geely and Etika Automotive subsidiary officially unveiled its first full-electric SUV, the Lotus Eletre in our market

                At the same time, the new all-electric SUV is said to have the aero performance of Evija full-electric hypercar

            <p>
                Interestingly enough, Lotus Cars Malaysia is bringing all three variants of the Eletre into our market including the top of the range option, the Eletre R which can deliver 675kw (905hp) of output and 985Nm of torque

            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, the Eletre R maxes out at 490km according to WLTP standards but the standard Eletre and Eletre S can go as far as 600km

                A TV screen displays a warning message called "J-alert" after the Japanese government issued an alert, following a ballistic missile launch by North Korea, in this photo taken in Tokyo, Japan April 13, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We did not correct the information issued by the J-Alert" emergency broadcasting system, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the North Korean missile disappeared from Japan's radar immediately after detection, and a further analysis found that there was no possibility of its landing in Japan's territory, leading to the lifting of the evacuation warning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The J-Alert warning was issued to inform citizens of the danger of a falling missile to prioritise citizens' safety," Matsuno said

            <p>
                Though Umno is now a PH ally, Khairy said Anwar is being weighed down by his old friend Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi who is now the Malay nationalist party president and deputy prime minister

            <p>
                “Of greater concern to Anwar is if Umno becomes an electoral liability during the state polls,” Khairy wrote

                The former Health minister noted that Zahid has told Umno to formally petition the King for Najib’s pardon

                Khairy said that Anwar’s support may crumble if the PM fails to defend the judiciary against the ongoing smear campaign against the SRC trial judge who convicted Najib.

            <p>
                Varela is the kind of player who could be a significant reinforcement to Liverpool's midfield, as a squad player at the very least, and the Reds will struggle to find a player of his ilk available for around the same price in Europe

                In hindsight, not signing Fernández back then while he was still in Argentina was clearly a mistake both from Liverpool's and Chelsea's perspectives

                The Federal Constitution clearly stipulates that there are procedures in place that must be complied with by the government if it intends to strip anyone of their citizenship

            <p>
                “Thus, the individual retains their citizenship until and unless an order for its deprivation is made in compliance with the Constitution; yet her MyKad was taken away and her rights are now affected, most worrying of which is her right to get treatment for cancer at government hospitals

            <p>
                LFL director Zaid Malek in a statement yesterday said it was the woman’s right to have her MyKad, unless an order or deprivation of citizenship is made in compliance with the Federal Constitution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The seizure of the MyKad of an individual is without a doubt unlawful and unconstitutional act by the JPN to which there can be no justification,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It deprived the woman of her citizenship and her rights attached to it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Federal Constitution clearly stipulates that there are procedures in place that must be complied with by the government if it intends to strip anyone of their citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Thus, the individual retains their citizenship until and unless an order for its deprivation is made in compliance with the Constitution; yet her MyKad was taken away and her rights are now affected, most worrying of which is her right to get treatment for cancer at government hospitals

                He said this in response to the Attorney General’s objection against Zuraida’s legal action to be officially recognised as PBM president
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Legal representatives from the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) informed the High Court in Kuala Lumpur this morning that the objection was in line with ROS’s decision to recognise Sng as the party’s president
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She is also seeking a mandamus order to compel ROS to register and acknowledge her as PBM president, to take effect from Oct 7 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her application, Zuraida said that PBM had legally appointed her as the party president last Oct 7 and subsequently the ROS was informed of this on Oct 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zuraida and 10 others were sacked in December last year and this was followed by the announcement of the party’s new supreme council led by Sng as president in February this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In response to Zuraida seeking court intervention, Sng today reaffirmed that he is the legitimate president recognised by ROS, and any document indicating otherwise is a fake and the latter had also previously acknowledged him as party president

                The bond yield curve jumped and has maintained a high level, which means that the market is already discounting a fast pace of Fed rate hikes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, retirement savers shouldn’t worry too much about inflation affecting their fixed income investments in the medium term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The markets are discounting high inflation in the near term, but…an aggressive tightening cycle [by the Fed] will pull it lower in the longer term.” Although short-term inflation expectations are at the highest level since 1981, long-term inflation is expected to remain near 3%, a long-term average dating back to the 1990s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How Retirement Savers Can Take Advantage Given the market’s reaction to rising interest rates and expected inflation levels over the upcoming year, Charles Schwab asserts that the intermediate to long-term bond outlook is positive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Investors can buy intermediate- and long-term bonds through bond funds, which typically offer higher yields for longer bond terms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A combination of rising bond yields and planned interest rate hikes points to a relatively-advantageous entry point for intermediate- and long-term bond investing, which can help investors boost their retirement savings and income over time

                About Us Advertise   ALOR SETAR, April 12 ― Kedah Menteri Besar (MB) Datuk Seri Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor has been urged to learn from his counterparts in Perlis and Kelantan, who are more prudent in maintaining a good rapport with the federal government

                According to Mahfuz, any tension between the Kedah government and the federal government could also cause worries among the existing or future investors in the state

            <p>
                He said Muhammad Sanusi should leverage his position as the state government leader to explain to the public his vision and mission to develop Kedah and not make allegations or create political sentiments for his own benefit

                In this regard, Mahfuz urged the MB to heed the recent decree of the Sultan of Kedah Al-Aminul Karim Sultan Sallehuddin Sultan Badlishah on the importance of having a harmonious relationship with the federal government
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Azalina today said the Sulu claimants — who are seeking to enforce a US$14.9 billion (RM63 billion) arbitration award against Malaysia — are threatening the country’s sovereignty and security by making false statements that twist history and have harmed Malaysia’s image
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Sulu claimants are currently seeking to seize Malaysia’s assets abroad and to threaten Malaysia into paying the RM63 billion arbitration award — the second-largest arbitration award in history, but Azalina said Malaysia views the arbitration to be invalid and also does not recognise the Sulu claimants to be the valid descendants of the Sulu sultan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from continuing to take legal action to defend Malaysia from the Sulu claimants’ actions, the new website will help fight the false claims by the Sulu claimants, she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the launch today, Zambry said the Cabinet had decided that the three ministries would work together as a team and to assist Azalina in the work in defending Malaysia’s sovereignty in relation to the Sulu claim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any of our work whether internally or internationally, we will work together as a team,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Azalina said that this means the Sulu claimants are ignoring the people of Sabah’s exercise of their right to self-determination to be part of Malaysia.

                The Sulu claimants are currently seeking to seize Malaysia’s assets abroad and to threaten Malaysia into paying the RM63 billion arbitration award — the second-largest arbitration award in history, but Azalina said Malaysia views the arbitration to be invalid and also does not recognise the Sulu claimants to be the valid descendants of the Sulu sultan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from continuing to take legal action to defend Malaysia from the Sulu claimants’ actions, the new website will help fight the false claims by the Sulu claimants, she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the launch today, Zambry said the Cabinet had decided that the three ministries would work together as a team and to assist Azalina in the work in defending Malaysia’s sovereignty in relation to the Sulu claim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any of our work whether internally or internationally, we will work together as a team,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Azalina said that this means the Sulu claimants are ignoring the people of Sabah’s exercise of their right to self-determination to be part of Malaysia.

                According to the charge sheet, Azlan is accused of transferring four cheques — RM208,339.90, RM196,651, RM224,404.40 and RM222,811.95 — believed to be proceeds from unlawful activities from Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd and Sri Kedawang Travel & Tours (W) Sdn Bhd to two bank accounts he owned at a Maybank and CIMB branch in KL and Putrajaya respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was also accused of receiving RM207,468 in cash believed to be proceeds from unlawful activities from a representative of Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd at the Sheraton Imperial Hotel Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was charged under Section 4(1)(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act and is liable to be punished under Section 4(1) of the same act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On April 10, Azlan was charged with five counts of submitting false overseas travel claims worth more than RM1.18 million between 2013 and 2017 at the Sessions Court in Kangar, Perlis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The documents included invoices and quotations for return air tickets and hotel accommodation issued by Sri Kedawang Travel & Tours (W) Sdn Bhd and Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd, and Perlis state government order form AM 75E which were allegedly used for making claims for air tickets, hotel accommodation and transport
            </p>
            
            <p>

                According to the charge sheet, Azlan is accused of transferring four cheques — RM208,339.90, RM196,651, RM224,404.40 and RM222,811.95 — believed to be proceeds from unlawful activities from Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd and Sri Kedawang Travel & Tours (W) Sdn Bhd to two bank accounts he owned at a Maybank and CIMB branch in KL and Putrajaya respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was also accused of receiving RM207,468 in cash believed to be proceeds from unlawful activities from a representative of Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd at the Sheraton Imperial Hotel Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was charged under Section 4(1)(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act and is liable to be punished under Section 4(1) of the same act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On April 10, Azlan was charged with five counts of submitting false overseas travel claims worth more than RM1.18 million between 2013 and 2017 at the Sessions Court in Kangar, Perlis
            </p>

                The documents included invoices and quotations for return air tickets and hotel accommodation issued by Sri Kedawang Travel & Tours (W) Sdn Bhd and Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd, and Perlis state government order form AM 75E which were allegedly used for making claims for air tickets, hotel accommodation and transport

                For the Chinese, spring is an auspicious time and for the Malaysia-China bilateral relations, it symbolised the beginning of a new chapter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a nutshell, Anwar’s three-day visit which coincided with the 10th anniversary of the establishment of Malaysia-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership was a great success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is worth noting that the visit was highly significant right from the start in Hainan, where in his speech at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2023 (BFA 2023) Anwar joined other ASEAN leaders in voicing concerns over spillover effects of the US-China rivalry The high profile visit also provided Anwar the opportunity to clarify claims of his “pro China stand” and emphasise the need to continue the dialogue with China over South China Sea.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Malaysia does not see China as a competitor nor as an outright threat, hence Malaysia is happy to be a good neighbour, a friend and to benefit from the success of the strong relations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also pointed to China that Malaysia will continue pursuing oil and gas exploration in its area in the contested sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The visit augured well for the longstanding bilateral relationship, as Malaysia and China get ready to celebrate the golden anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 2024

                For the Chinese, spring is an auspicious time and for the Malaysia-China bilateral relations, it symbolised the beginning of a new chapter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a nutshell, Anwar’s three-day visit which coincided with the 10th anniversary of the establishment of Malaysia-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership was a great success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is worth noting that the visit was highly significant right from the start in Hainan, where in his speech at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2023 (BFA 2023) Anwar joined other ASEAN leaders in voicing concerns over spillover effects of the US-China rivalry The high profile visit also provided Anwar the opportunity to clarify claims of his “pro China stand” and emphasise the need to continue the dialogue with China over South China Sea.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Malaysia does not see China as a competitor nor as an outright threat, hence Malaysia is happy to be a good neighbour, a friend and to benefit from the success of the strong relations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also pointed to China that Malaysia will continue pursuing oil and gas exploration in its area in the contested sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The visit augured well for the longstanding bilateral relationship, as Malaysia and China get ready to celebrate the golden anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 2024

                The French president sowed confusion across the international community -- and left Western allies bristling -- after calling for "strategic autonomy" on Taiwan following last week's trip to China, where he met with President Xi Jinping

            <p>
                Fabinho has been one of Liverpool's worst-performing players this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nevertheless, Klopp's usual 4-3-3 looks likely to benefit him more than his new-look 3-2-5
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He's typically expected to perform as Liverpool's controller
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, his duties could change slightly in the 3-2-5 formation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He certainly has the skills to cope, but the Spanish international is undeniably at his best when he's Liverpool's fulcrum.

                It's an incredible result, but we have to do our game with huge, huge personality." After Rodri had put City ahead with a stunning strike from outside the penalty area, City took advantage of a Dayot Upamecano mistake to make it 2-0 when the French defender was robbed by Jack Grealish and Haaland crossed for Silva to head in
            </p>

            <p>
                I told the players, and they felt this does not feel like 3-0; but it is 3-0, and it's a huge, huge task to turn it around
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will not give up, and a home match in Germany is a home match in Germany, and it will not be over until we're in the shower."

                Craig Burley and Jan Aage Fjortoft explain what Man City's 3-0 win over Bayern Munich means for them and for Erling Haaland

            <p>
                It's an incredible result, but we have to do our game with huge, huge personality." After Rodri had put City ahead with a stunning strike from outside the penalty area, City took advantage of a Dayot Upamecano mistake to make it 2-0 when the French defender was robbed by Jack Grealish and Haaland crossed for Silva to head in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I won't allow the players to focus on the result," Tuchel said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I told the players, and they felt this does not feel like 3-0; but it is 3-0, and it's a huge, huge task to turn it around
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will not give up, and a home match in Germany is a home match in Germany, and it will not be over until we're in the shower."

                April 11 (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric (EMR.N) is in advanced talks to acquire National Instruments Corp (NATI.O) in a deal that could value the measurement equipment maker at about $8 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday

                National Instruments launched a formal sale process in January after Emerson threatened to challenge its board if it did not engage in deal negotiations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Emerson dropped its hostile bid once the auction for National Instruments got underway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters first reported in March that Emerson, Fortive and Keysight were through to the final round of bidding for National Instruments, after breaking news of Emerson's interest in January

                April 11 (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric (EMR.N) is in advanced talks to acquire National Instruments Corp (NATI.O) in a deal that could value the measurement equipment maker at about $8 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spokespeople for National Instruments, Emerson, Fortive and Keysight did not immediately respond to requests for comment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                National Instruments launched a formal sale process in January after Emerson threatened to challenge its board if it did not engage in deal negotiations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Emerson dropped its hostile bid once the auction for National Instruments got underway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters first reported in March that Emerson, Fortive and Keysight were through to the final round of bidding for National Instruments, after breaking news of Emerson's interest in January

                He said the amount was out of the RM14.1 billion received by the Accountant-General’s Department (JANM) from companies or firms in accordance with Section 8 of the Unclaimed Money Act (Act 370) from 1977 until last month

                Ahmad said WTD is defined as money that is legally payable to the owner but has remained unpaid for a period of not less than one year, money standing to the credit of an account that has not been operated in whatever manner by the owner for a period of not less than seven years and money to the credit of a trade account that has remained dormant for a period of not less than two years

                He urged owners of the unclaimed money to claim their money by submitting an application through the eGUMIS portal, at JANM counters nationwide or by mail sent directly to the WTD Putrajaya office

                About Us Advertise   ALOR SETAR, April 11 — Kedah Pakatan Harapan (PH) chairman Datuk Mahfuz Omar today lambasted Kedah Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor for claiming that there was a concerted effort to remove him as the state’s representative in the National Finance Council (NFC)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Muhammad Sanusi was reported by the media as claiming that there was an effort to name Kedah State Secretary Datuk Norizan Khazali as his successor in the NFC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Menteri Besar also claimed that the attempt to remove him from the NFC was due to his criticism of the Federal Government and alleged there were efforts to lobby the Sultan of Kedah Al Aminul Karim Sultan Sallehuddin Sultan Badlishah for that purpose
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In this regard, he said only the Sultan of Kedah can remove the Kedah Menteri Besar from being a member of the NFC, which in turn meant that Muhammad Sanusi’s allegation appears to degrade the ability and dignity of a Sultan

            <p>
                “This means the Sultan has absolute power to appoint anyone to represent Kedah in the National Finance Council
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, when he (Muhammad Sanusi) says there are parties lobbying the Sultan, he is degrading the Sultan, as though the Ruler is incapable of making his own decision on who should represent the state,” Mahfuz said

                Chelsea are the club that have taken a look at Real Madrid president Florentino Perez's near quarter century of "Galactico" policy (sign the best players, of any age; hire the best coaches; don't wait patiently for success before repeating the formula) and made a complete mess out of it

            <p>

                A Chinese warship takes part in a military drill off the Chinese coast near Fuzhou, Fujian Province, across from the Taiwan-controlled Matsu Islands, China, on April 11, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China launched three days of military exercises around self-ruled Taiwan on Saturday that saw it simulate targeted strikes and practise a blockade of the island
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taiwan's defence ministry said it had detected nine Chinese warships and 26 aircraft around the island as of 11am (0300 GMT) on Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Monday, the final day of the drills, the ministry said it had detected 12 Chinese warships and 91 aircraft around the island, with 54 planes crossing into Taiwan's southwestern and southeastern air defence identification zone (ADIZ)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ADIZ is not the same as Taiwan's territorial airspace, and includes a far greater area that overlaps with part of China's own ADIZ and even some of the mainland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen condemned the military drills on Monday, hours after they officially came to an end, saying China was using Taiwan's engagement with the United States as an "excuse to launch military exercises, causing instability in Taiwan and the region"

                Tupperware, which was once a staple in American kitchens, is warning that it might not have enough cash to survive in the near term

            <p>
                “Tupperware has embarked on a journey to turn around our operations and today marks a critical step in addressing our capital and liquidity position,” said Miguel Fernandez, president and chief executive officer of Tupperware Brands.  Tupperware, whose stock is down 68% year to date, is facing a possible delisting, it said, for failing to file an annual report

            <p>
                In 2020, however, Tupperware reported its first year-over-year sales increase since 2017

                Tupperware says it is working to improve its capital structure and near-term liquidity—and has brought on advisors to help it look for investors or potential partners

                In their decision on Tuesday, the Court of Appeal found that Ms Sam's conviction from the Johor Bahru High Court last year cannot stand since the charge was defective, Free Malaysia Today (FMT) reported
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Apr 18 last year, Ms Sam was released on bail pending the hearing of her appeal at the Court of Appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The panel allowed her application to stay the execution of the six-year jail sentence and RM6,000 (US$1,359) fine imposed by the Johor Bahru High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Bernama, the panel also allowed her application for leave to appeal against the decision of the High Court.  Prior to that, High Court judge Abu Bakar Katar - who meted out the jail sentence and fine on Ms Sam - on Apr 13 also ordered for her to be jailed for six months if she failed to pay the fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court judge handed down the decision after allowing the prosecution's appeal to set aside the Magistrate's Court's decision on Oct 10 2021 which acquitted and discharged the woman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ms Sam spent five days in jail after the judge refused her a stay of execution and bail pending her appeal to the Court of Appeal

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 — The women’s wing of MCA has today urged the police to also investigate the individuals who recorded a video of the young couple who were allegedly having sex in public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement, Wanita MCA National Chairman Wong You Fong said filming the couple with the intention to threaten, blackmail, or play a prank can also be considered a crime, especially when it involves a minor
            </p>

                BYD SD Motors Malaysia is selling two variants of the Atto 3, the Standard Range with a 49.92 kWh battery offering 410 km of range (NEDC, 345 km WLTP), and the Extended Range with a 60.48 kWh battery, rated for 480 km (NEDC, 420 km WLTP)

            <p>
                Entry it may be, but equipment wise, the Atto 3 SR is very well-stacked

            <p>
                So there you have it, the BYD Atto 3 Standard Range, which loses 70 km of range and a few luxuries for RM18k less

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, April 11 — Parti Bangsa Malaysia (PBM) president Datuk Larry Sng today claimed that a letter that purportedly recognises former Ampang MP Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin as the party president is a fake document

                He was responding to Zuraida’s judicial review application at the High Court against the Registrar of Societies (RoS) to declare that she is the rightful PBM president and to overturn the regulatory body’s declaration of Sng as the party president

            <p>
                In her court filing, she said that she was legally appointed by PBM as its president on October 7 last year and that the RoS was notified through a letter dated October 27 the same year

            <p>
                This is a fight we can win, together." Smith's coaching team consists of former England and Chelsea captain John Terry

                One player who is of interest to both Man Utd and Liverpool is Juventus’ Adrien Rabiot

                It is claimed Rabiot is more likely to join Man Utd than rivals Liverpool later this year as Ten Hag is plotting an ‘offensive’ for the 28-year-old
            </p>

                This is a lot of money for one player to receive, but Rabiot could just be worth it

                The Brazilian international did well in his clash with Salah, but nevertheless, the perks of Liverpool's new-look 3-2-5 were obvious, with Bukayo Saka and Riyad Mahrez also benefiting from those same one-on-one opportunities for Arsenal and Manchester City as a consequence of their full-back partners drifting inside to open up passing lanes in their direction

                The latest development follows the October 2022 agreement between Citaglobal and Genetec to develop battery storage management systems to store and manage excess power from renewable energy (RE) generation.  “MYBESS caters to different industry verticals ⁠— from transport, manufacturing, energy supply and distribution, to telecommunications ⁠— especially in grid integration to manage intermittent RE resources, which remains a challenge,” according to Citaglobal Genetec BESS chairman Tan Sri Dr Mohamad Norza Zakaria.  “In short, this battery energy storage system solves many of our existing challenges in the distribution of power, storage, scalability and portability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When combined, the scalability and portability of the battery energy storage system solution, with an RE source such as solar, allow businesses and communities to get around challenges found within conventional electrification
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is a viable and cost-competitive product,” he said during the launch of the battery energy storage system at Genetec's EPIC Plant here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad Norza is also the executive chairman and president of Citaglobal, formerly known as WZ Satu Bhd.  Meanwhile, International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said MYBESS will help catalyse the local RE ecosystem and the decarbonisation of the country’s economy over the middle to longer term.  “In 2022, global RE capacity rose by 10%, while investment in the green energy transition amounted to a record US$1.1 trillion (RM4.86 trillion) nationwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Miti (the Ministry of International Trade and Industry), one priority under the new investment policy involves strengthening Malaysia’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) [agenda] adoption, in support of Malaysia’s net zero [emissions] target by 2050, and a key component of this is to rethink how we generate, distribute, store, supply and consume energy.  “MYBESS is not only a step to support Malaysia’s [future] RE security, but also an important opportunity to begin positioning Malaysia in high-technology industries, and higher in the global value chain,” the minister added.  Genetec founder and managing director Chin Kem Weng commented that he sees opportunities to supply the locally developed end-to-end battery energy storage system solution in neighbouring Asian countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will tap into the global region when we are ready," Chin elaborated.  The total investment in the battery energy storage system, however, was not disclosed.  At Tuesday’s noon break, shares in Citaglobal finished up three sen or 2.07% at RM1.48, giving it a market capitalisation of RM561.76 million

                When combined, the scalability and portability of the battery energy storage system solution, with an RE source such as solar, allow businesses and communities to get around challenges found within conventional electrification
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is a viable and cost-competitive product,” he said during the launch of the battery energy storage system at Genetec's EPIC Plant here

                Mohamad Norza is also the executive chairman and president of Citaglobal, formerly known as WZ Satu Bhd.  Meanwhile, International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said MYBESS will help catalyse the local RE ecosystem and the decarbonisation of the country’s economy over the middle to longer term.  “In 2022, global RE capacity rose by 10%, while investment in the green energy transition amounted to a record US$1.1 trillion (RM4.86 trillion) nationwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Miti (the Ministry of International Trade and Industry), one priority under the new investment policy involves strengthening Malaysia’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) [agenda] adoption, in support of Malaysia’s net zero [emissions] target by 2050, and a key component of this is to rethink how we generate, distribute, store, supply and consume energy.  “MYBESS is not only a step to support Malaysia’s [future] RE security, but also an important opportunity to begin positioning Malaysia in high-technology industries, and higher in the global value chain,” the minister added.  Genetec founder and managing director Chin Kem Weng commented that he sees opportunities to supply the locally developed end-to-end battery energy storage system solution in neighbouring Asian countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will tap into the global region when we are ready," Chin elaborated.  The total investment in the battery energy storage system, however, was not disclosed.  At Tuesday’s noon break, shares in Citaglobal finished up three sen or 2.07% at RM1.48, giving it a market capitalisation of RM561.76 million

                The suggested solution is to enable Local Access which will allow you to access your files from your Windows or MacOS computer if you’re connected to the same local network as the WD product
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After that, make sure Local Network Access is enabled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You’ll be asked to create an SMB username and password which is a different login and password that’s required if someone on your local network needs to access the drive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once that’s done, you should be able to access your drive from File Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac computers as the WD drive should appear as a network device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you try to access it, you will be asked to enter the SMB username and password which you’ve just created
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you’re using a My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo and SanDisk ibi, you can learn more about enabling local network access for your affected Western Digital product here

                The suggested solution is to enable Local Access which will allow you to access your files from your Windows or MacOS computer if you’re connected to the same local network as the WD product
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After that, make sure Local Network Access is enabled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You’ll be asked to create an SMB username and password which is a different login and password that’s required if someone on your local network needs to access the drive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once that’s done, you should be able to access your drive from File Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac computers as the WD drive should appear as a network device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you try to access it, you will be asked to enter the SMB username and password which you’ve just created
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you’re using a My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo and SanDisk ibi, you can learn more about enabling local network access for your affected Western Digital product here

                Maybe this is too trivial a matter for HSBC Bank Malaysia.  The central bank has been doing its part to combat the rising incidences of financial scams and fraud.  In October 2022, BNM had moved a number of initiatives to tighten the system, reminding commercial banks to institute measures to curb fraud and scams

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 — The prosecution in Syed Saddiq Abdul Rahman's criminal breach trust (CBT) and money laundering trial argued today that he was wrong for withdrawing large sums of money from Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia's youth wing Armada's bank accounts

                For the second charge, the accused is charged with misusing property for himself, namely RM120,000 from the Maybank Islamic Berhad account belonging to Armada Bumi Bersatu Enterprise (ABBE), by causing Rafiq to dispose of the money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the money he raised was all for campaigning and that they used the ABBE account as it was easier to use a registered account rather than a personal account

            <p>
                He also said that he had used his own money to the tune of nearly RM171,000 up front and would reimburse himself later from the fundraising money

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, April 10 — The expatriate permit application process will be shortened from 87 days to five working days beginning June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said companies that have good track record in terms of expatriate employment and compliance with the laws are eligible for the shortened application process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The permit application system will be upgraded and the application procedure simplified with the integration of data combined under one system compared to the previous four stages of the application process,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the application process for Planning Permission (KM) by the local authorities (PBT), Rafizi said Pemudah also agreed that it should be implemented with best practices so that it can be within a short time range of at least 58 days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Currently, we have a big gap between PBT in terms of the KM application process, some can reach 200 days

            <p>
                Pemudah’s decision today is for us to adopt an agile process, for us to bring the best practices from PBTs that can quickly process KM to other PBTs across the country,” he said

            <p>

                Chris Sutton has commented on one specific incident in Arsenal’s 2-2 draw against Liverpool this evening when linesman Constantine Hatzidakis appeared to elbow, Andy Robertson
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What should the punishment be?” Just Arsenal Opinion To be fair to the linesman he was not the instigator of the incident, that was Robertson and it does not look as straightforward as Sutton is making out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hatzidakis could easily say that he was pushing Robertson away after the Liverpool defender grabbed his arm

                Steve Nicol gives his take on the title race after Arsenal dropped points in a 2-2 draw with Liverpool at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal still have time, and one huge game at the Etihad on April 26, to swing the momentum back in their direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For all their progress this season and the exhilarating manner in which they have led the title race for most of the campaign, Arsenal still struggle against their main rivals when the pressure is on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet the results that could return to haunt Arsenal if they miss out on the title will be the 0-0 draw at home to Newcastle in January, the 3-1 defeat against City at the Emirates in February and Sunday's draw at Liverpool -- games when a win would have felt like more than simply three points
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will only know how good this Arsenal team are at the end of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The harsh reality, though, is that Arsenal could end the season with 94 points and still finish second
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That Arsenal must scale such heights is a testament to the strength of their rival

                Steve Nicol gives his take on the title race after Arsenal dropped points in a 2-2 draw with Liverpool at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal still have time, and one huge game at the Etihad on April 26, to swing the momentum back in their direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For all their progress this season and the exhilarating manner in which they have led the title race for most of the campaign, Arsenal still struggle against their main rivals when the pressure is on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet the results that could return to haunt Arsenal if they miss out on the title will be the 0-0 draw at home to Newcastle in January, the 3-1 defeat against City at the Emirates in February and Sunday's draw at Liverpool -- games when a win would have felt like more than simply three points
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will only know how good this Arsenal team are at the end of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The harsh reality, though, is that Arsenal could end the season with 94 points and still finish second
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That Arsenal must scale such heights is a testament to the strength of their rival
            </p>

                Liverpool and the Anfield crowd fought back though, with Mohamed Salah clawing one back before the break, but the Egyptian was found wanting once again from the penalty spot as he spurned a golden opportunity to bring his side level in the second half

                Alexander-Arnold experiment Liverpool certainly didn’t help itself in the opening minute of the game, with a nervy opening touch from Ibrahima Konaté resulting in a free-kick, from which Martinelli sent an early warning before Xhaka saw his shot blocked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alisson bites back There’s no denying that Alisson has been Liverpool’s player of the season, and by a comfortable margin

Arteta’s Anfield ‘plan’ For all of Arsenal’s dominance in the first half, there was still a clear way back into the game for Liverpool, and there was a genuine argument that they could — and perhaps should — have been at least level at the break
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It certainly seemed to be working until Xhaka targeted Alexander-Arnold with a late challenge, leading to the Liverpool full-back geeing the crowd up and lifting his side in the process, leading to Salah’s lifeline

                Samsung Electronics might be hitting the panic button right now, as it has announced that it will be making a ‘meaning’ cut to its chip production
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a preliminary earnings statement, Samsung notes that its operating profit during the January 2023 to March 2023 timeframe is down to just 600 billion Korean won (RM2 billion)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s a sharp contrast from the 14.12 trillion Korean won it earned during the same period last year, with this year’s first quarter also being Samsung’s lowest profit for any quarter in the last 14 years
            </p>

                Datuk Mohammad Agus Yusoff, director-general of the Community Communication Department (J-Kom) in the Prime Minister’s Department, was responding to a recent YouTuber who accused Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim of selling out Malaysia to China over overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Opposition had manipulated Anwar’s April 4 statement on negotiations with China on oil explorations in an area of the South China Sea that has been subjected to overlapping territorial claims by various nations in an attempt to discredit the prime minister’s leadership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The PM’s statement was not to recognise the ZEE as China-owned but to defend the area as Malaysia’s territory at the negotiation table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PM voiced the matter to China after China also stated it was claiming the same area,” Agus said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China is claiming almost the entire South China Sea as its territory via its controversial “nine-dash line” on its maps, which cuts into the ZEE area of not only Malaysia but ogther South-east Asian countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Brunei
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s state oil company Petronas operates oil and gas fields within the 200-nautical mile ZEE area and has in recent years had several encounters with Chinese vessels at sea.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 — Any reports of political parties within the unity government giving up seats to allies for the upcoming state elections is “speculative at best”, as discussions within the unity government are still ongoing, Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil said today

                A Tesla owner sued the company on Friday in a prospective class action lawsuit, accusing Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker of violating customers’ privacy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawsuit follows a Reuters report that some Tesla employees allegedly shared sensitive images and videos recorded by the vehicles, including ones from inside customers’ garages—and even one of a naked man approaching a vehicle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fortune reached out to Tesla outside normal business hours but received no immediate reply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yeh was outraged at the idea that Tesla's cameras can be used to violate his family's privacy, which the California Constitution scrupulously protects.” The lawsuit alleges Tesla employees could access highly invasive images for their “tortious entertainment" and "the humiliation of those surreptitiously recorded." Yeh was filing the complaint "against Tesla on behalf of himself, similarly-situated class members, and the general public." Tesla equips its vehicles with an impressive array of cameras that can be helpful in a number of ways, such as proving who was at fault in an accident and helping with features such as Autopilot and Autopark
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this year Tesla agreed to change camera settings on vehicles sold in the European Union after a Dutch privacy regulator stated the previous settings allowed privacy violations

            <p>
                David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, told Reuters that, in the U.S., Tesla employees sharing sensitive videos could be deemed a violation of the company’s privacy policy and trigger intervention by the privacy regulator Federal Trade Commission

                If you've ever been interested in what's called "bucket strategy," you're in luck – Morningstar has put together three specific examples of bucket strategy for you to check out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you plan for retirement and manage your portfolio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bucket Strategy Basics If you're not familiar with bucket strategy, it calls for structuring your retirement assets in three buckets based on longevity and when cash is needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first bucket holds your cash, cash equivalents and other liquid assets designed to be used in the first years of retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line The bucket strategy is an intuitive and relatively straightforward approach for spreading your assets across cash, bonds and stocks in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Morningstar has three model portfolio asset allocations you can use depending on your risk tolerance and how long you expect to live in retirement

                If you've ever been interested in what's called "bucket strategy," you're in luck – Morningstar has put together three specific examples of bucket strategy for you to check out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you plan for retirement and manage your portfolio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bucket Strategy Basics If you're not familiar with bucket strategy, it calls for structuring your retirement assets in three buckets based on longevity and when cash is needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first bucket holds your cash, cash equivalents and other liquid assets designed to be used in the first years of retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line The bucket strategy is an intuitive and relatively straightforward approach for spreading your assets across cash, bonds and stocks in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Morningstar has three model portfolio asset allocations you can use depending on your risk tolerance and how long you expect to live in retirement

                Taiwan’s defence ministry said that as of midday today, they had spotted 58 Chinese aircraft, including Su-30 fighters and H-6 bombers, as well as nine ships, around Taiwan

            <p>
                Easter is considered the most important day in the Christian calendar as Christians across the world gather at churches to celebrate Jesus' resurrection, which many see as a message of hope and optimism for the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joseph Vijayraj, 48, who attended the mass with his wife and three children said that he loved the festive feeling of Easter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Retiree Benjamin Ng, 64, said he loved the communal atmosphere of Easter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Since young, I have also always admired how so many people from different backgrounds can come together in solidarity for hope for the future," said Ng, who has been coming to the church for over 10 years with his wife.

                Easter is considered the most important day in the Christian calendar as Christians across the world gather at churches to celebrate Jesus' resurrection, which many see as a message of hope and optimism for the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joseph Vijayraj, 48, who attended the mass with his wife and three children said that he loved the festive feeling of Easter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Retiree Benjamin Ng, 64, said he loved the communal atmosphere of Easter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Since young, I have also always admired how so many people from different backgrounds can come together in solidarity for hope for the future," said Ng, who has been coming to the church for over 10 years with his wife.

                During a 1984 meeting at Nike headquarters, Vaccaro proposed devoting all the money that Nike had earmarked to recruit future NBA players to one man — rising sports star Jordan

                Nearly 40 years later, the Nike partnership with Jordan has grown into an empire, with US$5.1 billion (RM22.5 billion) in sales last year from the Beaverton, Oregon-based company’s Jordan Brand alone

            <p>
                and I bet my job that he would be the person,” says Vaccaro, now 83, whose position at Nike was, at the time, under threat

                He had a killer instinct,” Vaccaro says

                The imagery of Air Jordan, the brand created around the player, celebrated a charismatic athlete who was both cool yet fiercely competitive

                Manchester United have reportedly slapped a £50million price tag on midfielder Scott McTominay, amid interest from Newcastle United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                McTominay has racked up north of 200 appearances for his boyhood club United during his career
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, last season, he played 30 games in the Premier League, having played 32 times the season prior
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Were that to happen, it could be to the benefit of Newcastle
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Manchester United have reportedly slapped a £50million price tag on midfielder Scott McTominay, amid interest from Newcastle United

                McTominay has racked up north of 200 appearances for his boyhood club United during his career

            <p>
                Indeed, last season, he played 30 games in the Premier League, having played 32 times the season prior

                About Us Advertise   JOHOR BARU, April 8 — An 84-year-old man who suffered poisoning after eating puffer fish on March 25, was confirmed dead at Enche’ Besar Hajjah Khalsom Hospital, Kluang, this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                State health and unity committee chairman Ling Tian Soon said the victim was the spouse of an 83-year-old woman who died after they ate the fish at noon on the same day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Johor State Health Department (JKNJ) had already taken action when a report on the first case was received and conducted an investigation, identifying the suppliers, wholesalers and sellers involved in the puffer fish transaction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is understood that it was the first time that the couple, who lived at Jalan Sin Tiam Chamek in Kluang, had eaten puffer fish-based cuisine allegedly through a pre-order purchase from a seller through Facebook
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 28, Ling reportedly said that an elderly woman died on March 25, while her husband was warded in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), after both were poisoned after the puffer fish meal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following that, on March 29, Fisheries Dept director-general Datuk Adnan Hussain was reported to have advised the public to avoid eating puffer fish of unknown type because almost all types of puffer fish contain toxins that can cause poisoning if not prepared or cooked correctly

                PH secretary-general Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said this consensus was agreed upon during preliminary discussions recently on seat allocations by PH and BN for the state polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also present were Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Acryl Sani Abdullah Sani and Immigration director-general Datuk Ruslin Jusoh

                Saifuddin Nasution said this when asked about preparations and distribution of seats involving PH and BN ahead of the state elections in six states, namely Kedah, Penang, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Kelantan and Terengganu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It had been reported that all six states have agreed to dissolve their respective state assemblies in the final two weeks of June to pave the way for state elections to be held
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin Nasution said seat distribution discussions among PH parties were now ongoing at the state level based on decisions made by the PH secretariat

            <p>
                Saifuddin Nasution added that should any party want additional seats but could not reach an agreement at the state level, the matter would then be resolved by the PH central leadership

            <p>
                PH secretary-general Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said this consensus was agreed upon during preliminary discussions recently on seat allocations by PH and BN for the state polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also present were Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Acryl Sani Abdullah Sani and Immigration director-general Datuk Ruslin Jusoh
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin Nasution said this when asked about preparations and distribution of seats involving PH and BN ahead of the state elections in six states, namely Kedah, Penang, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Kelantan and Terengganu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It had been reported that all six states have agreed to dissolve their respective state assemblies in the final two weeks of June to pave the way for state elections to be held
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin Nasution said seat distribution discussions among PH parties were now ongoing at the state level based on decisions made by the PH secretariat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin Nasution added that should any party want additional seats but could not reach an agreement at the state level, the matter would then be resolved by the PH central leadership

            </p>
            
            <p>
                where there is congestion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of that number (2.8 million passports), 40 per cent have no plans (only for keepsake) to leave the country while the rest travel (overseas),” Saifuddin Nasution said here tonight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin who is also Pantai Jerejak state assemblyman said JIM will also introduce a pilot project to overcome congestion at the passport issuing offices which are always crowded by only opening online applications and subsequent passport collection because the rationale is that there is widespread internet coverage in the area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Saifuddin Nasution said the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) receives 395,000 complaints nationwide every month and police are doing their best to solve them while there is no question of turning down any complaint received
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We also do not overlook the usual complaints such as crime or index (serious) crime

                Despite appeals for restraint, violence has surged since Israeli police clashed with Palestinians inside Jerusalem's flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque on Wednesday, with Israel bombarding both Gaza and Lebanon in response to rocket fire by Palestinian militants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police identified the driver as a 45-year-old from the Arab town of Kfar Kassem in central Israel

            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was the heaviest rocket fire from Lebanon since Israel fought a 34-day war with Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in 2006 and the first time Israel has confirmed an attack on Lebanese territory since April 2022
