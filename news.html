                Anwar told Parliament late on Thursday (March 9) that he agreed with criticism Johari (BN-Titiwangsa) had raised on Malaysia’s settlement deal with Goldman Sachs on 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Goldman Sachs profited off our hardship and pain.” Goldman Sachs and the Malaysian government are currently in dispute over how much the US bank owes Malaysia for its role in raising $6.5bil (RM29.4bil at present exchange rates) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The settlement announced by the previous government in July 2020 called for Goldman Sachs to pay US$2.5bil (RM11.3bil) while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4bil (RM6.33bil) of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the world, in exchange for Malaysia dropping charges against the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Why should we sacrifice money that we can get from the number one investment bank in the world?” Johari said on Feb 27, to thumps of approval from fellow lawmakers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How can we allow Goldman Sachs just to run away like that when its senior management was involved?” Johari was the second finance minister during jailed former premier Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s administration at the height of the 1MDB scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He lost his parliamentary seat in 2018 but won it back in November’s general election, and has since raised the Goldman Sachs issue in Parliament and in interviews with local media

                In a statement yesterday, EPF said another factor was structural wage challenges, whereby 44% of EPF contributors earn less than RM2,000 and 81% of them have an income of less than RM5,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only 45% of the 4.81 million members in this age group made contributions in 2022, while the rest did not contribute at all last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other factor is that 59% of the 2.85 million members in this age group applied for Covid-19 related withdrawals and withdrew more than RM62bil in total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As at the end of December 2022, there were 4.81 million EPF members in the 40-54 age range, with 2.17 million of them being active members and the remaining 2.64 million being inactive members (defined as having made no contributions in the past year)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                EPF, meanwhile, welcomes the government’s move to contribute RM500 on a one-time basis to the accounts of both active and inactive members to encourage more Malaysians to increase their retirement savings

            <p>
                Apart from Muhyiddin, the application was jointly filed by Datuk Kapt (R) Muhammad Suhaimi Yahya, who is the first applicant, in his capacity as a public officer of Bersatu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They named MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki, MACC senior director of investigation Datuk Seri Hishamuddin Hashim, MACC anti-money laundering division director Datuk Mohamad Zamri Zainul Abidin, Immigration director-general Datuk Seri Khairul Dzaimee Daud, 13 MACC officers along with the MACC, the Immigration Department and the government as respondents

            <p>
                The 13 officers are MACC officers involved in the investigation against Bersatu and the execution of the freeze order

            <p>
                On Muhyiddin’s travel ban, the applicants sought a declaration that the ban, without any reasonable basis, is illegal and a violation of Articles 5, 8, 9 and 10 of the Federal Constitution
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Malaysia’s men’s singles hopeful Lee Zii Jia was a semi-finalist in the German Open last year but his world has changed much since then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zii Jia had just become an independent player before he competed at last year’s event in Mulheim and had also hired Indra Wijaya as his coach and Liew Daren as a sparring partner

            <p>
                Daren has now taken up the role as a part-time coach and Zii Jia’s current mission in the ongoing German Open is to regain his confidence and nothing else

            <p>
                Zii Jia, the top seed, started well with a 21-11, 21-5 win over qualifier Magnus Johannesen of Sweden in the first round on Wednesday
            </p>

                In his winding-up speech for the policy stage of Budget 2023, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said this, however, will only apply to those who are really struggling with their financial circumstances

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also stressed that it was unfair to make Malaysians keep dipping into their retirement savings when these have already been drawn down repeatedly during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying the government would instead look for alternatives to help
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar’s Budget 2023 sailed through the policy stage via a voice vote at the Dewan Rakyat today

                Parliament Speaker Datuk Seri Johari Abdul called the vote on the Supply Bill 2023 after a winding-up speech from Anwar, who is also the finance minister.

                In his winding-up speech for the policy stage of Budget 2023, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said this, however, will only apply to those who are really struggling with their financial circumstances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I welcome the opinions, but we must remember that EPF is meant as retirement savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the best,” Anwar, who is also finance minister, said in Parliament today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also stressed that it was unfair to make Malaysians keep dipping into their retirement savings when these have already been drawn down repeatedly during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying the government would instead look for alternatives to help
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar’s Budget 2023 sailed through the policy stage via a voice vote at the Dewan Rakyat today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Parliament Speaker Datuk Seri Johari Abdul called the vote on the Supply Bill 2023 after a winding-up speech from Anwar, who is also the finance minister.

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 — Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin reportedly said today the corruption charges laid against him by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) were trumped up to besmirch his reputation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that he will answer these charges in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am innocent and I will answer these charges in court,” he was quoted saying in Free Malaysia Today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier today, the MACC said it has arrested the former prime minister, despite earlier expectations that he would be released before he was charged with abuse and money laundering tomorrow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin is set to face several charges under Section 23 of the MACC Act and Section 4(1)b of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 — Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin reportedly said today the corruption charges laid against him by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) were trumped up to besmirch his reputation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that he will answer these charges in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am innocent and I will answer these charges in court,” he was quoted saying in Free Malaysia Today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier today, the MACC said it has arrested the former prime minister, despite earlier expectations that he would be released before he was charged with abuse and money laundering tomorrow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin is set to face several charges under Section 23 of the MACC Act and Section 4(1)b of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Separately, Section 4(1)b provides for money laundering offences where any person acquires and uses proceeds of unlawful activity
            </p>

                If there is any sign of weakness from Erik ten Hag's team, it might not just be fourth spot in the Premier League that Liverpool will be eyeing up; third might just be up for grabs as well, meaning Liverpool should be watching carefully.

                Parliament Speaker Datuk Seri Johari Abdul called the vote on the Supply Bill 2023 after a winding-up speech from Anwar, who is also the finance minister

            <p>
                Budget 2023 will allocate a total of RM388.1 billion, with RM289.1 billion for operating expenses, and RM99 billion for development spending, including RM2 billion for contingencies

                On December 20 last year, Anwar tabled a “mini-budget” through the Consolidated Fund (Expenditure Entering Account) Bill 2022 to give the government RM107.72 billion and ensure no services were disrupted until Budget 2023 was passed

                Spurs were knocked out of Europe's premier cup competition by AC Milan after failing to score in both legs as the Serie A club progressed 1-0 on aggregate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Richarlison, who was signed by Spurs in the close season in a deal worth 60 million pounds ($71.21 million), has found game time hard to come by under Conte and played only the last 20 minutes against Milan in the 0-0 draw at home

            <p>

                "There was no explanation again, let's see what he (Conte) will tell us on Thursday but I'm not silly, I'm a professional that works hard every day and I want to play." Richarlison netted three times for Brazil at the World Cup but has scored only two goals for Tottenham this season and the 25-year-old has yet to open his account for the club in the Premier League, where they are fourth

                What’s new with the Nissan Leaf 2023? In terms of the drivetrain and battery, the 2023 model remains unchanged from the pre-facelifted version

                Under the floor, the new Leaf for Malaysia still gets a 40kWh battery with a rated 311km maximum driving range (NEDC) on a single charge

            <p>
                Besides the new vibrant colours, the Nissan Leaf 2023 gets a full black aero front grille with an updated Nissan Logo, grey-accent diffuser, revised bumper and a new redesigned aero spoiler at the rear

            <p>
                On top of that, the Nissan Leaf still comes with a space-saver spare tyre underneath the boot, which can be a lifesaver

                During a press conference in Parliament today, Ahmad Zahid, who is also the deputy prime minister, denied the claim, saying that it was normal for Umno to address the concerns of two members about the party’s no-contest motion for its top two posts that was decided during the last Umno General Assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two complainants are challenging the motion presented at Umno General Assembly and the proposal was examined by a permanent chairman who follows all the rules of the general assembly and all clauses in the (party’s) constitution

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two days ago, Saifuddin said he had, using his power as the home minister under Section 70 of the Societies Act, decided to exempt Umno from complying with that Act’s Section 13(1)(c)(iv) in relation to the approved motion in the 2022 Umno general assembly to not have the top two posts contested, after the reference was made to Umno’s party constitution and its rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Section 70 states the home minister’s power to use his discretion to exempt any society registered under the Societies Act from all or any of the provisions of the Act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid said Umno’s secretary-general had received a letter from the Home Ministry to approve the no-contest motion for the top two posts and said it was sufficient to prove that the motion was legitimate, also insisting that the home minister has the final say.

                The party, through Messrs Chetan Jethwani & Company, filed a judicial review application in the High Court yesterday, claiming the decision by the enforcement agency was done in “bad faith”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to court documents sighted by Malay Mail, the plaintiffs — namely Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Datuk Muhammad Suhaimi Yahaya (Rtd) — want the court to revoke the freezing order issued by MACC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They named MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki, MACC investigation division senior director Datuk Seri Hishamuddin Hashim, MACC anti-money laundering division director Datuk Mohamad Zamri Zainul Abidin, Immigration director-general Datuk Seri Khairul Dzaimee Daud, 13 MACC officers, along with the MACC, the Immigration Department, and the Government as respondents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the application, the party wants the court to revoke the freeze order issued by the MACC since it claimed they were not given any prior notification from the agency before the order was executed around January this year
            </p>

            <p>
                Separately, the party also stated the Immigration Department had imposed a travel ban on Muhyiddin, attributing the order’s execution to both Anwar and Ahmad Zahid, which the party is challenging in court as well

                Erica Herman, who lived with the 15-time major winner at his Florida mansion until late 2022, filed the request in the Circuit Court of the 19th Judicial Circuit in Martin County, Florida
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Herman's case filings do not go into further details and there are no specific allegations against Woods
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in response to a question on the court filing which reads “Does this case involve allegations of sexual abuse?” Herman’s attorneys have checked the box marked “Yes”
            </p>

                But Ng has asked Brodie to sentence him to no jail time in the US, arguing that the six months he spent in a Malaysian prison before extradition to New York and four years of house arrest were punishment enough.  Agnifilo on Wednesday also argued that Ng deserves leniency because the Malaysian government “has been made whole” because he relinquished claims to US$35.1 million that it seized from his accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng and his former Goldman boss, Tim Leissner, were accused of conspiring with Malaysian financier Jho Low, the scheme’s alleged mastermind
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He will be sentenced in September but will likely get less time due to his cooperation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prosecutors say Leissner made US$73.4 million in the scheme.  Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak received US$756 million and Khadem al-Qubaisi, a former managing director of Abu Dhabi’s state-owned International Petroleum Investment Co, which guaranteed the 1MDB transactions, got US$472.8 million, a forensic accountant with the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified at Ng’s trial.  Goldman paid more than US$2.9 billion to US authorities and more than US$5 billion globally for its role in the scheme, with its Malaysian unit pleading guilty in the US to a single conspiracy charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The government already sent its message to the world about Goldman when it accepted its money for a deferred prosecution agreement,” Agnifilo wrote on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jeff Ifrah, a white collar defence lawyer and expert on federal sentencing guidelines, said Ng would have a tough time convincing the judge to sentence him to time served

                But Ng has asked Brodie to sentence him to no jail time in the US, arguing that the six months he spent in a Malaysian prison before extradition to New York and four years of house arrest were punishment enough.  Agnifilo on Wednesday also argued that Ng deserves leniency because the Malaysian government “has been made whole” because he relinquished claims to US$35.1 million that it seized from his accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng and his former Goldman boss, Tim Leissner, were accused of conspiring with Malaysian financier Jho Low, the scheme’s alleged mastermind
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He will be sentenced in September but will likely get less time due to his cooperation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prosecutors say Leissner made US$73.4 million in the scheme.  Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak received US$756 million and Khadem al-Qubaisi, a former managing director of Abu Dhabi’s state-owned International Petroleum Investment Co, which guaranteed the 1MDB transactions, got US$472.8 million, a forensic accountant with the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified at Ng’s trial.  Goldman paid more than US$2.9 billion to US authorities and more than US$5 billion globally for its role in the scheme, with its Malaysian unit pleading guilty in the US to a single conspiracy charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The government already sent its message to the world about Goldman when it accepted its money for a deferred prosecution agreement,” Agnifilo wrote on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jeff Ifrah, a white collar defence lawyer and expert on federal sentencing guidelines, said Ng would have a tough time convincing the judge to sentence him to time served

                The plan to split "Big Four" firm Ernst & Young (EY) has been “paused”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a March 9 article in Financial Times, the plan was halted after disagreements were made as to how much of the firm’s tax business should remain with its audit side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The split aimed to free EY’s consultants and a significant portion of its tax practice from the restrictions of independence regulations, which currently hinder them from providing advice to the company's audit clients
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The firm had also planned to spin off a large portion of its tax practice into a new group

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The split would have been put to vote by the 13,000 partners in EY although votes on the plan were delayed “repeatedly” as there were disagreements over the details of the split

                In terms of look, the user interface of iDrive 8.5 is pretty much identical to iDrive 9 and includes the QuickSelect design concept

                Even with the introduction of iDrive 9, BMW isn’t leaving behind cars equipped with the relatively new iDrive 8 that debuted in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In terms of look, the user interface of iDrive 8.5 is pretty much identical to iDrive 9 and includes the QuickSelect design concept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, certain features like a new app store (Customer Digital Ecosystem) will only be available with iDrive 9

                Speaking to StarBiz at a dinner hosted by StarBox Group Holdings Ltd, which is the first Malaysia-based company to list on the Nasdaq exchange in the United States with foreign private issuer status, he said AGP is exploring to discover more Malaysian companies with the potential to list on US exchanges

                Anthony Loke said that the project could go on as long as it is not government-funded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The minister, however, said that the government has yet to receive a complete proposal from any party

            <p>
                “A lot of parties are talking about the project, but we have not received any complete proposals

            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the project was put on hold in September 2018, with both sides agreeing to shelf the bilateral project worth RM110bil until Dec 31, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia and Singapore jointly announced the termination of the project on Jan 1, 2021, due to a lack of agreement on Malaysia’s proposed changes and the fact that the agreement had expired on Dec 31, 2020

                Anthony Loke said that the project could go on as long as it is not government-funded

                The minister, however, said that the government has yet to receive a complete proposal from any party

                Malaysia and Singapore jointly announced the termination of the project on Jan 1, 2021, due to a lack of agreement on Malaysia’s proposed changes and the fact that the agreement had expired on Dec 31, 2020

                welcome back! — and with the squad still in need of reinforcements at key positions, Liverpool are back in the transfer rumour section with a vengeance, linked with players left and right in the past few days

                Darwin’s former club, Benfica, were in action in the Champions League last night, demolishing Belgian upstarts 5-1, and according to reports, the Reds had scouts in attendance, just as they had when Núñez scored a brace against Barcelona back in September of 2021

                Fernandes has been heavily criticised for his lack of leadership and petulant behaviour during Sunday’s humiliating 7-0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It has led to calls in some quarters for Ten Hag to take the captaincy away from the player, who has been skipper for the majority of the season with Maguire unable to get into the side
            </p>

                Bruno Fernandes will continue to captain Manchester United despite criticism of his actions during Sunday's 7-0 loss to Liverpool The Portuguese midfielder did not react well to United's seven-goal hiding at Anfield Erik ten Hag said Fernandes will continue to lead the team, calling him an 'inspiration' ‘He’s an inspiration for the whole team, but no one is perfect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I have to learn and he will learn as well because he’s intelligent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘I’m really happy to have Bruno Fernandes in the team and I’m really happy that, if Harry is not on the pitch, he’s our captain.’ Sitting alongside his manager at a press conference ahead of tonight’s Europa League last-16 first leg against Real Betis at Old Trafford, Marcus Rashford also defended Fernandes’ conduct and claimed his team-mate was only acting out of desperation to win
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fernandes clutched his face when Ibrahima Konate caught the midfielder in the chest Ten Hag has entrusted Fernandes with the captain's armband often in Maguire's absence Fernandes has escaped punishment from the FA for pushing the linesman on Sunday ‘We made a mess on Sunday and have to deal with it

                After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the bank isn’t finished raising rates, one market expert has warned a crash could come in a matter of days

            <p>
                The withdrawal of capital from middle-class families has been "spectacular," McDonald argued, as the Fed continues its most aggressive rate hike campaign since the 1980s to crush decades-high inflation

                You're flat to down after two years, and now you're looking over at a money market fund or a one-year treasury, and you get $510,000 of interest risk-free when a year ago you were getting 70." The market crash trigger, he further predicted, will come from the S&P earnings missing estimates big time

                The euro-dollar exchange rate plunged over 12% last year, falling below parity in August
            </p>

                American home prices, inflation and the political climate may be contributing to buyers looking abroad

            <p>
                If you’re thinking of relocating to a different country, you could sell your home for a high price now and potentially score a lower price elsewhere

                You could look into financing through your local bank or foreign mortgage products — but Cutchin says these can be limited and could require a larger down payment than what you might see in the U.S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Laurent benefited from the exchange rate declining last year, Morgan Stanley foreign exchange strategists are predicting it to rise back to $1.15 by the end of 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You could consider speaking to a currency expert to lock in your rate before making an investment overseas — for example, Moneycorp allows clients to lock in an exchange rate for up to two years

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 – Several civil society groups, creative organisations and individuals have urged the government to not engage in a “witch hunt” over the Mentega Terbang movie

            <p>
                The signatories included Amnesty International Malaysia, singer-songwriter and academic Azmyl Yunor, the Association of Women Lawyers, writer and musician Brian Gomez, Beyond Borders, the Centre for Independent Journalism, arts practitioner Chi Too, writer and academic Faisal Tehrani, Five Arts Centre, Freedom Film Network, and GERAK (Malaysian Academic Workforce Movement)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement was in response to the federal police confirming on Monday an investigation into the locally produced Mentega Terbang movie over recent allegations of religious provocation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In today’s statement, the coalition also questioned the apparent lack of response by the authorities over the threats of physical violence and sexual harassment against the filmmakers and producers of Mentega Terbang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Released in 2021, the movie explores the similarities and expressions of the major religions in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following its release on the Viu streaming service last January, the movie was criticised by some members of the public including local singer Caprice as well as by Parti Bumiputera Perkasa Malaysia (Putra), which lodged a police report against it last week.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 — Home Minister Senator Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has defended his decision to exempt Umno from deregistration over its motion to prohibit contests for its top two posts during internal elections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dissatisfied with Saifuddin’s answer, Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan (Perikatan Nasional - Kota Baru) then asked the minister to verify a supposed letter from the Registrar of Societies (RoS) to Umno directing the party to take “corrective measure” over the motion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Opposition chief whip said the minister’s decision to exempt Umno could have broad ramifications for all parties in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Saifuddin said he had, using his power as the home minister under Section 70 of the Societies Act, decided to exempt Umno from complying with that Act’s Section 13(1)(c)(iv) in relation to the approved motion in the 2022 Umno general assembly to not have the top two posts contested, after the reference was made to Umno’s party constitution and its rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Section 70 states the home minister’s power to use his discretion to exempt any society registered under the Societies Act from all or any of the provisions of the Act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid said Umno’s secretary-general had received a letter from the Home Ministry to approve the no-contest motion for the top two posts and said it was sufficient to prove that the motion was legitimate, also insisting that the Home Minister has the final say.

                Liverpool supporters will have been lapping up stats and facts continually since their side dismantled Manchester United on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Way down the list of numerical minutiae was something related to Darwin Nunez’ first goal, the Reds’ second of the afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With his brace against United, Nunez has three headed goals in the Premier League, putting him joint-fourth in the standings for this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Nunez was one of only three players to score home and away against the Reds last season – more trivia for you – his goals were fierce finishes from his right foot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In league and Europe, he scored a headed goal every 434 minutes last season, yet his rate for the Reds (in all competitions) has improved to one every 380
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What makes this more interesting is that Nunez appears very efficient in this regard, when his general finishing has been questioned throughout his time with Liverpool

                Liverpool supporters will have been lapping up stats and facts continually since their side dismantled Manchester United on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Way down the list of numerical minutiae was something related to Darwin Nunez’ first goal, the Reds’ second of the afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With his brace against United, Nunez has three headed goals in the Premier League, putting him joint-fourth in the standings for this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Nunez was one of only three players to score home and away against the Reds last season – more trivia for you – his goals were fierce finishes from his right foot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In league and Europe, he scored a headed goal every 434 minutes last season, yet his rate for the Reds (in all competitions) has improved to one every 380
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What makes this more interesting is that Nunez appears very efficient in this regard, when his general finishing has been questioned throughout his time with Liverpool

                Malaysia said on Wednesday it will summon to court the descendants of a former sultan in a dispute involving three of the government's properties in Paris, following the heirs' efforts to enforce a US$15 billion (RM67 billion) arbitration award

            <p>
                The Filipino heirs of the last Sultan of Sulu won the award in a French arbitration court last year in a dispute over a colonial-era land agreement, which independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the descendants a token sum annually

            <p>
                Malaysia, which did not participate in the arbitration, maintains the process was illegal and has obtained a stay on the ruling in France

            <p>
                The dispute stems from an 1878 agreement that was signed between two European colonists and the Sultan of Sulu for use of his territory in present-day Malaysia

                Mr Sivakumar Packirisamy, president of the non-governmental organisation Green Earth Society in Johor, expressed concern that floodwaters have not receded in parts of the state, despite the weather being mostly sunny over the last couple of days.  He highlighted that in places like Batu Pahat for instance, the water level has actually increased, leading to more people being forced out of their homes.   “Flood mitigation measures along the rivers in Johor have to be improved

                On Monday, Johor chief minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi warned that in spite of good weather, residents of Batu Pahat needed to be wary as river water from Segamat was flowing south and causing water levels to rise in some areas.  Batu Pahat is the worst-hit district in Johor, with more than 27,000 people displaced.  Mr Ling Tian Soon, state assemblyman for Yong Peng, told CNA on Monday that a key reason why many areas of Batu Pahat were flooded was because of overflow from the Bekok River

                The question postulated that as China’s economy faces growing downward pressure, regional countries are finding it difficult to rely on the US for security guarantees, and on China for economic development
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He noted that leaders of regional countries have stated that ASEAN should not be a proxy for any party
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With China considering the US-led Indo-Pacific strategy as yet another attempt to suppress its rapid rise, the adoption and widespread usage by many ASEAN member states and ASEAN itself of Indo-Pacific lingo in security-related discourse is not viewed positively by Beijing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But perhaps that was not enough to assuage China, as ASEAN deigning to respond to the US Indo-Pacific strategy might be viewed as an affront
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, the US military presence in Southeast Asia should not be viewed from an exclusively US-versus-China perspective only
            </p>

                It also concerns intra-ASEAN dynamics, where the US military has a stabilising effect among a number of ASEAN countries which might otherwise see higher levels of enmity.  And this regional stabilising role is one which most ASEAN countries do not view China as being ready to assume, perhaps at least not until substantial progress has been made in addressing the South China Sea territorial disputes between China and ASEAN claimants

                The question postulated that as China’s economy faces growing downward pressure, regional countries are finding it difficult to rely on the US for security guarantees, and on China for economic development

                With China considering the US-led Indo-Pacific strategy as yet another attempt to suppress its rapid rise, the adoption and widespread usage by many ASEAN member states and ASEAN itself of Indo-Pacific lingo in security-related discourse is not viewed positively by Beijing

            <p>

                In addition, the US military presence in Southeast Asia should not be viewed from an exclusively US-versus-China perspective only

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There were two large one-off investments that happened in 2021 from Intel and China’s Risen Energy Co Ltd,” he told reporters during the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) media conference on Malaysia’s investment performance for 2022

            <p>
                Earlier in his speech, Tengku Zafrul said foreign direct investments (FDIs) accounted for 61.7% or RM163.3 billion of the total approved investments, while domestic direct investments (DDIs) contributed 38.3% or RM101.3 billion

                Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attends an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bangkok on Nov 18, 2022

            <p>
                Albanese said that his government wanted to diversify trade with India, Australia's sixth-largest trading partner, and will be leading a business delegation in the first visit by an Australian prime minister since 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That presents an incredible opportunity for Australia," Albanese said

            <p>
                Albanese will reach India later on Wednesday and will be there until Saturday

                Liverpool are expected to be in the market for reinforcements in defensive areas this summer

                One Bundesliga defender could follow in the footsteps of two current Reds stars

            <p>
                Ndicka has impressed for Frankfurt this season as his team sits sixth in the Bundesliga, with the imposing center-back winning on average 2.6 aerial duels, averaging 5.2 clearances and 0.7 blocks per Bundesliga appearance this season, according to statistics from WhoScored
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the case of Ndicka, it is clear that Liverpool would be getting another of the Bundesliga's emerging talents, just without having to massively impact the rest of its transfer budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given Ndicka's superior fitness record when compared with current back-up options Gomez and Matip — he has played 22 times for Frankfurt in the Bundesliga this season and turned out 34 times in the league last season — it would be fair to suggest that the former Auxerre defender may prove to be a more reliable option for Klopp

                On Saturday, Ahmad Zahid, at an Umno event in Penang, said the party had received a letter from the ministry confirming that ROS – which is under the Home Ministry’s purview – had accepted the party’s no-contest resolution for the top two posts

                Before that, Umno vice-president Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob had asked Ahmad Zahid to produce the ROS letter following the controversy over the additional motion passed at the party’s 2022 general assembly in January

                In years gone by, it would have felt wrong for a full-back to be classed as one of the Premier League's finest playmakers but in the case of one Liverpool star, the description could not be more apt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool was sensational against Manchester United at the weekend and a key driver in this performance was Andy Robertson
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, as promising as Liverpool's win over Manchester United undoubtedly was, the Reds' wider performance this season still suggests that changes will need to be made in the summer

                Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday interest rates are likely to rise more than previously expected as the central bank works to bring down inflation, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the Fed's February policy decision, the central bank's benchmark interest rate stands in a range of 4.5%-4.75%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed chair said Tuesday policymakers will continue to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis, and while Powell acknowledged the FOMC has slowed its pace of rate hikes he did not mention whether or not rate hikes would continue at that pace
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Powell noted that economic data from January on inflation, job growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing production have partly reversed course from the slowdown seen back in December
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He reiterated the Fed still needs to see a drop in services inflation excluding housing to bring inflation down, which is likely to require a weaker job market

                Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday interest rates are likely to rise more than previously expected as the central bank works to bring down inflation, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the Fed's February policy decision, the central bank's benchmark interest rate stands in a range of 4.5%-4.75%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed chair said Tuesday policymakers will continue to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis, and while Powell acknowledged the FOMC has slowed its pace of rate hikes he did not mention whether or not rate hikes would continue at that pace
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Powell noted that economic data from January on inflation, job growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing production have partly reversed course from the slowdown seen back in December
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He reiterated the Fed still needs to see a drop in services inflation excluding housing to bring inflation down, which is likely to require a weaker job market
            </p>

                Their demographic alone amassed nearly $4 trillion in debt in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to the Wall Street Journal's analysis of Federal Reserve Bank of New York data
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Millennials in their 30s have added over $3.8 trillion in debt to their accounts — and are missing their credit card and auto loan payments at startling rates as well, according to the New York Fed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Across all age groups in the survey, mortgage debt makes up the biggest share of outstanding balances — with that number rising by nearly $1 trillion last year, according to the New York Fed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you don’t pay your credit card bill on time, you risk harming your credit score and adding up on interest and late fees — exacerbating your existing debt and making it more difficult to pay off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aside from drivers in their 20s, this age group is also missing the most auto loan payments, says the New York Fed

                With a strong credit score, you could land a rate of between 6% to 8%

                Their demographic alone amassed nearly $4 trillion in debt in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to the Wall Street Journal's analysis of Federal Reserve Bank of New York data
            </p>

                Millennials in their 30s have added over $3.8 trillion in debt to their accounts — and are missing their credit card and auto loan payments at startling rates as well, according to the New York Fed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Across all age groups in the survey, mortgage debt makes up the biggest share of outstanding balances — with that number rising by nearly $1 trillion last year, according to the New York Fed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you don’t pay your credit card bill on time, you risk harming your credit score and adding up on interest and late fees — exacerbating your existing debt and making it more difficult to pay off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aside from drivers in their 20s, this age group is also missing the most auto loan payments, says the New York Fed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With a strong credit score, you could land a rate of between 6% to 8%

                Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said Najib is not allowed to use a laptop or access the internet while in Kajang Prison, but suggested that it was still possible for him to post social media posts through his social media team doing so on his behalf as long as they are able to access his social media accounts

            <p>
                Addressing over 100 diplomatic officers here on Tuesday (March 7), Anwar appeared unperturbed by PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang's claims of toppling the current government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abdul Hadi reportedly said that no parties would be able to stop Perikatan Nasional's plans to topple the government, saying that politics is dynamic and that such practice is considered normal in a democratic country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the session, Anwar said in order to bring the country to its past glory, Malaysians, including government officers, must not only uphold good governance but must be ready to make changes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We must do this and affect this change, which is extremely necessary to save this country from the mess that we have been in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar called on the heads of diplomatic missions to do better for the country, and it was vital for Malaysian officers and diplomats overseas to set an example of what it meant to be a good competent leader

            <p>
                Addressing over 100 diplomatic officers here on Tuesday (March 7), Anwar appeared unperturbed by PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang's claims of toppling the current government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abdul Hadi reportedly said that no parties would be able to stop Perikatan Nasional's plans to topple the government, saying that politics is dynamic and that such practice is considered normal in a democratic country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the session, Anwar said in order to bring the country to its past glory, Malaysians, including government officers, must not only uphold good governance but must be ready to make changes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We must do this and affect this change, which is extremely necessary to save this country from the mess that we have been in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar called on the heads of diplomatic missions to do better for the country, and it was vital for Malaysian officers and diplomats overseas to set an example of what it meant to be a good competent leader
            </p>

                Reported Liverpool target Mason Mount has turned down contract offers of almost £250k-a-week from Chelsea

            <p>
                However, claims that the 24-year-old is looking for closer to £300k-a-week have been dismissed as being ‘not true.’ Whatever Mount is demanding though, Chelsea are clearly yet to meet it

            <p>
                As per Spotrac, James currently takes home £250k-a-week at Chelsea

            <p>
                The fact that Mount has rejected similar is not particularly encouraging in terms of Liverpool’s pursuit of him

            <p>
                Clearly, there’s absolutely no way Liverpool would pay Mason Mount anything like what they’re paying their No.4, and nor should they

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Recently, a claim was made online that a third wave of flooding in Johor will be caused by dams releasing water to prevent instabilities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The release of water from the dams is being done according to standard operating procedures and no water is being pumped out using large pumps as claimed in the viral recording,” it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The department said that the public could refer to the publicinfobanjir.water.gov.my website for the latest information on the floods.

                As per the SGE specifications, the non-gold component should contain no more than 50 ppm silver, it said

                Kim Yo-jong (pic) said North Korea is monitoring the "restless military moves by the US forces” and its South Korean "puppet military,” adding Pyongyang is "on standby to take appropriate, quick and overwhelming action at any time according to our judgment,” the official Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday (March 7)
            </p>

                The latest comments indicate North Korea could ramp up provocations in conjunction with the drills, with Kim last month threatening to turn the Pacific Ocean into a "firing range” if they went ahead

                The last time North Korea launched a missile into the Pacific was October 2022, when it fired a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan, flying about of 4,600km (2,860 miles), and marking the longest distance traveled by a North Korean missile to date
            </p>

                The drills had been scaled down or halted under former President Donald Trump, who was hoping the move would facilitate his nuclear negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un

                Abby Choi was murdered and her body parts were found in a village house in Tai Po, Hong Kong, on Feb 24, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The suspect, a Hong Kong woman, was handed over to the Hong Kong police at a border control point on Tuesday (March 7), reported the South China Morning Post (SCMP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was the third person arrested for assisting an offender in this murder case, which was uncovered on Feb 24
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was released on bail without charge, but must report to the police later in March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kwong, 28, alongside his 65-year-old father Kwong Kau, 63-year-old mother Jenny Li and brother Anthony Kwong, 31, were charged in connection with the murder on Feb 27

                The 7-0 hammering of Manchester United will echo for decades but Jurgen Klopp's focus has now moved to Saturday lunchtime's trip to Bournemouth as they look to continue their push for the top four

                In midfield, there are strong claims for Stefan Bajcetic to return to the side after his encouraging cameo off the bench on Sunday but it would seem harsh to drop out any of the three who started on Sunday, with Harvey Elliott, in particular, turning in one of his best performances as a Liverpool player

                Roberto Firmino, who is entering the final months of his eight-year spell at Liverpool, did score from the bench against United, of course, but it seems likely that the Brazil international is likely to continue his role as deputy for now as the Reds head down south in a rich vein of form by this season's standards

                Although it does not hard-sell American hegemony, it implants such a concept into its system and tries to stir up disputes in China.” He says ChatGPT tends to give negative comments about China, for example by concluding that China is the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter without citing other reports that say the US is the biggest emitter

                SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Rivian Automotive plans to sell bonds worth $1.3 billion, it said on Monday, as weakening demand and lofty costs tighten a cash crunch around electrical vehicle makers
            </p>

                Shares in Rivian fell nearly 7% in after-hours trading

                The capital from this offering will help facilitate the launch of Rivian's smaller R2 vehicle family, a Rivian spokesperson told Reuters, adding that convertible debt was "optimal cost of capital versus selling equity at today's levels." Irvine, California-based Rivian, which makes R1T electric pickup trucks and R1S SUVs, has said its cash balance will fund its operations through 2025

                Late last year, it shelved plans to build delivery vans in Europe with Mercedes and had earlier pushed back by a year to 2026 the planned launch of a smaller R2 vehicle family at the $5 billion plant it is building in Georgia

                Last week, Mukhriz announced that the party has applied to join PN as a component party
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Analyst James Chin said Pejuang has no other option but to join PN as Pakatan Harapan will not accept them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The analysts believed that if PN were to accept Pejuang, however, it would be very low in the coalition’s hierarchy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Pejuang will definitely be a junior partner,” said Syaza
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azmi concurred and said Pejuang would be lower than even Gerakan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They can say they are a coalition that fights for the Malays and defend Islam,” Azmi said

                Liverpool have learned how much it will cost to sign James Maddison in the summer if he continues to reject Leicester City's attempts to renew his contract.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Football Insider, Liverpool will need to pay £60m-£70m to sign Maddison this summer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool's midfield is lacking a player like Maddison, who is a double threat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He can score and assist with equal efficiency and would give Jurgen Klopp a different attacking threat than what he currently has on offer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given the lack of a playmaker in Liverpool's traditional midfield three, it's difficult to predict how Klopp would use Maddison.

                Liverpool have learned how much it will cost to sign James Maddison in the summer if he continues to reject Leicester City's attempts to renew his contract.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Football Insider, Liverpool will need to pay £60m-£70m to sign Maddison this summer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool's midfield is lacking a player like Maddison, who is a double threat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He can score and assist with equal efficiency and would give Jurgen Klopp a different attacking threat than what he currently has on offer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given the lack of a playmaker in Liverpool's traditional midfield three, it's difficult to predict how Klopp would use Maddison.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                By netting his 128th and 129th league goals for Liverpool against United, Salah finally achieved his dream and, as implausible as it may first appear may have designs on catching the likes of Ian Rush and Roger Hunt — who scored 244 and 229 times, respectively — in terms of all-time league strikes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The key will be to ensure that the team is set up to play to Salah's key attributes, as was the case for Liverpool against United, with Gakpo and Núñez both pressing Erik ten Hag's defenders relentlessly out of possession while Salah intelligently stretched their backline with his skillful dribbling, clever movement and eye for a through pass while in possession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When Salah scored his second goal of the night to overtake Fowler as Liverpool's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League, it felt as though he had achieved what he had set out to when he first signed for the club in 2017

                Premier League • England Jamie Carragher has pointed the finger at Manchester United midfielder Casemiro for his role in their defeat to Liverpool on Sunday, despite him usually being “one of the best players in the league”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to ex-Liverpool defender Carragher, one of the main culprits was Casemiro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second goal is the killer for United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He didn’t win one tackle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is away at Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The same message should apply to Casemiro individually, since he has generally been an important player for Ten Hag this term

                Premier League • England Jamie Carragher has pointed the finger at Manchester United midfielder Casemiro for his role in their defeat to Liverpool on Sunday, despite him usually being “one of the best players in the league”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to ex-Liverpool defender Carragher, one of the main culprits was Casemiro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second goal is the killer for United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He didn’t win one tackle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is away at Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The same message should apply to Casemiro individually, since he has generally been an important player for Ten Hag this term
            </p>

                MANCHESTER UNITED reckon they can sign Harry Kane this summer, if Tottenham miss out on the top four

            <p>

                And with United having made contact with Kane's camp via a third party, they believe they can prise the England skipper from his boyhood club this summer

                Ten Hag, 53, could also try Rashford up top with Kane - but may have to experiment with a back three formation to do so

                Anwar, who was appointed Malaysia’s 10th prime minister after a fractious general election last November, acknowledged that investment talks with the two companies began in December 2019

            <p>
                “This is true, the talks between the government and AWS began in December 2019 and continued during the previous administrations,” he said during the Prime Minister’s Question Time in the Dewan Rakyat

                International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz previously said that the proposed investments by Tesla and AWS were expected to create high-quality job opportunities and invigorate Malaysia’s economy through a cascade effect post-Covid

                (Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson pivoted on the short-term outlook for US stocks, saying the rally may have room to run before earnings headwinds increase

                In his defence of the four assemblymen, Wan Saiful reminded that Penang’s former chief minister and DAP’s Bagan MP Lim Guan Eng, had on August 2022 said there was a need for the Penang state government to amend the State Constitution so that it is in line with the anti-party hopping law at federal level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “At the federal level, when an individual is sacked, or when a party leaves a coalition, that situation is not considered as party-hopping
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But the regulations in the Penang state government are not in-line with the aspirations at the federal level when two assemblymen in Penang from PN who never party-hopped, both contested under Bersatu, remained in Bersatu, but Bersatu left Pakatan Harapan (PH) and two more assemblymen were sacked from PKR, these two have never party-hopped as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The aspirations at the federal level have not been translated at the state level as the sacking and two more who remained in Bersatu has been considered as party-hopping in Penang,” he said expressing regret over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zulkifli and Dr Afif, who were both PKR members when they were elected, have since been sacked by the party while Khaliq and Zolkifly are still members of Bersatu, the same party they were part of during the 2018 state polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He cited Article 14A of the Penang Constitution, which stipulates that a member of the state legislative assembly shall vacate his seat if having been elected as a candidate of a political party, he resigns or is expelled from a party or having been elected otherwise than as a candidate of a political party, he joins a political party

                Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (pic) confirmed that he had not seen the letter from ROS regarding the approval of the additional motion of the Umno general assembly

            <p>
                On Saturday (March 4) Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said the party had received a letter from Saifuddin on Friday (March 3) regarding the ROS decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said on Sunday (March 5) that Umno will publish the letter from ROS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said he would ask the party’s secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan to see to this so that all members are reassured over the matter

            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid, who is also Rural and Regional Development Minister, said it is hoped that the ROS letter would bring to an end any polemic against the motion that was approved during the 2022 Umno general assembly in January this year

                seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane

            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane

                seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane

            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane

                The firm’s search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, A$200 million (US$135.36 million) underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane

                Craig Burley and Steve Nicol react to Real Madrid's 0-0 draw to Real Betis in LaLiga play
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Madrid have followed last week's stunning 5-2 win at Liverpool in the Champions League round-of-16 with a 1-1 league draw with Atletico Madrid -- youngster Alvaro Rodriguez scoring with a header from a corner -- a 1-0 home defeat to Barca in the Copa del Rey, and now Sunday's goalless draw at the Estadio Benito Villamarin

            <p>
                It's quite unusual for Madrid to score just one goal, from a set piece, in three games

            <p>
                That's the problem, being more efficient." Madrid had fifteen shots against Betis, five of them on target, but were unable to beat goalkeeper Claudio Bravo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It isn't an individual problem, it's a collective problem." Ancelotti also defended Madrid's squad planning, after leaving three forwards -- Marco Asensio, Mariano Diaz and Eden Hazard -- on the bench as unused substitutes in Seville, despite the team needing a goal

                Craig Burley and Steve Nicol react to Real Madrid's 0-0 draw to Real Betis in LaLiga play
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Madrid have followed last week's stunning 5-2 win at Liverpool in the Champions League round-of-16 with a 1-1 league draw with Atletico Madrid -- youngster Alvaro Rodriguez scoring with a header from a corner -- a 1-0 home defeat to Barca in the Copa del Rey, and now Sunday's goalless draw at the Estadio Benito Villamarin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's quite unusual for Madrid to score just one goal, from a set piece, in three games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's strange that this team with its quality can't score goals in three games, that's the reality, it affects me, the players are affected too, we can score goals, we always have
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's the problem, being more efficient." Madrid had fifteen shots against Betis, five of them on target, but were unable to beat goalkeeper Claudio Bravo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It isn't an individual problem, it's a collective problem." Ancelotti also defended Madrid's squad planning, after leaving three forwards -- Marco Asensio, Mariano Diaz and Eden Hazard -- on the bench as unused substitutes in Seville, despite the team needing a goal

                Most companies would want to transfer cash to another company and not to individuals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are individuals who set up a private company to own a string of assets

                Currently, the tax that most unlisted companies are hit with is the Real Property Gains Tax (RPGT) if they own properties

            <p>
                Therefore, the CGT on the disposal of shares of unlisted companies will broaden the tax base

                As a result, there is a shortage of housing stock.  These are worrying times for the country’s real estate market, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) predicting further rate hikes in the coming months, said observers.  In Sydney, for instance, higher interest rates have sent prices falling by between 10 and 15 per cent since property values peaked more than a year ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The rise in interest rates is also affecting the broader economy, adding to Australia’s cost of living woes and stoking fears of a possible recession if the conditions do not improve.  The central bank is taking much of the blame for initially suggesting that interest rates in Australia would not go up until 2024

            <p>
                Observers pointed out, however, that at the upper end of the property market, top-dollar homes with views, will continue to sell.  For example, a three-bedroom townhouse with its iconic views of the Sydney Harbour is tipped to fetch A$11 million (US$7.4 million) when it is put on auction soon.  A couple of years ago, it sold for about A$10 million (US$6.8 million)

                Families of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously nine years ago, called on the government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane

            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane

            <p>
                The firm's search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, US$135.36 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane

                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful

                Families of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously nine years ago, called on the government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The firm's search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, US$135.36 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful

                Families of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously nine years ago, called on the government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The firm's search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, US$135.36 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful

                The early talk ahead of the season was all about who would be the better addition out of Nunez and Erling Haaland after the Norwegian's £51m move to Manchester City
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Time and time again, Nunez has managed to get himself into great positions and all that has been missing was the final piece of quality.  A big part of the recent upturn in form for Nunez has been the arrival of Gakpo, who joined the Reds in January from PSV for £44m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, more importantly, the signing of Gakpo has allowed Nunez to move to his preferred position on the left, with the Dutchman operating down the centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Premier League games that Nunez has played on the left-side of attack, he has scored five times in seven matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez has also contributed a goal or assist every 103 minutes as supposed to every 125 minutes before the Dutchman pitched up at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With an impressive 14 goals in his debut season in English football, Nunez will no doubt be a part of this and he is beginning to show all the potential that resulted in Liverpool splashing out £85m on him in the summer

                FIFA has been urged by Football Australia, the co-host of the 2023 Women's World Cup, to reject an attempt by Visit Saudi -- Saudi Arabia's tourism body -- to become a major sponsor of this summer's tournament in Australia and New Zealand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although FIFA has yet to confirm that Visit Saudi will be announced as a tournament sponsor, recent reports have said that football's governing body has been in discussions with prominent figures in Saudi Arabia over a lucrative partnership deal for this year's World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Football Australia and New Zealand have sought clarification from FIFA, but with the issue still to be resolved, Football Australia CEO James Johnson has now put pressure on FIFA to abandon any plans to team up with Visit Saudi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "While we await further clarity and information as to the details of the partnership from FIFA, we continue to convey this clear message on behalf of Football Australia, New Zealand Football, and our community." Last month, leaders of the Australia and New Zealand national football federations wrote to FIFA to warn that signing the "Visit Saudi'' sponsorship could "severely tarnish the reputation'' of the tournament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leading players in the women's game have spoken out against the possible involvement of Visit Saudi, with United States international Alex Morgan describing the prospect of Saudi Arabian sponsorship as "bizarre." "I think it's bizarre that FIFA has looked to have a Visit Saudi sponsorship for the Women's World Cup, when I, myself, Alex Morgan, would not even be accepted and supported in that country," Morgan said

Left-back Sylla was previously on the books of Malian giants Djoliba AC, with whom he won the domestic title in 2022, before returning to his homeland with RCA in September.

                A general view shows an empty street and buildings damaged by a Russian military strike, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in the front line city of Bakhmut, Ukraine March 3, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Monday that the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut was of more symbolic than operational importance, and its fall would not necessarily mean that Moscow had regained the initiative in the war

                A Russian victory in the city, which had a pre-war population of about 70,000 but has now been blasted to ruins, would give Moscow the first major prize in a costly winter offensive

                "The fall of Bakhmut won't necessarily mean that the Russians have changed the tide of this fight," he said, adding that he would not predict whether or when Bakhmut might fall

                Deputy Minister of Finance I Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan told the Dewan Rakyat that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, who is also the finance minister, has instructed banking institutions to undertake their CSR programmes as a form of aid to help the B40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deputy minister noted that the government does not impose any windfall tax on banks which remained profitable during the pandemic period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That is also a form of aid to the people, which will be announced possibly during the Minister of Finance’s winding up speech for the policy stage of revised Budget 2023 debate, on the required CSR [programmes] by profitable banks to help the people,” said Ahmad on Monday (March 6)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad was responding to a question by former Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal [Warisan-Semporna], who asked whether the government would impose any windfall tax on financial institutions which recorded substantial profits during the pandemic period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Bank Negara Malaysia did not benefit [when overnight policy rate (OPR) increased], it was those financial institutions that benefited,” said Shafie
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In this regard, Ahmad said not all borrowers are affected by the increase in OPR because the increase to monthly instalments only involves loans with floating interest rates

                Deputy Minister of Finance I Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan told the Dewan Rakyat that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, who is also the finance minister, has instructed banking institutions to undertake their CSR programmes as a form of aid to help the B40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deputy minister noted that the government does not impose any windfall tax on banks which remained profitable during the pandemic period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That is also a form of aid to the people, which will be announced possibly during the Minister of Finance’s winding up speech for the policy stage of revised Budget 2023 debate, on the required CSR [programmes] by profitable banks to help the people,” said Ahmad on Monday (March 6)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad was responding to a question by former Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal [Warisan-Semporna], who asked whether the government would impose any windfall tax on financial institutions which recorded substantial profits during the pandemic period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Bank Negara Malaysia did not benefit [when overnight policy rate (OPR) increased], it was those financial institutions that benefited,” said Shafie
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In this regard, Ahmad said not all borrowers are affected by the increase in OPR because the increase to monthly instalments only involves loans with floating interest rates

                In his defence of the four assemblymen, Wan Saiful reminded that Penang’s former chief minister and DAP’s Bagan MP Lim Guan Eng, had on August 2022 said there was a need for the Penang state government to amend the State Constitution so that it is in line with the anti-party hopping law at federal level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “At the federal level, when an individual is sacked, or when a party leaves a coalition, that situation is not considered as party-hopping
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But the regulations in the Penang state government are not in-line with the aspirations at the federal level when two assemblymen in Penang from PN who never party-hopped, both contested under Bersatu, remained in Bersatu, but Bersatu left Pakatan Harapan (PH) and two more assemblymen were sacked from PKR, these two have never party-hopped as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The aspirations at the federal level have not been translated at the state level as the sacking and two more who remained in Bersatu has been considered as party-hopping in Penang,” he said expressing regret over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zulkifli and Dr Afif, who were both PKR members when they were elected, have since been sacked by the party while Khaliq and Zolkifly are still members of Bersatu, the same party they were part of during the 2018 state polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He cited Article 14A of the Penang Constitution, which stipulates that a member of the state legislative assembly shall vacate his seat if having been elected as a candidate of a political party, he resigns or is expelled from a party or having been elected otherwise than as a candidate of a political party, he joins a political party

                In his defence of the four assemblymen, Wan Saiful reminded that Penang’s former chief minister and DAP’s Bagan MP Lim Guan Eng, had on August 2022 said there was a need for the Penang state government to amend the State Constitution so that it is in line with the anti-party hopping law at federal level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “At the federal level, when an individual is sacked, or when a party leaves a coalition, that situation is not considered as party-hopping
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But the regulations in the Penang state government are not in-line with the aspirations at the federal level when two assemblymen in Penang from PN who never party-hopped, both contested under Bersatu, remained in Bersatu, but Bersatu left Pakatan Harapan (PH) and two more assemblymen were sacked from PKR, these two have never party-hopped as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The aspirations at the federal level have not been translated at the state level as the sacking and two more who remained in Bersatu has been considered as party-hopping in Penang,” he said expressing regret over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zulkifli and Dr Afif, who were both PKR members when they were elected, have since been sacked by the party while Khaliq and Zolkifly are still members of Bersatu, the same party they were part of during the 2018 state polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He cited Article 14A of the Penang Constitution, which stipulates that a member of the state legislative assembly shall vacate his seat if having been elected as a candidate of a political party, he resigns or is expelled from a party or having been elected otherwise than as a candidate of a political party, he joins a political party
            </p>

                “Five years ago, you would have seen very significant year-on-year oil-supply growth, but you’re not seeing that today,” Arnold said

                “It’s one of the bull stories for oil — that the supply growth that had come out of the US has now stopped.” The US is crucial to global crude supply not just because it’s the world’s biggest oil producer

                US oil production is expected to grow just 5% this year to 12.5 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration

                About Us Advertise   ALOR SETAR, March 5 — Umno will publish the letter from the Registrar of Societies (RoS) approving an additional motion that the posts of president and deputy president will not be challenged in the party’s elections this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said he would ask the party’s secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan to see to this so that all Umno members are informed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid, who is also Rural and Regional Development Minister, said it is hoped that the letter from RoS could bring to an end any polemic against the motion approved during the 2022 Umno general assembly last January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Ahmad Zahid attended a ceremony to introduce Kedah and Perlis candidates contesting the upcoming party elections, Also present was Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Ahmad Zahid informed that Umno had received a letter from Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail regarding RoS’ decision on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier Umno vice-president Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob reportedly asked Ahmad Zahid to produce the letter from RoS following the controversy over the additional motion passed at the 2022 Umno general assembly

                About Us Advertise   ALOR SETAR, March 5 — Umno will publish the letter from the Registrar of Societies (RoS) approving an additional motion that the posts of president and deputy president will not be challenged in the party’s elections this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said he would ask the party’s secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan to see to this so that all Umno members are informed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid, who is also Rural and Regional Development Minister, said it is hoped that the letter from RoS could bring to an end any polemic against the motion approved during the 2022 Umno general assembly last January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Ahmad Zahid attended a ceremony to introduce Kedah and Perlis candidates contesting the upcoming party elections, Also present was Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Ahmad Zahid informed that Umno had received a letter from Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail regarding RoS’ decision on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier Umno vice-president Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob reportedly asked Ahmad Zahid to produce the letter from RoS following the controversy over the additional motion passed at the 2022 Umno general assembly

                Brandt has long been linked with a move to the Premier League leaders over the past few years, but he has remained loyal to Dortmund since joining from Bayer Leverkusen in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dortmund could therefore come under pressure to sell Brandt this summer before he walks away for nothing in 2024, and he would seemingly not be short of suitors amid an eye-catching season for Edin Terzic's side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to German outlet Bild, Arsenal remain attentive to Brandt's situation and could make a move for the German this summer if he opts not to renew his Dortmund contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report states that Brandt would welcome a change of scenery at this stage of his career, and he has informed his entourage that he would be interested in a move to the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since joining for a €25m (£22.1m) fee from Leverkusen in the summer of 2019, Brandt has made 158 appearances for Dortmund in all tournaments, scoring 29 goals and setting up 30 more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While adept in the number 10 role, Brandt has recently been deployed as a winger - an area where Arsenal may be looking for additional cover in the summer transfer window

                The United States and South Korea will conduct more than 10 days of large-scale military exercises in March, including amphibious landings, officials from the two countries said on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US and South Korea say the exercises are in self-defence and are necessary to counter the rising threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes, which are banned by UN Security Council resolutions

            <p>
                North Korea on Saturday blamed the United States for what it said was the collapse of international arms control systems and said Pyongyang's nuclear weapons were a just response to ensure the balance of power in the region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The UN and the international community will have to strongly urge the US and South Korea to immediately halt their provocative remarks and joint military exercises," Kim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last month Kim issued a statement saying UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has been "extremely unfair, unbalanced" on North Korea's missile tests.

                According to these reports, the Proton X90 will be a mild hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MHEV hybrid system is expected to be a 1.5 litre three-cylinder 48V engine+motor combo producing 190 PS at 5,500 rpm and 300 Nm of torque from 1,500-4,000 rpm, which is higher than the 177 PS, 255 Nm non-hybrid version of the engine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Firstly, Proton has already exhibited this engine at Proton’s Centre of Excellence showroom in Shah Alam back in November 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How does the Proton X90’s 48V hybrid system work?  The system takes the regular 3-cylinder 1.5 litre turbocharged engine and adds a number of components to it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hybrid system can provide 13 horsepower and 45 Nm of assist, which is what brings the 177 PS, 255 Nm numbers of the non-hybrid up to 190 PS and 300 Nm in the hybrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since it’s called a ‘mild’ hybrid system, the capabilities are also modest

            <p>
                "The government and central bank will continue our synergy" to achieve the government's target of 3.6 per cent for the full year, "and this will become a strong foundation to face uncertainty in 2023 and 2024," Airlangga said

                A report in Spanish publication Sport claims that while Silva wants a pay rise to stay at City, that has led to the club to try and cash in on the playmaker who still has over two years left on his current deal

                Brighton beat a woeful West Ham United 4-0 at home in the Premier League on Saturday in a one-sided performance to enhance their chances of qualifying for European competition next season

                Alexis Mac Allister, Joel Veltman, Kaoru Mitoma and Danny Welbeck were the scorers as Brighton dominated from start to finish

                The opening goal came after 18 minutes as Brighton were handed a soft penalty when Jarrod Bowen knocked over Mitoma in the West Ham penalty area after getting caught on the wrong side of the Japan winger

                Mac Allister dispatched the spot kick for his first Premier League goal since winning the World Cup with Argentina as Brighton continued their 100% return from the penalty spot this season

                Brighton beat a woeful West Ham United 4-0 at home in the Premier League on Saturday in a one-sided performance to enhance their chances of qualifying for European competition next season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alexis Mac Allister, Joel Veltman, Kaoru Mitoma and Danny Welbeck were the scorers as Brighton dominated from start to finish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The opening goal came after 18 minutes as Brighton were handed a soft penalty when Jarrod Bowen knocked over Mitoma in the West Ham penalty area after getting caught on the wrong side of the Japan winger

            <p>
                Mac Allister dispatched the spot kick for his first Premier League goal since winning the World Cup with Argentina as Brighton continued their 100% return from the penalty spot this season

                Fred is enjoying his best season at Manchester United despite a reduction in his minutes Erik ten Hag has shown how to get the best out of Fred and get the most out of his strengths The signing of Casemiro has been particularly influential in helping Fred improve this season Ten Hag's arrival at the club raised the question of whether Fred had a future at the club - talk which heightened after United lost their first two matches of the season  with a 2-1 loss to Brighton and a 4-0 thumping by Brentford - both of which the Brazilian started and struggled.  Following the loss to Brentford, Fred started just two league games before January's 2-1 victory over rivals Man City.   But that doesn't tell the full story as Fred has often been Ten Hag's go-to player off the bench, improving after being given reduced on-field responsibilities and a clearer role.   He has played a bigger part since the World Cup, registering five goals - including a vital finish in their Europa League victory over Barcelona - and three assists in that time.  In the 20 matches he's played since the return of domestic football, he's started ten games

                Though it should be noted that Christian Eriksen's injury has opened the door for Fred to reclaim a place in the starting XI.  But now as a starter, Fred looks more comfortable now that he has that defensive rock alongside him in Casemiro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Casemiro's presence has minimised the amount of work Fred needs to do defensively in games, which has allowed Ten Hag to tactically move the latter further up the pitch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United were heavily interested in signing the Dutchman from Barcelona last summer, after impressing Ten Hag during their time together at Ajax

                Kia is about to release a new fully-electric SUV that’s called the EV9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similar to its current EV6, the Kia EV9 is based on the Hyundai-Kia group’s E-GMP platform which uses an 800V electrical architecture
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The full design of the Kia EV6 will be unveiled on 15th March 2023 and the Korean carmaker has dropped a couple of video teasers of its design and lighting effects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In terms of size, you can expect it to be as large as the Kia Telluride, a model that’s a class above the current Kia Sorento
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since Hyundai and Kia are from the same group, the EV9’s closest cousin will be the upcoming Ioniq 7 which was showcased as the Concept “Seven”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since Hyundai has recently launched the Ioniq 6 4-door coupe EV, we reckon that the Kia EV9 will be released earlier than the Ioniq 7

                Two Ferrari supercars were involved in a serious accident in Italy on March 4, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The incident was captured on video, posted by SupercarsNews, which you can see embedded atop this page
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a report by Italy 24 News, the accident occurred around noon in Osimo, a town in the province of Ancona, Italy
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to prove a prima facie case for Najib to defend himself, the prosecution would have to prove all elements of the Section 23(1) charge against him, namely that Najib was an officer of a public body and that he used his office for “gratification”

            <p>
                The High Court noted that there was no dispute with the first element as Najib was an officer of a public body as the prime minister and finance minister then, but concluded that the prosecution failed to prove the second element involving gratification

                In 2021, the EPF declared dividends of 6.1% for conventional savings and 5.65% for shariah savings

            <p>
                The EPF also reported a positive rebound in member registrations following the robust recovery in the Malaysian labour market, and this helped the fund record strong growth of new member registrations of 635,989 in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Commenting on the positive growth of EPF memberships, Mohd Afzanizam said this indicates that the improvement in the labour market is moving along with the higher number of EPF members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Such a notion is in line with the contribution received by the EPF

                Mohd Afzanizam said there seems to be a lack of financial literacy among those who are asking for more EPF withdrawals

                The EPF also reported a positive rebound in member registrations following the robust recovery in the Malaysian labour market, and this helped the fund record strong growth of new member registrations of 635,989 in 2022

            <p>
                Commenting on the positive growth of EPF memberships, Mohd Afzanizam said this indicates that the improvement in the labour market is moving along with the higher number of EPF members
