                THE island republic has been in a Covid-19 wave in the past month, with the estimated number of daily infections rising from about 1,400 a month ago to 4,000 last week

                The number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients, up from 80 to 220 over the past month, is also far below what was seen during the crisis period

            <p>
                ICU admissions have also remained stable and low, with fewer than 10 Covid-19 patients at any one time over the past month, Ong said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ong said that while the current wave is not a severe wave, the additional caseloads do add to the heavy workload of the hospitals

                Reds supporters will be disappointed to miss out on Bellingham this summer but if Klopp's squad can be transformed to the same extent as the Serie A leaders this summer, then one imagines the complaints will be minimal.

                About Us Advertise   NEW YORK, April 15 ― Shares of Boeing tumbled yesterday after the company disclosed a problem with a supplier part on the 737 MAX that is expected to slow deliveries of new jets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Boeing was notified by supplier Spirit AeroSystem of the latest MAX issue, which affects a “significant” number of undelivered planes, but is not expected to ground those that have already been delivered, Boeing said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shares plunged more than seven per cent at session lows before finishing at US$201.71 (RM887.60), down 5.6 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The supplier told Boeing that “a non-standard manufacturing process” was used on two fittings on the fuselage on four 737 models, Boeing said, adding that the problem does not pose “an immediate safety of flight issue.” “We have notified the Federal Aviation Administration of the issue and are working to conduct inspections and replace the nonconforming fittings where necessary,” Boeing said in an email

            <p>
                Spirit AeroSystems, a major supplier on the MAX, said it notified Boeing of a “quality issue” on the fuselage
            </p>
            
            <p>

                The Borussia Dortmund midfielder might very well be the most in-demand talent on the planet and is also believed to be on the radar of clubs like Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and PSG
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is not hard to see why so many top clubs are after the signature of Bellingham though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United icon, Paul Scholes, appears to believe that Bellingham is headed for Real Madrid though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He could make United a proper team.” Bellingham could be a tremendous signing for Real Madrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thus, if Real Madrid do end signing Bellingham, it has the potential to be the biggest signing in the history of the club

                There was a campaign last December to stop a road expansion project from steamrolling over a little colonial-era trading post in Kasigui where there is a small marketplace, a coffeeshop and the five rain trees estimated to be between 80 and 100 years old

                It said the defendant made the allegation with the knowledge that the company was only importing eggs from India as a temporary measure to meet local demand during festive seasons to help solve the issue of lack of eggs in the market since October 2022

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, April 14 — More than 30 per cent of current Covid-19 infections are reinfections, which is higher than the 20 to 25 per cent observed during the last infection wave, said Minister of Health Ong Ye Kung today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In such a situation, what drives our local waves is not imported infections, but re-infections of existing individuals in the community." S'pore experiencing another Covid-19 infection wave For the past month, Singapore has been in the middle of a Covid-19 infection wave but like all endemic disease, the Health Ministry no longer has "very granular data" on these infections, said Mr Ong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No dominant strain Mr Ong also said that there is currently no clear dominant strain of Covid-19 with multiple variants circulating in Singapore — XBB, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, BN.1, CH.1.1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The most important aspect of any infection wave is the severity of symptoms and whether patients become hospitalised," he said

                While the number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients has gone up, from 80 to 220 over the past month, this is still far below the peak of the pandemic, and also much lower than the number of patients hospitalised due to non-Covid-19 infections, said Mr Ong

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, April 14 — More than 30 per cent of current Covid-19 infections are reinfections, which is higher than the 20 to 25 per cent observed during the last infection wave, said Minister of Health Ong Ye Kung today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In such a situation, what drives our local waves is not imported infections, but re-infections of existing individuals in the community." S'pore experiencing another Covid-19 infection wave For the past month, Singapore has been in the middle of a Covid-19 infection wave but like all endemic disease, the Health Ministry no longer has "very granular data" on these infections, said Mr Ong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No dominant strain Mr Ong also said that there is currently no clear dominant strain of Covid-19 with multiple variants circulating in Singapore — XBB, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, BN.1, CH.1.1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The most important aspect of any infection wave is the severity of symptoms and whether patients become hospitalised," he said
            </p>

                Team Aster is getting an unexpected star for their midlane during the Berlin Major

            <p>
                After SumaiL’s stint with Team Aster, the Chinese team will still be moving on from their current midlaner, xwy

                The team’s players reportedly were discussing a replacement for the midlaner even before the tournament

                Xiao Fei said that Nigma’s midlaner was not a permanent solution, and will only be playing for Aster for the Major

            <p>
                Aster’s co-owner also said that SumaiL will begin practicing with the team after the patch, since “there’s nothing much to practice for now” — further lending credence to the report that the next major Dota 2 patch will reportedly come on April 20, right before the Berlin Major
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team was reportedly uncomfortable with a player who could not speak Mandarin well

                Team Aster is getting an unexpected star for their midlane during the Berlin Major
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After SumaiL’s stint with Team Aster, the Chinese team will still be moving on from their current midlaner, xwy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team’s players reportedly were discussing a replacement for the midlaner even before the tournament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Xiao Fei said that Nigma’s midlaner was not a permanent solution, and will only be playing for Aster for the Major
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aster’s co-owner also said that SumaiL will begin practicing with the team after the patch, since “there’s nothing much to practice for now” — further lending credence to the report that the next major Dota 2 patch will reportedly come on April 20, right before the Berlin Major
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team was reportedly uncomfortable with a player who could not speak Mandarin well

                Ukrainian artillery fires towards the frontline during heavy fighting amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, near Bakhmut, Ukraine, April 13, 2023

                Bakhmut, which held around 70,000 people before the war, has been Russia's main target in a massive winter offensive that has so far yielded scant gains despite infantry ground combat of an intensity unseen in Europe since World War Two

                The lawsuit is in relation to a letter by MACC that went viral on social media which implicated Court of Appeal judge Justice Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali as breaching the Judges' Code of Ethics

            <p>
                In a supporting affidavit affirmed by Muda's secretary-general Amir Hariri Abd Hadi, he said the MACC's letter dated Feb 20 and another letter from Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform) Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said dated March 20 revealed a serious transgression on the part of MACC

            <p>
                If the court does not hold MACC accountable for the transgression, Amir Hariri said MACC would continue to overstep its authority and interfere in matters within the purview of other investigating agencies which would result in confusion and uncertainty in law enforcement

                In a supporting affidavit affirmed by Muda's secretary-general Amir Hariri Abd Hadi, he said the MACC's letter dated Feb 20 and another letter from Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform) Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said dated March 20 revealed a serious transgression on the part of MACC

            <p>
                If the court does not hold MACC accountable for the transgression, Amir Hariri said MACC would continue to overstep its authority and interfere in matters within the purview of other investigating agencies which would result in confusion and uncertainty in law enforcement

                Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama speaks during a press conference in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, on Sep 11, 2017

            <p>
                Penpa Tsering, the sikyong (political leader) of the exiled Central Tibetan Administration, said that the Dalai Lama had been "unfairly labelled with all kinds of names that really hurt the sentiment of all his followers"

                The 87-year-old's "innocent grandfatherly affectionate demeanour" shown in the footage had been misinterpreted, Tsering told reporters in New Delhi, adding that a life of celibacy and spiritual practice had taken the Dalai Lama "beyond the sensorial pleasures"

                The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet

                In this video, Hafriz Shah takes you on a comprehensive tour of the carmaker’s latest SUV, which is positioned as a D-segment model above the C-segment X70
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first three – Standard, Executive and Premium – will come with seven seats arranged in a 2-3-2 layout, while the range-topping Flagship gets six seats in a 2-2-2 layout with second-row captain chairs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This makes it the biggest car in the line-up – the X70 is 4,519 mm long, 1,831 mm wide, 1,694 mm tall and its wheelbase is 2,670 mm by comparison
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for styling, the new Proton SUV looks a lot like the Haoyue, although the front is differentiated by the grille, which is described as an evolution of the Ethereal Bow and Infinite Weave elements we’ve seen on Proton models over the last few years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given this is a three-row SUV, interior space is important and the X90 offers sufficient legroom in the second- and third-row seats, although the latter are a little difficult to access as Hafriz points out and demonstrates in the video
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also goes over a lot of the features that are available for the X90, so if you want to pair what he says in the video to his thorough text article breaking down the details of Proton’s new SUV, give this video a watch

            <p>
                Fuelling debt increase The United States and China – the world’s two biggest economies – are almost entirely fuelling the predicted debt increase, the IMF said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is set to increase to 136.2% in 2028 from 121.7% in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without the rising debt loads in the United States and China, the world would be on a path to a modest debt reduction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While many advanced economies can afford the rising costs of servicing debt, the same isn’t true in low-income countries, about 60% of which are now in debt distress or at imminent risk of it, according to the IMF

                The IMF forecast the world’s ratio of debt to gross domestic product will climb to 99.6% by 2028
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fuelling debt increase The United States and China – the world’s two biggest economies – are almost entirely fuelling the predicted debt increase, the IMF said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is set to increase to 136.2% in 2028 from 121.7% in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without the rising debt loads in the United States and China, the world would be on a path to a modest debt reduction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While many advanced economies can afford the rising costs of servicing debt, the same isn’t true in low-income countries, about 60% of which are now in debt distress or at imminent risk of it, according to the IMF

                About Us Advertise BANGKOK, April 14 — Water pistols, hose pipes and smiles were in abundance on the streets of Bangkok Thursday, as the city celebrated the Thai new year festival Songkran after a three-year pandemic-related hiatus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thai reveller Phoranee Sukjee, 29, said she was hopeful the revival of the festival would boost the country’s economy, which was battered by the pandemic

            <p>

                This year’s festival was also overshadowed by a junta air strike on a village in Myanmar’s central Sagaing region earlier in the week, which reportedly killed more than 100 people, including young children

                Shaquille O'Neal cannot be served a summons electronically for a class-action lawsuit brought against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and a host of celebrity spokespeople, a Florida judge ruled Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plaintiff's attorneys have unsuccessfully attempted to serve O'Neal in person for several months, court documents allege
            </p>
            
            <p>
                O'Neal is the only defendant in the class-action lawsuit who has not been served, attorneys alleged in a motion requesting permission to serve the "Inside the NBA" analyst electronically
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The motion claims that a process server has attempted to serve O'Neal dozens of times at both his Texas and Georgia residences, and via mail to both the residences and his offices in Atlanta, where "Inside the NBA" is broadcast from
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Attorneys allege that the last time the process server attempted to serve O'Neal in Texas, he "was sent an ominous and threatening text message by O'Neal or someone acting on his behalf." The message also claimed O'Neal lives in the Bahamas, which the law firm determined to be untrue, the motion states
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We take his veiled threats on our process server very seriously." As noted in the motion to serve O'Neal electronically, the four-time NBA champion has denied being involved in FTX beyond his sponsorship deal

                Shaquille O'Neal cannot be served a summons electronically for a class-action lawsuit brought against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and a host of celebrity spokespeople, a Florida judge ruled Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plaintiff's attorneys have unsuccessfully attempted to serve O'Neal in person for several months, court documents allege
            </p>
            
            <p>
                O'Neal is the only defendant in the class-action lawsuit who has not been served, attorneys alleged in a motion requesting permission to serve the "Inside the NBA" analyst electronically
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The motion claims that a process server has attempted to serve O'Neal dozens of times at both his Texas and Georgia residences, and via mail to both the residences and his offices in Atlanta, where "Inside the NBA" is broadcast from
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Attorneys allege that the last time the process server attempted to serve O'Neal in Texas, he "was sent an ominous and threatening text message by O'Neal or someone acting on his behalf." The message also claimed O'Neal lives in the Bahamas, which the law firm determined to be untrue, the motion states
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We take his veiled threats on our process server very seriously." As noted in the motion to serve O'Neal electronically, the four-time NBA champion has denied being involved in FTX beyond his sponsorship deal
            </p>

                District Judge Brenda Tan had earlier convicted Jonathan Chua Wei Cong, 26, of the offences after a trial

                Chua had also shown a lack of remorse, said the DPP

            <p>
                Before handing down the sentence on Thursday, Judge Tan said that probation was not a viable option

            <p>
                She also noted that the mobile phone had recording capability and this was indicative of Chua’s intent to make a record of the victim

                Monster Dividend  From a pure income perspective, it’s hard to beat QYLD’s yield of 12%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This double-digit yield is more than twice the rate of inflation, and it dwarfs the average yield of the S&P 500 and the yield of the ten-year treasury

                The Strategy Behind QYLD’s Double-Digit Yield After looking through QYLD’s top holdings, you might be noticing that outside of Pepsi and perhaps Broadcom, none of these names are really noted as dividend stocks (many don’t pay a dividend at all), and wondering how QYLD generates a double-digit yield from this basket of holdings
            </p>

                What is the Price Target for QYLD? According to Wall Street analysts, QYLD is currently rated as a Moderate Buy, with an average price target of $19.38

            <p>
                For a dividend investor specifically looking to add yield to their portfolio, QYLD is an option to consider, and I give it credit for its reliable long-term history of monthly payouts

                Sentul OCPD Asst Comm Beh Eng Lai said the 30-year-old woman made five transactions, transferring her money to separate accounts totalling RM95,700, after being tricked by an individual claiming to be an "Inspector Maria" from Bukit Aman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The call was then connected to another person claiming to be 'Inspector Maria' from Bukit Aman who informed the victim that she was involved in a money laundering syndicate and instructed the victim to transfer money to a designated account,” he said in a statement here Wednesday (April 13)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beh said the woman later realised that she had been scammed after telling her friend about the incident

            <p>
                DSP Arriz Sham said the victim's parents heard the girl screaming suddenly and found the child had been engulfed by flames, believed to have been caused by fire from a kerosene lamp hung in front of the house to ignite the firecrackers

            <p>
                "The victim's father ran to fetch a bucket of water and poured it over the victim's body before she was rushed to the Pendang Hospital for treatment," he said

                Mr Macron, in an interview published on Sunday, called on the European Union to reduce dependence on the United States or get “caught up in a disordering of the world and crises that aren't ours”

            <p>
                He's not a fool.” “I think what President Macron is doing is clarifying very well the position of France, which is that it does not want to see any kind of armed conflict in East Asia, and he's also saying that for the European partners, they don't want to see a conflict in East Asia either.” On Wednesday, Mr Macron said France has not changed its stance on Taiwan and that he backed the current status quo on the island, clarifying remarks that sparked a furore in the United States and Europe.  “The French and European position on Taiwan is the same one
            </p>

            <p>
                “I think he's trying, first of all, to boost the bilateral relationship between France and China at a time when the French economy is in difficulties, and there is a need in China for more (foreign direct investments), more cooperation with the developed economies,” said Dr Cabestan.  “So clearly, there is a real need on both sides to improve the bilateral relationship.” Meanwhile, growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait have cast a shadow on Mr Macron’s trip
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In recent days, a French frigate had gone through the Taiwan Strait, despite Chinese military exercises around the island, and demonstrated France's engagement in the region

                Mr Macron, in an interview published on Sunday, called on the European Union to reduce dependence on the United States or get “caught up in a disordering of the world and crises that aren't ours”

                He's not a fool.” “I think what President Macron is doing is clarifying very well the position of France, which is that it does not want to see any kind of armed conflict in East Asia, and he's also saying that for the European partners, they don't want to see a conflict in East Asia either.” On Wednesday, Mr Macron said France has not changed its stance on Taiwan and that he backed the current status quo on the island, clarifying remarks that sparked a furore in the United States and Europe.  “The French and European position on Taiwan is the same one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We're in favour of the status quo

            <p>
                “I think he's trying, first of all, to boost the bilateral relationship between France and China at a time when the French economy is in difficulties, and there is a need in China for more (foreign direct investments), more cooperation with the developed economies,” said Dr Cabestan.  “So clearly, there is a real need on both sides to improve the bilateral relationship.” Meanwhile, growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait have cast a shadow on Mr Macron’s trip

                In recent days, a French frigate had gone through the Taiwan Strait, despite Chinese military exercises around the island, and demonstrated France's engagement in the region

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The promotion will apply to all one-way trips from the new Kajang station to any connected KTM Komuter station, Loke said, including the one in his federal constituency of Seremban

            </p>

                The offer was meant to integrate the new Seremban Line station with the existing public transport system, he said

            <p>
                Loke said there was a large pool of potential rail commuters within a five-kilometre radius of the station, which he hoped could be encouraged to use the rail service by making it easier to reach with bus
            </p>

                Sivakumar has confirmed that an officer from his ministry has been arrested by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC)

                Earlier, news emerged that a Human Resources Ministry officer and aide to Sivakumar has been arrested by MACC for alleged corruption

            <p>
                It is believed that the officer’s arrest was over allegations of corruption involving foreign worker recruitment

            <p>
                It was reported that the arrest could be over the quota for recruiting foreign workers, which was under the purview of the Human Resources Ministry

            <p>
                MACC Chief Commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki confirmed the arrest of a minister’s aide to online news portal The Vibes.

                With both sides at opposite ends of the nine-team Premier League relegation dogfight, Southampton host a revitalised Crystal Palace at St Mary's on Saturday afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Such a statistic is hardly reassuring against a Crystal Palace side who have suddenly found their shooting boots, and Southampton could lose 10 Premier League home games in a single season for just the third time

                © Reuters No Wilfried Zaha? No problem for Crystal Palace, and in particular Michael Olise, who wrote his name into the Premier League's history books with an exemplary playmaking performance to subject Leeds to an Elland Road trouncing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Becoming the youngest player in Premier League history to set up three goals from open play in a single game, Olise pulled the strings as Palace fought back from Patrick Bamford's opener with a glut of goals from Jordan Ayew (2), Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Odsonne Edouard

                Safety is far from assured for the Eagles, but there should be no concerns on the survival front if they can maintain their astounding attacking form, and Hodgson was the man in the dugout when Palace last won three Premier League games in a row in 2019-20

                WHITE liquid believed to be palm oil waste has been identified as the cause of poor water quality in Sungai Serdang in Kapar, Klang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Selangor Tourism, Environment, Green Technology and Orang Asli Affairs Committee chairman Hee Loy Sian said the waste was discharged illegally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Investigation by the Selangor Water Management Board (Luas) found that an unidentified person driving a truck was the culprit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a related matter, Hee said Luas also found charcoal waste inside Sungai Serdang, which caused the water quality to drop further
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hee said the checks were conducted following a complaint by a member of the public on Wednesday (April 12) about the deteriorating water quality of Sungai Serdang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Currently, there is no impact on water supply to consumers as there are no treatment plants near Sungai Serdang," he added.

            <p>
                For investors that hedge against the ringgit using three-month currency forwards, three-year government bonds offer a yield of nearly 6%, compared with around 3.3% without any hedging

                Bank Negara Malaysia has kept monetary policy unchanged at its past two meetings, a sign its key rates may be around terminal levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Backing that view is the fact that headline inflation slowed to 3.7% from a year earlier in February, from as high as 4.7% in August.  Nonetheless, economists surveyed by Bloomberg are still expecting a final 25-basis-point rate hike to 3% based on their median forecasts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Bank Negara Malaysia does boost rates by another quarter point, shorter-end bonds will still have a buffer for investors that provide them more yield than the policy rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s three-year yields are nearly 60 basis points above the overnight policy rate, compared with an average gap of 25 basis points in the five years ending 2019 before the Covid pandemic roiled global markets

            <p>
                Bank Negara Malaysia has kept monetary policy unchanged at its past two meetings, a sign its key rates may be around terminal levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Backing that view is the fact that headline inflation slowed to 3.7% from a year earlier in February, from as high as 4.7% in August.  Nonetheless, economists surveyed by Bloomberg are still expecting a final 25-basis-point rate hike to 3% based on their median forecasts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Bank Negara Malaysia does boost rates by another quarter point, shorter-end bonds will still have a buffer for investors that provide them more yield than the policy rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s three-year yields are nearly 60 basis points above the overnight policy rate, compared with an average gap of 25 basis points in the five years ending 2019 before the Covid pandemic roiled global markets

                In a press conference, the minister known as Tok Mat said that military service is also seen as less appealing due to other career paths that provide better financial compensation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So it’s not just due to one factor such as the retirement plan for military retirees,” he told the press at the ministry here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The minister was responding to Perikatan Nasional’s (PN) Ketereh MP Datuk Khlir Mohd Nor, a former major-general in the military, who said that an unclear career trajectory post-military service is one of the main reasons why non-Bumiputeras are uninterested to serve in the country’s military defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Khlir then urged the government to offer a better scheme for veterans who are desperate to have a better post-military service life
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, military personnel have options to retire after 12, 15 or 18 years of service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Mohamad told Parliament that less than 3 per cent of non-Bumiputeras have joined the military because of a lack of interest in the security personnel’s scope of work.

                The minister was responding to Perikatan Nasional’s (PN) Ketereh MP Datuk Khlir Mohd Nor, a former major-general in the military, who said that an unclear career trajectory post-military service is one of the main reasons why non-Bumiputeras are uninterested to serve in the country’s military defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Khlir then urged the government to offer a better scheme for veterans who are desperate to have a better post-military service life
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, military personnel have options to retire after 12, 15 or 18 years of service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Mohamad told Parliament that less than 3 per cent of non-Bumiputeras have joined the military because of a lack of interest in the security personnel’s scope of work.

                There are also active components like the petal-like opening grille as well as an active rear spoiler on the Eletre S and R, fed by the standard split tailgate spoilers

            <p>
                At the rear is an eight-inch touchscreen that can be also be folded down, incorporating controls for the rear air-conditioning (the car comes with four-zone automatic air-con as standard), media and, if fitted, rear seat power adjustment

                In a press conference, the minister known as Tok Mat said that military service is also seen as less appealing due to other career paths that provide better financial compensation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So it’s not just due to one factor such as the retirement plan for military retirees,” he told the press at the ministry here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The minister was responding to Perikatan Nasional’s (PN) Ketereh MP Datuk Khlir Mohd Nor, a former major-general in the military, who said that an unclear career trajectory post-military service is one of the main reasons why non-Bumiputeras are uninterested to serve in the country’s military defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Khlir then urged the government to offer a better scheme for veterans who are desperate to have a better post-military service life
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, military personnel have options to retire after 12, 15 or 18 years of service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Mohamad told Parliament that less than 3 per cent of non-Bumiputeras have joined the military because of a lack of interest in the security personnel’s scope of work.

                Vivo Germany had issued a short press release, highlighting the situation they find themselves in

            <p>
                According to Vivo, they have been negotiating with Nokia about renewing their deal with the Finnish brand, but at the moment have not been able to reach an agreement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, it looks like Vivo Germany is holding Nokia responsible for the licensing deal stalling, stating that they believe Nokia has yet to offer them a license that’s fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This doesn’t stop the German courts from taking note of the situation though, and with Vivo technically using Nokia’s patents without a license at the moment, the District Court of Mannheim has ruled that Vivo will be forced to halt all smartphone business in Germany until a licensing deal is achieved
            </p>

            <p>
                With Vivo set to join Oppo and OnePlus is putting their business on hold in Germany unless a deal is struck, rumours continue that the three BBK Group giants are looking at a wider withdrawal from not just Germany but also from Europe

                In a statement today, FPAM warned that scammers would use financial planning companies' key names on bogus companies to confuse the public and add them to social media chat groups while pretending to represent legitimate financial planning firms

            <p>
                The association said that nine financial planning firms -- all of them members of the association -- have had their names cloned to promote illegal schemes

            <p>
                "Their actual names are Wealth Vantage Advisory Sdn Bhd, Genexus Advisory Sdn Bhd, Excellentte Consultancy Sdn Bhd, Alpine Advisory Sdn Bhd, UOB Kay Hian Securities (M) Sdn Bhd, CC Advisory Sdn Bhd, Harveston Wealth Management Sdn Bhd, iFast Capital Sdn Bhd and Kenanga Investors Bhd,” it said

                At the same time, the new all-electric SUV is said to have the aero performance of Evija full-electric hypercar

            <p>
                Interestingly enough, Lotus Cars Malaysia is bringing all three variants of the Eletre into our market including the top of the range option, the Eletre R which can deliver 675kw (905hp) of output and 985Nm of torque

            <p>
                For example, the Eletre R maxes out at 490km according to WLTP standards but the standard Eletre and Eletre S can go as far as 600km

                A TV screen displays a warning message called "J-alert" after the Japanese government issued an alert, following a ballistic missile launch by North Korea, in this photo taken in Tokyo, Japan April 13, 2023

                He said the North Korean missile disappeared from Japan's radar immediately after detection, and a further analysis found that there was no possibility of its landing in Japan's territory, leading to the lifting of the evacuation warning

                Varela is the kind of player who could be a significant reinforcement to Liverpool's midfield, as a squad player at the very least, and the Reds will struggle to find a player of his ilk available for around the same price in Europe

                Sadio Mane has been suspended and received a fine after punching fellow Bayern Munich winger Leroy Sane in the face, the club have confirmed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mane’s time at Bayern has been eventful to say the least, with recent months bringing claims of a confrontation with then-manager Julian Nagelsmann
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Sky Germany, after an argument with Sane in the closing stages at the Etihad, Mane then punched his team-mate in the face
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both players apologised to their team-mates on Thursday ahead of training, while Mane awaited the club’s punishment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement on Thursday afternoon, Bayern confirmed Mane would “not be included” for their clash with Hoffenheim on Saturday and “will also be given a fine.”  The situation comes in a season which is unravelling for Mane, who arrived as a high-profile signing but has struggled to cement himself as a key player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sky Germany journalist Florian Plettenberg has speculated that Mane will not stay in Munich beyond the summer, with there “many players who are critical” of his conduct

                Sadio Mane has been suspended and received a fine after punching fellow Bayern Munich winger Leroy Sane in the face, the club have confirmed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mane’s time at Bayern has been eventful to say the least, with recent months bringing claims of a confrontation with then-manager Julian Nagelsmann
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Sky Germany, after an argument with Sane in the closing stages at the Etihad, Mane then punched his team-mate in the face
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both players apologised to their team-mates on Thursday ahead of training, while Mane awaited the club’s punishment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement on Thursday afternoon, Bayern confirmed Mane would “not be included” for their clash with Hoffenheim on Saturday and “will also be given a fine.”  The situation comes in a season which is unravelling for Mane, who arrived as a high-profile signing but has struggled to cement himself as a key player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sky Germany journalist Florian Plettenberg has speculated that Mane will not stay in Munich beyond the summer, with there “many players who are critical” of his conduct

                Shaka Hislop breaks down why he sees the feud between Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann over the captain's armband as outside noise and nonsense
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mbappe, who was born and raised in the French capital and captains Paris Saint-Germain and the national team, said he wants to play in the tournament next summer, although it is not certain he will appear
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a lot of factors that come into play, and we will have to study them all," Mbappe added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mbappe has already helped France to the World Cup title in 2018 and was close to defending their crown in Qatar, where he scored a hat trick to stage a dramatic comeback in the final over Argentina, only for the team to lose on penalties
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Shaka Hislop breaks down why he sees the feud between Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann over the captain's armband as outside noise and nonsense
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mbappe, who was born and raised in the French capital and captains Paris Saint-Germain and the national team, said he wants to play in the tournament next summer, although it is not certain he will appear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But, in any case, I hope to be there," Mbappe told France TV Sport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are a lot of factors that come into play, and we will have to study them all," Mbappe added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mbappe has already helped France to the World Cup title in 2018 and was close to defending their crown in Qatar, where he scored a hat trick to stage a dramatic comeback in the final over Argentina, only for the team to lose on penalties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The next step? Winning the Champions League," Mbappe told France 3

                A JPN Kuching officer visits Lina in Ruran’s rental room
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lina’s daughter Ruran Lukas told The Borneo Post the first meeting took place in her rental room in Lawas town, as Lina was too unwell to go to JPN Lawas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She added that the JPN officers later insisted that Lina be present at the Lawas office for her thumbprint to be taken
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lina is seen with (from left) Agnes, Ruran, and an unnamed relative at the JPN Lawas office
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lina has been worried about her follow-up with specialists in Miri Hospital on Monday (April 17) as a MyKad is necessary to travel both by land or air from Lawas to Miri
            </p>

            <p>
                Lina’s daughter Ruran Lukas told The Borneo Post the first meeting took place in her rental room in Lawas town, as Lina was too unwell to go to JPN Lawas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She added that the JPN officers later insisted that Lina be present at the Lawas office for her thumbprint to be taken

                Lina is seen with (from left) Agnes, Ruran, and an unnamed relative at the JPN Lawas office

            <p>
                Lina has been worried about her follow-up with specialists in Miri Hospital on Monday (April 17) as a MyKad is necessary to travel both by land or air from Lawas to Miri

            <p>
                But Napoli's Champions League hopes now rest on the second-leg in Naples, so they need their top scorer back

            <p>
                But by simply being in the squad next week, he will give Napoli a boost and also make Milan wary of his ability to be the decisive factor for Spalletti's team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's now all or nothing in the Champions League for Napoli, so expect Osimhen to play at least some part

            <p>
                Instead of a higher maximum speed (2Gbps), you have double the bandwidth (2x 1Gbps) that can support more devices in the same home

            <p>
                According to Unifi’s FAQ, the provided Unifi Optical Network router has 4 available LAN ports and each port can deliver a maximum of 1Gbps to a third-party router, Mesh node or other devices via a wired connection
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 —The ringgit snapped a three-day losing streak to end higher against the US dollar today as the greenback retreated ahead of the release of the United States (US) Consumer Price Index (CPI) data later today, analysts said

            <p>
                SPI Asset Management managing director Stephen Innes said the ringgit had made some headway today as the broader US dollar weakened with all eyes on tonight’s US CPI data

            <p>
                “But with investors acknowledging that growth and inflation will likely slow for the rest of the year, we think any dollar strength as a result of a hotter inflation print should have faded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “More stimulus, primarily directed at infrastructure development in China, will be favourable for Malaysia’s exports hence the ringgit,” he added

                (Reuters) - Warren Buffett called geopolitical tensions "a consideration" in Berkshire Hathaway Inc's decision to sell most of its stake in Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC just a few months after buying it, Nikkei reported on Tuesday

                On April 6, news reports cited a leaked March 20 letter from Azalina in reply to Najib’s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah who was asking about MACC’s comments on its probe on the SRC trial judge

                About Us Advertise   ALOR SETAR, April 12 ― Kedah Menteri Besar (MB) Datuk Seri Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor has been urged to learn from his counterparts in Perlis and Kelantan, who are more prudent in maintaining a good rapport with the federal government

            <p>
                According to Mahfuz, any tension between the Kedah government and the federal government could also cause worries among the existing or future investors in the state

            <p>
                He said Muhammad Sanusi should leverage his position as the state government leader to explain to the public his vision and mission to develop Kedah and not make allegations or create political sentiments for his own benefit

            <p>
                In this regard, Mahfuz urged the MB to heed the recent decree of the Sultan of Kedah Al-Aminul Karim Sultan Sallehuddin Sultan Badlishah on the importance of having a harmonious relationship with the federal government
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Azalina today said the Sulu claimants — who are seeking to enforce a US$14.9 billion (RM63 billion) arbitration award against Malaysia — are threatening the country’s sovereignty and security by making false statements that twist history and have harmed Malaysia’s image
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Sulu claimants are currently seeking to seize Malaysia’s assets abroad and to threaten Malaysia into paying the RM63 billion arbitration award — the second-largest arbitration award in history, but Azalina said Malaysia views the arbitration to be invalid and also does not recognise the Sulu claimants to be the valid descendants of the Sulu sultan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from continuing to take legal action to defend Malaysia from the Sulu claimants’ actions, the new website will help fight the false claims by the Sulu claimants, she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the launch today, Zambry said the Cabinet had decided that the three ministries would work together as a team and to assist Azalina in the work in defending Malaysia’s sovereignty in relation to the Sulu claim

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Azalina said that this means the Sulu claimants are ignoring the people of Sabah’s exercise of their right to self-determination to be part of Malaysia.

                The attacker is on Man United's radar but there may be several reasons why Erik ten Hag prefers a pursuit of Harry Kane first

            <p>
                The Nigeria international is currently nursing a leg abductor injury which has seen him miss the last two league games - one of which saw Napoli get thumped 4-0 by Milan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kane has had just two setbacks and astonishingly none at all in the last two campaigns, including the current one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He would need no bedding in process at United and is a guaranteed goal-getter, just what Ten Hag needs

                Osimhen - according to international teammate Alex Iwobi - has an interest in the Premier League but, of course, has never played in it

                The attacker is on Man United's radar but there may be several reasons why Erik ten Hag prefers a pursuit of Harry Kane first
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Osimhen may not feature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Nigeria international is currently nursing a leg abductor injury which has seen him miss the last two league games - one of which saw Napoli get thumped 4-0 by Milan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kane has had just two setbacks and astonishingly none at all in the last two campaigns, including the current one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He would need no bedding in process at United and is a guaranteed goal-getter, just what Ten Hag needs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Osimhen - according to international teammate Alex Iwobi - has an interest in the Premier League but, of course, has never played in it

                According to the charge sheet, Azlan is accused of transferring four cheques — RM208,339.90, RM196,651, RM224,404.40 and RM222,811.95 — believed to be proceeds from unlawful activities from Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd and Sri Kedawang Travel & Tours (W) Sdn Bhd to two bank accounts he owned at a Maybank and CIMB branch in KL and Putrajaya respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was also accused of receiving RM207,468 in cash believed to be proceeds from unlawful activities from a representative of Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd at the Sheraton Imperial Hotel Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was charged under Section 4(1)(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act and is liable to be punished under Section 4(1) of the same act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On April 10, Azlan was charged with five counts of submitting false overseas travel claims worth more than RM1.18 million between 2013 and 2017 at the Sessions Court in Kangar, Perlis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The documents included invoices and quotations for return air tickets and hotel accommodation issued by Sri Kedawang Travel & Tours (W) Sdn Bhd and Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd, and Perlis state government order form AM 75E which were allegedly used for making claims for air tickets, hotel accommodation and transport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azlan was Pauh Assemblyman and Perlis menteri besar from 2013 to 2022, before winning the Bintong state seat in 2018, which he lost in last November’s election

                On April 10, Azlan was charged with five counts of submitting false overseas travel claims worth more than RM1.18 million between 2013 and 2017 at the Sessions Court in Kangar, Perlis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The documents included invoices and quotations for return air tickets and hotel accommodation issued by Sri Kedawang Travel & Tours (W) Sdn Bhd and Aidil Travel & Tours Sdn Bhd, and Perlis state government order form AM 75E which were allegedly used for making claims for air tickets, hotel accommodation and transport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azlan was Pauh Assemblyman and Perlis menteri besar from 2013 to 2022, before winning the Bintong state seat in 2018, which he lost in last November’s election

                The French president sowed confusion across the international community -- and left Western allies bristling -- after calling for "strategic autonomy" on Taiwan following last week's trip to China, where he met with President Xi Jinping

                Its general manager Mohd Norlisam Mohd Nordin said this is one way of reducing the use of single-use plastics, apart from encouraging shoppers to bring their own food and drink containers to the Ramadan bazaar

            <p>
                He said the usage of single-use plastic products among the public should be given serious attention because plastic materials take a long time to decompose and they contribute to microplastics waste and pollution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a solid waste composition study by SWCorp in 2020, as much as 22.7 per cent of plastic waste were generated by the public, food waste (34.5%) and used diapers (12.8%)

                Norway’s wealth tax has long been a thorn in the side of the country’s super-rich

                Now the only European countries to levy a wealth tax are Norway, Spain and Switzerland

            <p>
                Only a tiny proportion of Norway’s tax take – about 1pc, according to the OECD – comes from wealth taxes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It may seem strange that so many Norwegians are moving to Switzerland, a country that has a wealth tax of its own

                Labour members have openly called on Sir Keir to impose some form of wealth tax

            <p>
                It is understood that Labour also wants to raise tax for second homeowners, by blocking them from a planned freeze on council tax and increasing capital gains tax rates in line with income tax rates

            <p>
                Norway’s wealth tax has long been a thorn in the side of the country’s super-rich
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now the only European countries to levy a wealth tax are Norway, Spain and Switzerland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only a tiny proportion of Norway’s tax take – about 1pc, according to the OECD – comes from wealth taxes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It may seem strange that so many Norwegians are moving to Switzerland, a country that has a wealth tax of its own
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Labour members have openly called on Sir Keir to impose some form of wealth tax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is understood that Labour also wants to raise tax for second homeowners, by blocking them from a planned freeze on council tax and increasing capital gains tax rates in line with income tax rates

                Ahmad said WTD is defined as money that is legally payable to the owner but has remained unpaid for a period of not less than one year, money standing to the credit of an account that has not been operated in whatever manner by the owner for a period of not less than seven years and money to the credit of a trade account that has remained dormant for a period of not less than two years

                About Us Advertise   ALOR SETAR, April 11 — Kedah Pakatan Harapan (PH) chairman Datuk Mahfuz Omar today lambasted Kedah Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor for claiming that there was a concerted effort to remove him as the state’s representative in the National Finance Council (NFC)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Muhammad Sanusi was reported by the media as claiming that there was an effort to name Kedah State Secretary Datuk Norizan Khazali as his successor in the NFC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Menteri Besar also claimed that the attempt to remove him from the NFC was due to his criticism of the Federal Government and alleged there were efforts to lobby the Sultan of Kedah Al Aminul Karim Sultan Sallehuddin Sultan Badlishah for that purpose
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In this regard, he said only the Sultan of Kedah can remove the Kedah Menteri Besar from being a member of the NFC, which in turn meant that Muhammad Sanusi’s allegation appears to degrade the ability and dignity of a Sultan

            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, when he (Muhammad Sanusi) says there are parties lobbying the Sultan, he is degrading the Sultan, as though the Ruler is incapable of making his own decision on who should represent the state,” Mahfuz said

                A Chinese warship takes part in a military drill off the Chinese coast near Fuzhou, Fujian Province, across from the Taiwan-controlled Matsu Islands, China, on April 11, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China launched three days of military exercises around self-ruled Taiwan on Saturday that saw it simulate targeted strikes and practise a blockade of the island
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taiwan's defence ministry said it had detected nine Chinese warships and 26 aircraft around the island as of 11am (0300 GMT) on Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Monday, the final day of the drills, the ministry said it had detected 12 Chinese warships and 91 aircraft around the island, with 54 planes crossing into Taiwan's southwestern and southeastern air defence identification zone (ADIZ)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ADIZ is not the same as Taiwan's territorial airspace, and includes a far greater area that overlaps with part of China's own ADIZ and even some of the mainland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen condemned the military drills on Monday, hours after they officially came to an end, saying China was using Taiwan's engagement with the United States as an "excuse to launch military exercises, causing instability in Taiwan and the region"

                Tupperware, which was once a staple in American kitchens, is warning that it might not have enough cash to survive in the near term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Tupperware has embarked on a journey to turn around our operations and today marks a critical step in addressing our capital and liquidity position,” said Miguel Fernandez, president and chief executive officer of Tupperware Brands.  Tupperware, whose stock is down 68% year to date, is facing a possible delisting, it said, for failing to file an annual report
            </p>
            
            <p>

                “Tupperware has embarked on a journey to turn around our operations and today marks a critical step in addressing our capital and liquidity position,” said Miguel Fernandez, president and chief executive officer of Tupperware Brands.  Tupperware, whose stock is down 68% year to date, is facing a possible delisting, it said, for failing to file an annual report

                In their decision on Tuesday, the Court of Appeal found that Ms Sam's conviction from the Johor Bahru High Court last year cannot stand since the charge was defective, Free Malaysia Today (FMT) reported

            <p>
                According to Bernama, the panel also allowed her application for leave to appeal against the decision of the High Court.  Prior to that, High Court judge Abu Bakar Katar - who meted out the jail sentence and fine on Ms Sam - on Apr 13 also ordered for her to be jailed for six months if she failed to pay the fine

            <p>
                When met by the press, Sam addressed the families of the deceased teenagers to apologise and mentioned their names one by one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "But what I say here may not be enough to bring peace to your lives, which I believe is struggling with feelings you should not have felt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "My words may not bring them back to you but I would like to say that I, too, carry the burden of this tragedy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sam then thanked the panel of judges for hearing her defence in the case before leaving the court complex
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal chaired by Justice Hadhariah Syed Ismail allowed Sam's appeal and set aside her conviction and sentence in the case on grounds that her charge was defective

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 — The women’s wing of MCA has today urged the police to also investigate the individuals who recorded a video of the young couple who were allegedly having sex in public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement, Wanita MCA National Chairman Wong You Fong said filming the couple with the intention to threaten, blackmail, or play a prank can also be considered a crime, especially when it involves a minor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Clearly, the act of [making the video viral] is tantamount to cyberbullying and harassment, to which, the video producers should likewise be charged with the available provisions in the Penal Code and other legislations,” Wong said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing the couple’s lawyer Tebrau MP Jimmy Puah who said that “the men who recorded the video had impersonated policemen”, Wong said those responsible should be charged with Section 170 of the Penal Code for falsely impersonating a public servant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wong also added that Puah said the couple “tried to escape, but they were chased by the people recording them until they arrived at the Pasir Putih police station”

            <p>
                It also appears to be a case of criminal intimidation against the duo for which the video producer perpetrators should likewise be charged with,” Wong said

            <p>
                BYD SD Motors Malaysia is selling two variants of the Atto 3, the Standard Range with a 49.92 kWh battery offering 410 km of range (NEDC, 345 km WLTP), and the Extended Range with a 60.48 kWh battery, rated for 480 km (NEDC, 420 km WLTP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Entry it may be, but equipment wise, the Atto 3 SR is very well-stacked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So there you have it, the BYD Atto 3 Standard Range, which loses 70 km of range and a few luxuries for RM18k less

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, April 11 — Parti Bangsa Malaysia (PBM) president Datuk Larry Sng today claimed that a letter that purportedly recognises former Ampang MP Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin as the party president is a fake document

                Chief investment officer Rohaya Mohammad Yusof said that for the first time this year, the EPF has included a sustainable responsible investment (SRI) based unit trust fund on the list as part of its commitment to embrace sustainable investing and mainstream the sustainability agenda
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As an incentive to encourage members’ investment into an SRI-based fund, the sales charge is reduced for transactions made through the EPF’s i-Invest online platform from 0.5% to 0%; or not more than 1.5% for transactions via agents,” she said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 299 funds approved under the EPF-MIS are evaluated annually based on the EPF’s established criteria approved by the Finance Ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The EPF said that under the EPF MIS, members are given the option to invest with the FMIs up to 30% of the amount in excess of their EPF Account 1 savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fund Performance Benchmark feature in the platform also enables members to compare the performance of selected funds against their benchmark performance, she added

                Chief investment officer Rohaya Mohammad Yusof said that for the first time this year, the EPF has included a sustainable responsible investment (SRI) based unit trust fund on the list as part of its commitment to embrace sustainable investing and mainstream the sustainability agenda
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said the EPF anticipates more SRI funds that meet its evaluation criteria to be listed in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As an incentive to encourage members’ investment into an SRI-based fund, the sales charge is reduced for transactions made through the EPF’s i-Invest online platform from 0.5% to 0%; or not more than 1.5% for transactions via agents,” she said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 299 funds approved under the EPF-MIS are evaluated annually based on the EPF’s established criteria approved by the Finance Ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The EPF said that under the EPF MIS, members are given the option to invest with the FMIs up to 30% of the amount in excess of their EPF Account 1 savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fund Performance Benchmark feature in the platform also enables members to compare the performance of selected funds against their benchmark performance, she added

                "We will review again on several appointments … those who have yet to receive their appointment letters," Mr Anwar was quoted as saying by The Star.  The prime minister added that he would be meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to discuss the matter

                He stressed that only those with the right skills were picked for the roles, including the appointment of UMNO secretary-general Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki as Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA) chairman.  According to Free Malaysia Today (FMT), Ahmad Zahid said on Mar 14 that all political appointments to the government-linked companies were subject to scrutiny by the unity government’s secretariat

            <p>
                According to the Malay Mail, over 230 political appointments were made to government-linked companies from Aug 2021 to Sep 2022 under the Ismail Sabri administration

                "We will review again on several appointments … those who have yet to receive their appointment letters," Mr Anwar was quoted as saying by The Star.  The prime minister added that he would be meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to discuss the matter

            <p>
                He stressed that only those with the right skills were picked for the roles, including the appointment of UMNO secretary-general Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki as Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA) chairman.  According to Free Malaysia Today (FMT), Ahmad Zahid said on Mar 14 that all political appointments to the government-linked companies were subject to scrutiny by the unity government’s secretariat

            <p>
                Mr Asyraf’s appointment at MARA was slammed in March by the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections (Bersih)

            <p>
                The group had also criticised the appointment of Balik Pulau MP Muhammad Bakhtiar Wan Chik as MyCreative Ventures’ chairman

            <p>
                According to the Malay Mail, over 230 political appointments were made to government-linked companies from Aug 2021 to Sep 2022 under the Ismail Sabri administration

                One player who is of interest to both Man Utd and Liverpool is Juventus’ Adrien Rabiot

            <p>
                It is claimed Rabiot is more likely to join Man Utd than rivals Liverpool later this year as Ten Hag is plotting an ‘offensive’ for the 28-year-old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is a lot of money for one player to receive, but Rabiot could just be worth it

                The latest development follows the October 2022 agreement between Citaglobal and Genetec to develop battery storage management systems to store and manage excess power from renewable energy (RE) generation.  “MYBESS caters to different industry verticals ⁠— from transport, manufacturing, energy supply and distribution, to telecommunications ⁠— especially in grid integration to manage intermittent RE resources, which remains a challenge,” according to Citaglobal Genetec BESS chairman Tan Sri Dr Mohamad Norza Zakaria.  “In short, this battery energy storage system solves many of our existing challenges in the distribution of power, storage, scalability and portability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When combined, the scalability and portability of the battery energy storage system solution, with an RE source such as solar, allow businesses and communities to get around challenges found within conventional electrification
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is a viable and cost-competitive product,” he said during the launch of the battery energy storage system at Genetec's EPIC Plant here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad Norza is also the executive chairman and president of Citaglobal, formerly known as WZ Satu Bhd.  Meanwhile, International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said MYBESS will help catalyse the local RE ecosystem and the decarbonisation of the country’s economy over the middle to longer term.  “In 2022, global RE capacity rose by 10%, while investment in the green energy transition amounted to a record US$1.1 trillion (RM4.86 trillion) nationwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Miti (the Ministry of International Trade and Industry), one priority under the new investment policy involves strengthening Malaysia’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) [agenda] adoption, in support of Malaysia’s net zero [emissions] target by 2050, and a key component of this is to rethink how we generate, distribute, store, supply and consume energy.  “MYBESS is not only a step to support Malaysia’s [future] RE security, but also an important opportunity to begin positioning Malaysia in high-technology industries, and higher in the global value chain,” the minister added.  Genetec founder and managing director Chin Kem Weng commented that he sees opportunities to supply the locally developed end-to-end battery energy storage system solution in neighbouring Asian countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will tap into the global region when we are ready," Chin elaborated.  The total investment in the battery energy storage system, however, was not disclosed.  At Tuesday’s noon break, shares in Citaglobal finished up three sen or 2.07% at RM1.48, giving it a market capitalisation of RM561.76 million

                (Bloomberg) -- The line starts forming outside the central bank in downtown La Paz in the dead of the night

                The central bank stopped reporting the foreign reserves figure in February and the government last month called on people to scale back their purchases of dollars

                The central bank has referred to what is happening as a “speculative attack on our economy.” “THERE IS NO shortage of dollars, and all the financial entities are able to change money,” screams a post on the central bank’s website
            </p>

                (Bloomberg) -- The line starts forming outside the central bank in downtown La Paz in the dead of the night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank stopped reporting the foreign reserves figure in February and the government last month called on people to scale back their purchases of dollars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank has referred to what is happening as a “speculative attack on our economy.” “THERE IS NO shortage of dollars, and all the financial entities are able to change money,” screams a post on the central bank’s website
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Officials at the central bank, finance ministry and the presidency all declined to comment for this story

            <p>
                Gold during the  2000-2011 bull market achieved 130% to 140% gains in three years at two  different points

                While breaking out  from a multi-decade base (in 2005) and successfully retesting a 28-year  breakout (2008) was quite significant, I anticipate breaking out from a 12-year  cup and handle pattern to new all-time highs offers greater upside potential

            <p>
                If Gold were to make a  similar move post-breakout, then it would equate to a price of nearly $5000 in  2026 or 2027

            <p>
                Once that’s done, you should be able to access your drive from File Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac computers as the WD drive should appear as a network device

                About Us Advertise JAKARTA, April 11 — An attempt by three Uzbek terrorism suspects to escape from an Indonesian detention centre left an immigration officer and one of the men dead, police said today, with the surviving suspects rearrested

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 — The prosecution in Syed Saddiq Abdul Rahman's criminal breach trust (CBT) and money laundering trial argued today that he was wrong for withdrawing large sums of money from Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia's youth wing Armada's bank accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the second charge, the accused is charged with misusing property for himself, namely RM120,000 from the Maybank Islamic Berhad account belonging to Armada Bumi Bersatu Enterprise (ABBE), by causing Rafiq to dispose of the money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the money he raised was all for campaigning and that they used the ABBE account as it was easier to use a registered account rather than a personal account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said that he had used his own money to the tune of nearly RM171,000 up front and would reimburse himself later from the fundraising money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, he said the money should be exclusively for Bersatu or Armada and not for Syed Saddiq's personal use

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, April 10 — The expatriate permit application process will be shortened from 87 days to five working days beginning June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said companies that have good track record in terms of expatriate employment and compliance with the laws are eligible for the shortened application process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The permit application system will be upgraded and the application procedure simplified with the integration of data combined under one system compared to the previous four stages of the application process,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the application process for Planning Permission (KM) by the local authorities (PBT), Rafizi said Pemudah also agreed that it should be implemented with best practices so that it can be within a short time range of at least 58 days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Currently, we have a big gap between PBT in terms of the KM application process, some can reach 200 days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pemudah’s decision today is for us to adopt an agile process, for us to bring the best practices from PBTs that can quickly process KM to other PBTs across the country,” he said

                In August 2015, UMW Aerospace became Malaysia’s first home-grown Tier 1 aerospace engine component supplier to Rolls-Royce upon receiving a 25-plus-five-year contract to manufacture and assemble fan cases for the latter’s Trent 1000 and Trent 7000 aircraft engines
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is also worthy to note that UMW Aerospace would be the first company in Southeast Asia to develop the chemical milling capability for the aerospace industry, hence strengthening the Malaysian aerospace ecosystem,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also fulfils the key objectives under the Malaysian Aerospace Industry Blueprint 2030 to strengthen the nation’s aerospace industry, and elevate its position in the global supply chain," added Tengku Zafrul
            </p>

                In August 2015, UMW Aerospace became Malaysia’s first home-grown Tier 1 aerospace engine component supplier to Rolls-Royce upon receiving a 25-plus-five-year contract to manufacture and assemble fan cases for the latter’s Trent 1000 and Trent 7000 aircraft engines

                Pontian Youth and Sports assistant officer Mohamed Azrul Syam Mohamed Yusof said young volunteers around 20 years old have been roped in for the initiative, which collects unsold bazaar food to be distributed to needy folks for their buka puasa (breaking of fast) meals

                Liverpool are now interested in signing Ajax right-back Devyne Rensch, according to GiveMeSport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool are reportedly looking for competition for Trent Alexander-Arnold, with various injuries having plagued Calvin Ramsay this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although he hasn’t been as bad as people in the media have made him out to be, Alexander-Arnold has been below his best this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Joe Gomez sometimes coming in to provide a more defensive option at right-back, the Reds seemingly want to bring in further competition for the position
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This could prove to be very beneficial for Alexander-Arnold in the long-run, as he has never had to experience extended periods on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, this could be a great addition to Jurgen Klopp’s squad.

                Liverpool are now interested in signing Ajax right-back Devyne Rensch, according to GiveMeSport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool are reportedly looking for competition for Trent Alexander-Arnold, with various injuries having plagued Calvin Ramsay this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although he hasn’t been as bad as people in the media have made him out to be, Alexander-Arnold has been below his best this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Joe Gomez sometimes coming in to provide a more defensive option at right-back, the Reds seemingly want to bring in further competition for the position
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This could prove to be very beneficial for Alexander-Arnold in the long-run, as he has never had to experience extended periods on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, this could be a great addition to Jurgen Klopp’s squad.

                Liverpool and the Anfield crowd fought back though, with Mohamed Salah clawing one back before the break, but the Egyptian was found wanting once again from the penalty spot as he spurned a golden opportunity to bring his side level in the second half

                Alexander-Arnold experiment Liverpool certainly didn’t help itself in the opening minute of the game, with a nervy opening touch from Ibrahima Konaté resulting in a free-kick, from which Martinelli sent an early warning before Xhaka saw his shot blocked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alisson bites back There’s no denying that Alisson has been Liverpool’s player of the season, and by a comfortable margin

Arteta’s Anfield ‘plan’ For all of Arsenal’s dominance in the first half, there was still a clear way back into the game for Liverpool, and there was a genuine argument that they could — and perhaps should — have been at least level at the break
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It certainly seemed to be working until Xhaka targeted Alexander-Arnold with a late challenge, leading to the Liverpool full-back geeing the crowd up and lifting his side in the process, leading to Salah’s lifeline
