                Here’s how to make a six-figure income and pay no income taxes on it – all legally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tack on another $27,700 in income that is tax-free from a standard deduction, and you can escape income tax on at least $116,950
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By way of the deduction, all taxpayers get the first portion of their income tax-free
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard deduction can reduce any kind of income, such as investment income or earned income (money from a job)
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Trump will be fingerprinted and have a mugshot taken but Joe Tacopina, one of Trump’s lawyers, said the former president would not be placed in handcuffs

                Trump will be fingerprinted and have a mugshot taken but Joe Tacopina, one of Trump’s lawyers, said the former president would not be placed in handcuffs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A grand jury indicted Trump after hearing testimony from a number of witnesses about a US$130,000 (RM573,625) payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an affair she had with Trump in 2006
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tacopina said Trump will plead not guilty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “President Trump will not take a plea deal in this case,” he told NBC’s Today show
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Trump has no criminal record and whether he would be sentenced to prison in the event of a conviction remains to be seen

                Although the online support did not translate to crowds of supporters when Najib’s conviction was upheld, the popularity was responsible at least in part for Umno and Barisan Nasional’s resurgence up until the 14th general election last year

                One son, Nazifuddin Najib, narrowly won as the Langkawi Umno division chief while his daughter, Nooryana Najwa Najib, won a seat last month on the Puteri Umno executive council “But they will not be able to emulate their father’s political career climb, and it will be a long uphill battle,” he said, referring to Najib's children

                Could another Real Madrid legend end up joining him in the Saudi Pro League soon? Sergio Ramos’ contract with Paris Saint-Germain is set to run out at the end of this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was in the summer of 2021 that he left Real Madrid and joined PSG

                Thus, if Ramos does make the move, then he could find himself in Derby matches against Ronaldo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ramos is without a doubt one of the, if not the, best defenders of his generation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He captained Real Madrid for many years and was an important part of the best Spanish national team of all-time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It remains to be seen what the future holds for the Real Madrid legend

                Could another Real Madrid legend end up joining him in the Saudi Pro League soon? Sergio Ramos’ contract with Paris Saint-Germain is set to run out at the end of this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was in the summer of 2021 that he left Real Madrid and joined PSG
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thus, if Ramos does make the move, then he could find himself in Derby matches against Ronaldo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ramos is without a doubt one of the, if not the, best defenders of his generation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He captained Real Madrid for many years and was an important part of the best Spanish national team of all-time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It remains to be seen what the future holds for the Real Madrid legend

                Deputy Health Minister Lukanisman Awang Sauni said the initiative would require amendments to be made to the Pensions Act 1990 and discussions were still being held with the Public Service Department (JPA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the ministry was examining the proposal in a comprehensive manner as it also involved medical staff in the pharmacy and dental sectors, in addition to solving the shortage of medical personnel such as nurses and physiotherapists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday (March 30), Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa told the Dewan Rakyat that efforts to absorb contract medical personnel into permanent service without pension benefits were being made to tackle the problem of work overload and ease the burden of the pension scheme which cost the country RM29.1bil in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, she said permanent staff on the EPF scheme would still be entitled to other benefits enjoyed by pensionable personnel, such as housing loans through the Public Sector Home Financing Board

                Deputy Health Minister Lukanisman Awang Sauni said the initiative would require amendments to be made to the Pensions Act 1990 and discussions were still being held with the Public Service Department (JPA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the ministry was examining the proposal in a comprehensive manner as it also involved medical staff in the pharmacy and dental sectors, in addition to solving the shortage of medical personnel such as nurses and physiotherapists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday (March 30), Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa told the Dewan Rakyat that efforts to absorb contract medical personnel into permanent service without pension benefits were being made to tackle the problem of work overload and ease the burden of the pension scheme which cost the country RM29.1bil in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, she said permanent staff on the EPF scheme would still be entitled to other benefits enjoyed by pensionable personnel, such as housing loans through the Public Sector Home Financing Board

                Gerawat was replying to Sarawak Timber Association (STA) chairman Dato Henry Lau’s call to the state government to expedite the entry process of foreign workers from source countries other than Indonesia for the timber industry

            <p>
                For the timber industry, 250 APs have been approved in 2022 and only 24 were utilised, leaving a balance of 226 unutilised APs

            <p>
                On Mar 8, he cycled to the veterinary clinic where the stray dog resides and roughly threw a bucket at one of the dogs a few times until it ran away and he went after the dog

            <p>
                On March 14, he returned to the veterinary clinic to fling bricks and stones at the poor dogs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Mar 27, the perpetrator took a metal rod to beat the dog and drove away for a bit and eventually returned to the scene and set one of them on fire
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The animal clinic’s veterinarian had broke down in tears hearing about the abuse and attested that the maimed dog was friendly to their clients and never displayed any signs of aggression towards other people, let alone chased them

                A YOUNG man was exposed abusing stray dogs brutally outside a veterinary clinic located in Johor Bahru
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Mar 8, he cycled to the veterinary clinic where the stray dog resides and roughly threw a bucket at one of the dogs a few times until it ran away and he went after the dog
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 14, he returned to the veterinary clinic to fling bricks and stones at the poor dogs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Mar 27, the perpetrator took a metal rod to beat the dog and drove away for a bit and eventually returned to the scene and set one of them on fire
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The animal clinic’s veterinarian had broke down in tears hearing about the abuse and attested that the maimed dog was friendly to their clients and never displayed any signs of aggression towards other people, let alone chased them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “She (the mother) allegedly shared that hurting the dog was a trivial matter, citing that the dog will bite others if left outside.,” the post read

                Judge dismissed Najib Razak’s case review saying the ex-prime minister was ‘the author of his own misfortunes’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s top court has dismissed a bid by jailed former Prime Minister Najib Razak to review his corruption conviction over the multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, ending Najib’s judicial efforts to challenge the guilty verdict
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib was jailed last year after Malaysia’s Federal Court upheld a guilty verdict and 12-year prison sentence handed down to him by a lower court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Federal Court on Friday dismissed the challenge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ong said that a five-member panel voted 4-1 to dismiss Najib’s application to review the conviction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib was charged after he lost a general election in 2018

                Judge dismissed Najib Razak’s case review saying the ex-prime minister was ‘the author of his own misfortunes’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s top court has dismissed a bid by jailed former Prime Minister Najib Razak to review his corruption conviction over the multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, ending Najib’s judicial efforts to challenge the guilty verdict
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib was jailed last year after Malaysia’s Federal Court upheld a guilty verdict and 12-year prison sentence handed down to him by a lower court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Federal Court on Friday dismissed the challenge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ong said that a five-member panel voted 4-1 to dismiss Najib’s application to review the conviction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib was charged after he lost a general election in 2018

                Retirement Income From $2.5 Million A retirement nest egg of $2.5 million can likely produce an annual income of $100,000 for as long as you are likely to live
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if inflation runs at the 2% rate that is the target of federal policymakers, the retiree will withdraw $100,000 the first year of retirement, $102,000 the second year, $104,040 the third year and so on

            <p>

                FOREIGN submarines must seek permission from Malaysian authorities should they want to sail submerged while in the country’s waters, says Defence Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>

                Lim had asked about Malaysia’s stand on the recent A$368bil (RM1.08 trillion) deal by Australia to purchase eight submarines under the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (Aukus) enhanced security partnership

                Premier League • England A Man Utd attacker has sent a message to Erik ten Hag over his minutes, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed two deals for the same player could soon be sanctioned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His first start for the club came on March 16 as Man Utd saw off Real Betis in the Europa League

                Now, speaking to ESPN during the recent international break, Pellistri revealed his hunger to earn more minutes under Ten Hag

                Romano claimed another loan move could be sanctioned this summer, though only if he signs a new deal first

            <p>
                “What’s going on right now is that for Pellistri, Man Utd are prepared to offer him a new contract and then decide if they want to send him on loan next season or keep him in the squad,” said Romano

                “This is something that, of course, has to be decided with Ten Hag.” Romano added Pellistri had loan proposals in January from “Bologna and Sassuolo in Italy, some Spanish clubs but also Flamengo in Brazil.” Ten Hag refused to greenlight a mid-season exit, though the story may be different six months later

                “In India, XBB.1.16 has replaced the other variants that are in circulation,” Van Kerkhove said

            <p>
                The subvariant has been circulating for a few months, Van Kerkhove said, noting that it doesn’t appear to cause more severe disease
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Van Kerkhove, the strain is similar to XBB.1.5, which is dominant in the US
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The subvariant is just one of more than 600 Omicron subvariants that WHO is tracking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “One of the things we are very concerned about is the potential for the virus to change to become not only more transmissible but more severe,” Van Kerkhove said

                The subvariant has been circulating for a few months, Van Kerkhove said, noting that it doesn’t appear to cause more severe disease
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Van Kerkhove, the strain is similar to XBB.1.5, which is dominant in the US
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The subvariant is just one of more than 600 Omicron subvariants that WHO is tracking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “One of the things we are very concerned about is the potential for the virus to change to become not only more transmissible but more severe,” Van Kerkhove said

                First Citizens Bank picked up assets from collapsed Silicon Valley Bank at a deep discount, a deal negotiated in part by a billionaire family well-versed in buying failed banks.  Forbes looked at the Holding Family, the North Carolina banking dynasty behind First Citizens BancShares, which saw an opportunity to expand its banking empire after this month's implosion of SVB.  First Citizen's growth has accelerated in part through the purchases of more than 20 failed small banks since the 2008 global financial crisis, the report said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cumulative stake was worth $2.7 billion after a 54% stock price surge Monday following the SVB deal.  First Citizens with the SVB transaction is moving into the ranks of the largest 20 banks in the US, with $219 billion in assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its purchases of failed banks include First Regional Bank and Temecula Valley Bank in California and Denver-based United Western Bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its assets jumped from $109 billion just before the SVB deal and have increased from $16.7 billion at the end of 2008.  Before the SVB agreement, First Citizens' largest deal was the $2.2 billion buyout of bankrupt CIT Group in January 2022.  Under terms of the SVB deal, First Citizens, for a $16.5 billion discount, is taking over $119 billion in deposits and $72 billion worth of the failed bank's loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The FDIC will hold onto about $90 billion worth of securities and other assets.  First Citizens, founded in 1898, got underway as Bank of Smithfield and focused on farmers in Johnston County, North Carolina, Forbes stated

                This method enables fractional real estate ownership, which allows a broader group of investors to invest directly in real estate of all kinds, including commercial, residential or trophy

                But Uncle G has one big reservation about trading real estate as a digital asset — “everybody … forgets one little group called the SEC.” Generally, the SEC considers real estate tokens as “securities,” meaning they’re subject to disclosure and registration requirements, unlike pure brick-and-mortar real estate investments

                There is also no earned income requirement to convert to a Roth

                A financial advisor may help you understand how to manage the tax repercussions of a Roth conversion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Roth conversions make the most sense when you can choose to pay the income tax on your IRA balance and move it to a Roth in a relatively low-income tax year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other Tax Implications Federal income tax gets all the attention when Roth conversions come up

                What Are RMDs? You don’t pay taxes on the money in your IRA or 401(k) when you put it in, which is why these accounts are considered tax-advantaged retirement accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The money will be taxed according to your current tax bracket in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is beneficial if you are in a lower tax bracket in retirement than you were when you first earned the money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before the SECURE 2.0 Act, or the Securing a Strong Retirement Act, was signed into law, you had to take RMDs following the year you turn 72 or 70.5 if you were born before July 1, 1949
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line The SECURE 2.0 Act gives your tax-advantaged account more time to grow tax free before you have to withdraw money and, therefore, pay taxes on that money

                Former Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou visits an exhibition on how China fought against COVID-19, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in handout picture released on Mar 30, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ma arrived in China on Monday, the first time a former or sitting Taiwanese president has visited the country since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The two sides must maintain exchanges, cooperate together, and do everything possible to avoid war and conflict." China's official Xinhua news agency cited Song as telling Ma that people in China and Taiwan should both "resolutely oppose Taiwan independence separatist activities and interference from external forces, and jointly safeguard the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ma is visiting China at a time of heightened tension between Taipei and Beijing, as China ramps up military and diplomatic pressure to try and force the democratically governed island to accept Chinese sovereignty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She has repeatedly offered talks with China but been rebuffed, as Beijing views her as a separatist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, which Ma is a senior member of, says it is vital to speak to China to try and lessen tensions.

                This shift is helping to correct a serious imbalance, known as the dollar smile, that had skewed too much in the favour of the US currency for much of this decade

                The dollar looks likely to suffer an extended bout of weakness

            <p>
                But what’s not so good for the dollar’s relative value is better for the rest of the world, because less focus is needed on keeping up with the dollar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This shift is helping to correct a serious imbalance, known as the dollar smile, that had skewed too much in the favour of the US currency for much of this decade

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 — Permodalan Nasional Bhd’s (PNB) wholly-owned unit trust management company, Amanah Saham Nasional Bhd (ASNB) has announced a total income distribution payout of RM1.64 billion for the financial year ending March 31, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement today, it said Amanah Saham Bumiputera 2 (ASB 2) declared a total income distribution payout of RM0.62 billion, equivalent to 5.00 sen per unit to 513,244 unit holders who currently own 12.42 billion units
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amanah Saham Malaysia (ASM) declared a total income distribution payout of RM1.02 billion, which is equivalent to 4.50 sen per unit to 575,351 unit holders with 22.74 billion units
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of March 28, 2023, ASB 2 recorded a net realised income of RM536.09 million, whilst ASM recorded RM784.83 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The distributions of ASB 2 and ASM translate to total returns of 5.00 per cent and 4.50 per cent respectively, both outperforming the benchmark of Maybank’s 12-Month Fixed Deposit at 2.52 per cent by 248 basis points for ASB 2 and 198 basis points for ASM

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 — Permodalan Nasional Bhd’s (PNB) wholly-owned unit trust management company, Amanah Saham Nasional Bhd (ASNB) has announced a total income distribution payout of RM1.64 billion for the financial year ending March 31, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement today, it said Amanah Saham Bumiputera 2 (ASB 2) declared a total income distribution payout of RM0.62 billion, equivalent to 5.00 sen per unit to 513,244 unit holders who currently own 12.42 billion units
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amanah Saham Malaysia (ASM) declared a total income distribution payout of RM1.02 billion, which is equivalent to 4.50 sen per unit to 575,351 unit holders with 22.74 billion units
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise SEOUL, March 30 — North Korea executes people for drugs, sharing South Korean media, and religious activities as it stifles its citizens’ human rights and freedom, its rival, South Korea, said in a report today

                South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, based the 450-page report on testimony collected from 2017 to 2022 from more than 500 North Koreans who fled from their homeland

                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa (pic) said this was to deal with the workload that exceeded the capacity of available resources, as well as to reduce the burden of the pension scheme borne by the country at the moment, which amounted to RM29.1bil in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "So, the way out is to absorb contract workers on a permanent basis, but without a pension, yet they enjoy the same benefits as other permanent workers, like eligible for housing loan," she said during the question and answer session in the Dewan Negara on Thursday (March 30)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was responding to a supplementary question from Datuk Jefridin Atan who wanted to know whether the Health Ministry was considering employing more contract doctors to overcome the workload of health workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Dr Zaliha said due to the increase in cases of non-communicable diseases (NCD) cases, the ministry was facing an increase in the number of in- and out-patients in health facilities, causing overcrowding in hospitals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The Health Ministry is also intensifying its digitalisation efforts to reduce the workload of MoH members, in addition to implementing scheduling practices that can help ensure members have sufficient rest time between shifts, including giving leave to health workers," she said

                Mohamad was asked about Malaysia's stand on the recent RM1.08 trillion (AUD 368bil) deal by Australia to purchase eight submarines under the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (Aukus) enhanced security partnership on March 13

                According to a report in Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas, the criminal court had sentenced Low, a sheikh, his partner and a foreigner to 10-year jail terms

            <p>
                While the newspaper did not name the Malaysian fund in question, The Sarawak Report said it was referring to 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kuwaiti public prosecutors had charged the defendants “as an organised criminal group” and with having committed the crime of money laundering in Chinese currency, knowing that these funds were proceeds from crimes, theft of funds, and investments in 1MDB.

                According to a report in Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas, the criminal court had sentenced Low, a sheikh, his partner and a foreigner to 10-year jail terms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A lawyer was also sentenced to seven years on money laundering charges in relation to a “Malaysian fund”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the newspaper did not name the Malaysian fund in question, The Sarawak Report said it was referring to 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kuwaiti public prosecutors had charged the defendants “as an organised criminal group” and with having committed the crime of money laundering in Chinese currency, knowing that these funds were proceeds from crimes, theft of funds, and investments in 1MDB.

                Two of his relatives from Long Lellang have been tested positive in Miri for malaria infection recently, and he hoped that travellers to the village or any rural areas would be aware that they may have malaria if they develop fever

            <p>
                Dr Roland, who was involved in the government’s malaria control programme in his earlier years while serving in the Ministry of Health as Limbang Division medical officer, urged all those who have been in contact in the said village, or have been to the rural area recently, to inform their doctor if they are experiencing fever

                In April last year, former Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin had warned that Malaysia is facing a new serious threat in malaria infection, which is an increase in zoonotic malaria infections due to aggressive land clearing for farming, increasing human-animal exposure

            <p>
                Zoonotic malaria infections in the country had increased drastically from 376 cases in 2008 to 3,575 in 2021 and emerged as the leading cause of malaria deaths in Malaysia since 2017

                China’s long-term battle to reduce the dollar’s dominance in world trade took two steps forward this week, with the first LNG trade in yuan, plus Brazil agreeing to trade via local currencies   China’s long-term battle to reduce the power and reach of US dollar hegemony took two steps forward this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, the Brazilian government announced on Wednesday that it had agreed with Beijing that all bilateral trade will now be settled in their local currencies, rather than the dollar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second step was news that China’s national oil company CNOOC and France’s TotalEnergies had completed China’s first LNG trade settled in yuan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said internationalization of the Chinese currency had made “remarkable progress” in recent years, noting that while it only accounts for 7% of all foreign exchange trades globally, the yuan had “become the world’s fifth-largest payment currency, the third-largest currency in trade settlement and the fifth-largest reserve currency”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China has moved to settle oil and gas trades in yuan in recent years in a bid to promote its currency internationally and to weaken the dollar’s grip on world trade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, interest in greater use of local currencies is growing in ASEAN, particularly for trade within the region

                First, the Brazilian government announced on Wednesday that it had agreed with Beijing that all bilateral trade will now be settled in their local currencies, rather than the dollar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second step was news that China’s national oil company CNOOC and France’s TotalEnergies had completed China’s first LNG trade settled in yuan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said internationalization of the Chinese currency had made “remarkable progress” in recent years, noting that while it only accounts for 7% of all foreign exchange trades globally, the yuan had “become the world’s fifth-largest payment currency, the third-largest currency in trade settlement and the fifth-largest reserve currency”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China has moved to settle oil and gas trades in yuan in recent years in a bid to promote its currency internationally and to weaken the dollar’s grip on world trade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, interest in greater use of local currencies is growing in ASEAN, particularly for trade within the region

                The central bank said that a move to re-peg the ringgit to the US dollar would force the country to impose capital controls on financial flows

            <p>
                In a boxed article accompanying its annual report for 2022, the central bank said that a move to re-peg the ringgit to the US dollar would force the country to impose capital controls on financial flows

            <p>
                “Without capital controls, such an exchange rate regime would require the overnight policy rate (OPR) to match the rise in the interest rate of the country to which the ringgit is pegged

            <p>
                “This being the US dollar, the OPR would need to be raised by 475 basis points (more than four times higher than the cumulative 100-basis-point hike) to match the rise in the federal funds rate

            <p>
                According to Bank Negara, a 5% change in the ringgit-US dollar exchange rate is associated with a 0.2 percentage point change in core inflation over a year

            <p>
                Bank Negara acknowledged that under a flexible exchange rate regime, large swings in the exchange rate within a very short time would exacerbate uncertainties and cause individuals and firms to delay their decisions to consume and invest

                Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said yesterday when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 or the national budget for the second reading in the Dewan Negara that the new initiatives include expanding the Hari Raya Aidilfitri assistance, a two-year extension of individual tax relief for the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN), and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)
            </p>

            <p>
                In Budget 2023, tabled on Feb 24, the government announced the Special Aidilfitri Assistance of RM300 per month for fishermen and RM200 per month for padi farmers for a period of three months per season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for SSPN until 2024.“This was decided after hearing public concerns and complaints made to the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister also announced that, effective April 1, this year, the government will expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to those with fixed and fluctuating monthly incomes who want to own their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said the government would also prioritise filling public service positions in critical sectors, especially health and education, and this is expected to involve an additional expenditure of up to RM800mil this year

                Arsenal are aiming to win their first league crown since 2004
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fans that want to purchase tickets second hand currently have to pay more than a grand to do so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Usually, the most expensive ticket - in the Centre Upper - is £131
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Arsenal fans are giddy with excitement, supporters of other teams joked that some will be paying a fortune to watch their team come second

                FIFA announced earlier that it had extended bans imposed on past and present Juventus officials, including Paratici, to apply globally

            <p>
                In January, Serie A's Juventus were deducted 15 points for the season by an Italian football court investigating the club's transfer dealings and finances

                "Following media reports today regarding the FIFA Disciplinary Committee decision to extend worldwide the sanction imposed by the FIGC Federal Court of Appeals on Fabio Paratici on 20 January 2023, the Club made urgent enquiries to FIFA," Tottenham said in a statement

                "FIFA has late this afternoon responded to us in writing notifying us today, Wednesday 29 March 2023, that a decision has been made by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee to extend the FIGC sanction worldwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are urgently seeking further clarification from FIFA as to the details of the extension and its variance from the FIGC sanction." Spurs added that when Paratici conducted an interview on club channels on Tuesday, "neither he nor the Club had any indication of this decision being made by FIFA, based on the fact the the FIGC sanction was taken on 20 January 2023 and remains subject to an Appeal on 19 April 2023." Juventus have denied wrongdoing and said their accounting was in line with industry standards

                "FIFA can confirm that following a request by the Italian FA (FIGC), the Chairperson of FIFA Disciplinary Committee has decided to extend the sanctions imposed by FIGC on several football officials to have worldwide effect," a FIFA spokesperson told Reuters

                After playing every minute of England's two Euro qualifiers during the international break, Harry Maguire will face a familiar situation when he returns to Manchester United ahead of their trip to Newcastle United this weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I've played nearly 200 times for Manchester United and I've captained the club for three years." Maguire lifted his first trophy as United captain in February after a 2-0 win over Newcastle, but it was shared with stand-in skipper Bruno Fernandes after Maguire was only asked to play the final two minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag decided to keep Maguire as captain last summer, but made a point to his squad that no player was guaranteed a place in the team and that everyone would be judged on form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because Ten Hag wants a right-footed player paired with a left-footed player in the centre of defence, Maguire has been competing for one place with Varane and hasn't done enough to dislodge the Frenchman since he was dropped for United's 2-1 win over Liverpool in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Maguire did decide to find a new club this summer, what options does he have? There was interest from West Ham in January, but the England defender decided to stay and fight for his place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United need to sell to boost the summer transfer budget, and it's likely any reasonable offer for Maguire will be considered, particularly if Ten Hag firms up his interest in Ajax's Jurrien Timber

                Sugar is a universal weak-spot

            <p>

            <p>
                Understandably, many beverage brands have released a range of “zero”, “sugar free” or “diet” products using alternatives to sugar, and marketed them as healthier options to their predecessors

            <p>
                However, diet soda is not a health drink or a silver bullet for weight loss

            <p>
                Additionally, carbonated drinks, whether sugar-free or not, are acidic and can erode tooth enamel over time, leading to tooth decay

                Sugar is a universal weak-spot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many crave for and succumb to the temptation of a sugary snack or a carbonated drink every now and again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Understandably, many beverage brands have released a range of “zero”, “sugar free” or “diet” products using alternatives to sugar, and marketed them as healthier options to their predecessors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, some types of diet soda are even fortified with vitamins and minerals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, diet soda is not a health drink or a silver bullet for weight loss
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, carbonated drinks, whether sugar-free or not, are acidic and can erode tooth enamel over time, leading to tooth decay

            <p>

            <p>
                While not displayed at the showcase in Singapore, the Q8 e-tron for Malaysia will also be available as the S line 55, which offers 481 km of range thanks to a larger battery with 114 kWh of gross energy capacity (106 kWh usable)

            <p>
                While not displayed at the showcase in Singapore, the Q8 e-tron for Malaysia will also be available as the S line 55, which offers 481 km of range thanks to a larger battery with 114 kWh of gross energy capacity (106 kWh usable)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maybe a emergency battery for rescuing battery kong also would works great
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Audi Q8 gives sporty look while iX is more futuristic and interior looks brand new but also looks great Better try and bear the incoming Luxury Tax, Audi! What happened to the photo quality? Nice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Would also great bring locally assembled for all Audi’s models Add a comment

                For example, Thailand’s tax rate is 14.1% of GDP, the Philippines is at 14% of GDP, Singapore 13%, and Vietnam 22.7%

                Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan concurred that the current model is indeed “unsustainable”, and that the current percentage of taxation revenue to GDP of 11.55% "cannot be continued"

            <p>
                Earlier, Ahmad told the Dewan Rakyat that tax revenue on average accounted for 11.55% of annual GDP between 2018 and 2023 (estimated)

            <p>
                The proposed Act seeks to see Malaysia’s debt curbed below 60% of GDP, and the country’s debt service charges less than 15% of national revenue, said Ahmad

                The MP for Pontian said the government wants to expand the tax revenue base, to improve and revise the tax structure and legislation, and to give tax incentives.  “We have also implemented a simple revenue strategy for three years, and this is to ensure that long-term tax planning is in order,” Ahmad said.  For more Parliament stories, click here

                Saifuddin, 59, who is also the Home Minister said Zuraida was also aware that candidates chosen to contest in the 14th General Election in 2018, under the party’s banner, need to sign the bond
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I have also not received any letter from the defendant to claim that she was forced to sign the bond,” said Saifuddin who appeared as a witness in suit filed by PKR against Zuraida for breaching the agreement (bond) that she had signed, Saifuddin said Zuraida as the former PKR vice president and also member of the party’s political bureau had attended a political bureau meeting at the PKR headquarters on April 17, 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Since the defendant had attended the meeting, she would have been aware of the need for candidates to sign the bond if they wished to contest in the 14th General Election on a PKR ticket

            <p>
                Saifuddin who appeared as PKR’s first witness said the bond requirement was to bind candidates and to ensure candidates understood that the party incurred a significant amount to promote the party and giving the candidates permission to use the party’s logo, flag, emblem when contesting under the party’s ticket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zuraida had decided to leave the party on February 24, 2020 to join Bersatu, a party that later formed a new coalition to take over the federal government

            <p>
                On October 2, PKR filed a lawsuit against Zuraida on behalf of the party for breaching the agreement, seeking up to RM10 million in damages

                Fisheries director-general Datuk Adnan Hussain in a statement said individuals who handled puffer fish for consumption should also have proper experience and knowledge of the fish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said consumers who bought fish online, especially in fillet form, should also check the species and type of fish they were purchasing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The public is also advised to immediately seek treatment from a medical centre if they experience symptoms of poisoning such as nausea, vomiting or muscle weakness within 30 minutes to two hours after consuming puffer fish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the department's statistics, the total landing of puffer fish in Malaysia in 2020 was around 1,337 tonnes, with the highest landing in Perak (804 tonnes), followed by Sarawak (228 tonnes) and Sabah (192 tonnes)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Commonly caught puffer fish are from the Lagocephalusia species which are banana puffer fish, including Lagocephalus wheeleri, Lagocephalus spadiceus, and Lagocephalus lunaris

                Fisheries director-general Datuk Adnan Hussain in a statement said individuals who handled puffer fish for consumption should also have proper experience and knowledge of the fish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said consumers who bought fish online, especially in fillet form, should also check the species and type of fish they were purchasing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The public is also advised to immediately seek treatment from a medical centre if they experience symptoms of poisoning such as nausea, vomiting or muscle weakness within 30 minutes to two hours after consuming puffer fish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the department's statistics, the total landing of puffer fish in Malaysia in 2020 was around 1,337 tonnes, with the highest landing in Perak (804 tonnes), followed by Sarawak (228 tonnes) and Sabah (192 tonnes)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Commonly caught puffer fish are from the Lagocephalusia species which are banana puffer fish, including Lagocephalus wheeleri, Lagocephalus spadiceus, and Lagocephalus lunaris

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 — The Penal Code’s amendment required to make stalking an offence was passed unanimously in the Dewan Rakyat today following two rounds of debate

            <p>
                Ramkarpal said that the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2023 debated today aims to insert a new section 507(a) to provide for the offence of stalking, including acts that are considered an offence and to provide for a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment or a fine or both

            <p>
                Section 507(a) states that whoever repeatedly by any act of harassment, intending to cause, or knowing or ought to know that the act is likely to cause distress, fear or alarm to any person or the person’s safety, commits the offence of stalking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, subsection (1) states that the act of harassment may include following a person in any manner or by any means, communication or attempting to communicate with a person in any manner of by any means, loitering at the place of residence or business of a person and giving or sending anything to a person in any manner or by any means
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Further, whoever commits the offence of stalking shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or both and for final clarification the section uses the word ‘repeatedly’ which shall refer to at least two occasions.

                Hannah, who heard a presentation on the application to relocate by OCM president Tan Sri Mohamad Norza Zakaria on March 3, today organised a visit to Wisma OCM in Jalan Hang Jebat here which was built in 1991, to see for herself the condition of the country’s sports governing body’s facilities
            </p>

                After almost an hour of visiting OCM office, the national sports association (NSA), the training hall, Olympic Hotel and the OCM Sports Museum, she said the ministry would look into OCM’s application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Mohamad Norza said OCM has identified 2.6 acres of land in KLSC area for the construction of a new ‘Olympic House’ through a land swap in collaboration with a developer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As much as possible, we don’t want to burden the government’s allocation, if we ever ask for government help, it is just for land ownership in the Bukit Jalil area..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                other than that, we will give this land to the developer for a certain amount and, they will build a new building for us involving the same amount
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lease status for Wisma OCM land covering an area of approximately 1.8 acres, still has 54 years remaining as it will expire in 2077

                Hannah, who heard a presentation on the application to relocate by OCM president Tan Sri Mohamad Norza Zakaria on March 3, today organised a visit to Wisma OCM in Jalan Hang Jebat here which was built in 1991, to see for herself the condition of the country’s sports governing body’s facilities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After almost an hour of visiting OCM office, the national sports association (NSA), the training hall, Olympic Hotel and the OCM Sports Museum, she said the ministry would look into OCM’s application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Mohamad Norza said OCM has identified 2.6 acres of land in KLSC area for the construction of a new ‘Olympic House’ through a land swap in collaboration with a developer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As much as possible, we don’t want to burden the government’s allocation, if we ever ask for government help, it is just for land ownership in the Bukit Jalil area..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                other than that, we will give this land to the developer for a certain amount and, they will build a new building for us involving the same amount
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lease status for Wisma OCM land covering an area of approximately 1.8 acres, still has 54 years remaining as it will expire in 2077

                Investors should prepare for a period of US dollar weakness from the middle of this year onward, according to HSBC Global Private Banking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Slowing US growth and peak rates should cause the US dollar to start trending down again," a team led by the London-based bank's CIO for private banking Willem Sels said, adding that they expect to see most of those declines between the start of the third quarter and the end of the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But they're expecting the US currency to struggle from July onward due to the Fed potentially pausing its rate hikes – and the US economy starting to feel the full impact of its tightening campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Over 50% of traders expect the central bank to hold rates at their current level of around 5% when it next meets on May 3, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                HSBC also expects US economic growth to flatten over the rest of 2023 as the economy starts to feel the full effect of the Fed's rate hikes over the past 12 months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That weakness could also drag on the dollar, which is often seen as a reflection of investors' confidence in the US economy

                Investors should prepare for a period of US dollar weakness from the middle of this year onward, according to HSBC Global Private Banking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Slowing US growth and peak rates should cause the US dollar to start trending down again," a team led by the London-based bank's CIO for private banking Willem Sels said, adding that they expect to see most of those declines between the start of the third quarter and the end of the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But they're expecting the US currency to struggle from July onward due to the Fed potentially pausing its rate hikes – and the US economy starting to feel the full impact of its tightening campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Over 50% of traders expect the central bank to hold rates at their current level of around 5% when it next meets on May 3, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                HSBC also expects US economic growth to flatten over the rest of 2023 as the economy starts to feel the full effect of the Fed's rate hikes over the past 12 months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That weakness could also drag on the dollar, which is often seen as a reflection of investors' confidence in the US economy

                Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM), a government agency that insures depositors and takaful subscribers, deemed a safe DSR to be between 20 and 40 per cent of total income although lenders would generally consider borrowers with less than 60 per cent acceptable

                Anwar, who is also the Finance Minister when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 or the national budget for the second reading in the Dewan Negara today said that the new additional initiative involves Aidilfitri assistance, an extension of individual tax relief and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for net savings in the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) until 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will incur losses of RM250 million per year in the government’s revenue, but will benefit approximately 400,000 taxpayers,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister also announced that starting April 1 this year, the government will expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to fixed and irregular income groups to have their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Anwar said the government would also give priority to the filling of public service positions in critical sectors, especially health and education, and this is expected to involve an additional expenditure of up to RM800 million this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Budget 2023 including the additional initiatives proved the Unity Government’s commitment to bring changes to Malaysia, and also proof of the government’s determination to improve governance to ensure the well-being of the people as a whole

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 — Opposition MP Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal today said he has referred Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to the Rights and Privileges Committee, purportedly for misleading the Dewan Rakyat about the tax exempt status of Yayasan Albukhary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He replied in the Dewan Rakyat, it is the absolute power — the term absolute used as per the Hansard is proof — of the Inland Revenue Board to revoke exemption tax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is not true,” Wan Ahmad Fayhsal told reporters in Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the finance minister — currently Anwar — also has the power to revoke the tax exemption
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that he referred Rayer to the committee “so that he will not repeat his ill intent towards” Opposition MPs in the Dewan Rakyat

            <p>
                Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institutional Reforms) Ramkarpal Singh said it was because the English text of the Criminal Procedure Code and Penal Code were the authoritative versions

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 — Opposition MP Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal today said he has referred Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to the Rights and Privileges Committee, purportedly for misleading the Dewan Rakyat about the tax exempt status of Yayasan Albukhary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He replied in the Dewan Rakyat, it is the absolute power — the term absolute used as per the Hansard is proof — of the Inland Revenue Board to revoke exemption tax

            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institutional Reforms) Ramkarpal Singh said it was because the English text of the Criminal Procedure Code and Penal Code were the authoritative versions

                Anwar, who is also the Finance Minister, when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 or the national budget for the second reading in the Dewan Negara today said that the new additional initiative involves Aidilfitri assistance, an extension of individual tax relief and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "So, the government has agreed to give another RM200 in the Special Aidilfitri Assistance to 850,000 rubber smallholders, paddy farmers and fishermen, in addition to what was announced before
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for net savings in the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) until 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister also announced that starting April 1 this year, the government will expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to fixed and irregular income groups to have their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups

                According to BNM's Financial Stability Review report for the second half of 2022, the vast majority, more than 80%, of banks in Malaysia would be able to maintain capital ratios above their internal capital targets, although 24 out of 54 banks, with a cumulative share of 25% of total banking system assets, would report losses in at least one year throughout the three-year stress horizon

            <p>
                However, the central bank noted that two banks, which account for less than 1% of total banking system assets, are projected to breach the minimum regulatory capital requirements under these adverse scenarios

            <p>
                The outcomes show that banks’ total capital ratio will drop to 16.1% in 2023 but recover to 16.5% in 2024 and 16.7% in 2025 in AS1

                The Prime Minister also announced that starting April 1 this year, the government would expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to fixed and irregular income groups to purchase their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups

                Anwar, who is also the finance minister when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 or the national budget for the second reading in the Dewan Negara today said that the new additional initiative involves Aidilfitri assistance, an extension of individual tax relief and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for net savings in the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) until 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will incur losses of RM250 million per year in the government’s revenue, but will benefit approximately 400,000 taxpayers,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister also announced that starting April 1 this year, the government will expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to fixed and irregular income groups to have their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Anwar said the government would also give priority to the filling of public service positions in critical sectors, especially health and education, and this is expected to involve an additional expenditure of up to RM800 million this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Budget 2023 including the additional initiatives proved the unity government’s commitment to bring changes to Malaysia, and also proof of the government’s determination to improve governance to ensure the well-being of the people as a whole

                The Southeast Asian country's economy has bounced back strongly from a pandemic slump, expanding at a 22-year high of 8.7 per cent in 2022, but its outlook for this year has been clouded by cooling global demand

                "I hope there will be more (Messi goals), he deserves all the praise and it's good that these goals had been on Argentine soil, that has a special value too." Nicolas Gonzalez doubled the hosts' lead shortly after with a header past Curacao keeper Eloy Room before Messi got his second with a trademark curling shot in at the far post in the 33rd minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Messi then set up Enzo Fernandez to fire home from the edge of the box for Argentina's fourth two minutes later and the 35-year-old completed his hat-trick in the 37th minute with a simple finish following another pass from Lo Celso
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Substitute Angel Di Maria got on the scoreboard from the penalty spot in the 78th minute and Gonzalo Montiel, who scored Argentina's last penalty to beat France in the World Cup final, sealed the rout three minutes from full-time

                "We will never stop celebrating and I think it's fair and deserved," Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni told reporters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I hope there will be more (Messi goals), he deserves all the praise and it's good that these goals had been on Argentine soil, that has a special value too." Nicolas Gonzalez doubled the hosts' lead shortly after with a header past Curacao keeper Eloy Room before Messi got his second with a trademark curling shot in at the far post in the 33rd minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Messi then set up Enzo Fernandez to fire home from the edge of the box for Argentina's fourth two minutes later and the 35-year-old completed his hat-trick in the 37th minute with a simple finish following another pass from Lo Celso
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Substitute Angel Di Maria got on the scoreboard from the penalty spot in the 78th minute and Gonzalo Montiel, who scored Argentina's last penalty to beat France in the World Cup final, sealed the rout three minutes from full-time

                In a statement, the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) said it was informed of the possibility of nicotine being removed from the prescription list of controlled substances under the Poisons Act in order for vape-containing nicotine to be sold in the public domain

                High Court judge Justice Ahmad Bache, who had struck out Najib’s suit against former attorney general Tan Sri Tommy Thomas last year, said the misfeasance in public office lawsuit filed by the former prime minister was a “non-starter” and had “no chance of success”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his full grounds of judgment, the judge said that for a tort of misfeasance and malicious process to exist, Thomas must have also conducted or been involved in the prosecution and the proceedings until the conclusion of Najib’s trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas, however, did not conduct or take part in the prosecution of Najib’s four 1MDB cases as some were still pending or had not even started when Thomas resigned on Feb 28, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Ahmad had thrown out Najib’s lawsuit on Nov 25, 2022, with RM12,000 costs after allowing Thomas’s striking out application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that Thomas’s successor, Tan Sri Idrus Harun, did not withdraw the charges against Najib but instead pursued them, further lending credence to Thomas’s decision to charge Najib
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Oct 22, 2021, Najib filed the suit claiming that the charges against him were part of a move that had been planned in advance by Thomas and also in line with the Pakatan government’s plan at the time

                Akhyar Rashid (right) celebrates his goal with Faisal Halim

            <p>

            <p>
                In the game against Hong Kong, Winger Akhyar got his second consecutive international goal when he finished off a clever pass from fellow winger Faisal Halim in the 18th minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the two goals, Malaysia looked lacklustre in the first-half, as some players were making wayward and loose passes, and Hong Kong dominated that half but was unlucky upfront
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The players were brought into the match to make sure Malaysia maintained its lead and ended the match with a win.

            <p>
                Batu Pahat OCPD Asst Comm Ismail Dollah said the accident occurred at 3.30pm on Monday (March 27) when two of the suspects, aged 31 and 39, were in an SUV trailing a Proton car from Tongkang Pechah to Parit Sulong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The car came to a sudden halt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The SUV could not stop in time and crashed into the back of the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The driver, 42, and passenger, 43, of the other car suffered minor injuries," ACP Ismail said in a statement on Wednesday (March 29)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The case would be investigated under Section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act 1987 for causing death by reckless driving, Section 304(b) of the Penal Code for causing death by negligence, and Section 379 of the Penal Code for theft, he added

                Yousaf, 37, narrowly won a Scottish National Party (SNP) leadership battle on Monday to clinch the party's top job, vowing to rejuvenate the stalled pursuit of independence for Scotland

                SNP leaders took pride in Scotland becoming the first democracy in western Europe to appoint a Muslim as leader

                Is Social Security Taxed? Yes, there's a good chance you'll pay taxes on your Social Security benefits, so it's essential to first understand how Social Security is taxed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How to Lower Your Taxes on Social Security Here are some simple strategies that will potentially help you lower your Social Security tax bill, and in turn, your marginal tax rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With lower RMDs, or none at all, your combined income will be lower, lessening your Social Security tax liability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This problem can lead a retiree in the 22% federal income tax bracket to pay a marginal tax rate as high as 40.7%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Roth conversions and other nontaxable income sources can help lower your Social Security tax liability, and in turn, your marginal tax rate
            </p>

                Is Social Security Taxed? Yes, there's a good chance you'll pay taxes on your Social Security benefits, so it's essential to first understand how Social Security is taxed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How to Lower Your Taxes on Social Security Here are some simple strategies that will potentially help you lower your Social Security tax bill, and in turn, your marginal tax rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With lower RMDs, or none at all, your combined income will be lower, lessening your Social Security tax liability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This problem can lead a retiree in the 22% federal income tax bracket to pay a marginal tax rate as high as 40.7%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Roth conversions and other nontaxable income sources can help lower your Social Security tax liability, and in turn, your marginal tax rate
            </p>

                While the new model was generally based on Geely Haoyue or Geely Okavango as what it is known in markets outside of China, it goes without saying that the X90 has been given some design tweaks to make it…well, a Proton

                In fact, Proton noted that the new diamond shapes on the grille were actually inspired by songket

                Meanwhile, the new X90 is also the company’s first-ever hybrid model which was made possible by the inclusion of the 48V Electric Motor Synergy (EMS) System that is able to produce an additional power boost of 13PS and 45Nm of torque
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hybrid powertrain is the reason why the new Proton X90 will mark a new era for the national automaker as it is the company’s first foray into the New Energy Vehicle (NEV)

            <p>
                Aside from confirming the name of the new model and the basic details of its hybrid power unit, Proton has also revealed that the X90 will be made available in four variants from Standard to Flagship which is rather similar to the existing arrangement made for X50

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 — The Inland Revenue Board's (LHDN) decision to end tax relief for National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) depositors will pose a huge financial impact on the middle-income families, Muar MP Syed Saddiq Abdul Rahman said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysia United Democratic Alliance (Muda) president said that without the tax relief, parents from the income group will have less incentive to kickstart an education fund for their children
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syed Saddiq added that the tax relief amount of RM8,000 is not a small number, and if it is carved out per year for seven years for example, it is a huge amount
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If we look at middle-class households, at least they will carve out five years before their child enters university, and that is about RM40,000 which that can spend for their child’s education,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syed Saddiq said this is an issue that is very close to him as he had helped underprivileged families in Muar to set up their SSPN savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "So that’s why I decided to help them start the SSPN savings by contributing RM500 to each family
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The students were aged seven to eight when the SSPN accounts were set up, Syed Saddiq said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement issued yesterday to confirm the tax relief removal, Deputy Finance Minister Steven Sim said the government will not extend the tax relief due to the additional tax relief that was made available such as the 2 per cent reduction on individual income tax, medical expenses tax relief which was increased from RM8,000 to RM10,000.

                The world's largest food group was a client of Credit Suisse, Schneider told broadcaster TeleZueri in an interview to be shown on Tuesday evening, and had been following the collapse of Switzerland's second-biggest bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We have worked closely with Credit Suisse for many decades in a spirit of trust," Schneider told the broadcaster
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking about Nestle, Schneider said the company had made a good start to 2023, although further price rises by the company were likely, Schneider said, to offset inflation of raw material costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Price increases had so far only had a "very limited" impact on consumer spending, Schneider said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As inflation continues, and then also affects our own profitability, we will have to adjust prices," Schneider said

                The man was charged with keeping the animals in captivity and causing them unnecessary suffering which ended with their carcasses found in a condominium unit in Bandar Seri Permaisuri, between June 14 and July 3 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the facts of the case, on March 11, the complainant who is the house owner, received a complaint from a nearby resident of a stench coming from the unit that he was renting to the accused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On checking the house, he found several cat carcasses in a cage placed outside the door
            </p>

                He said his ministry would take various measures to deal with any issues that crop up and hoped that incidents of technical disruptions which occurred on the Kelana Jaya LRT line, which led to delays yesterday, would not recur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, it was the Kelana Jaya LRT line and recently the Kajang MRT line,” he told a media conference after the launch of the MyBAS50 Unlimited Pass and electric bus at Larkin Sentral, here, today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this when commenting on reports on the operation of the Kelana Jaya LRT line service, which experienced delays caused by damage to the communication system at the Taman Bahagia station yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regarding the eight individuals involved in the Kelana Jaya LRT crash in May 2021 suing Rapid Rail Sdn Bhd and Prasarana, Loke explained that he respects the rights of all victims to take action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I cannot give further comment..

            <p>
                what I can say is that we have sympathy over the accident and we respect their rights,” he said

            <p>
                On Nov 25, last year, Judge Ahmad allowed Thomas' application to strike out Najib's suit over alleged misfeasance in public office for prosecuting him on charges involving the 1MDB case

                Owning a house is the dream for most people, but would they be happy with a tiny one? For New Zealand-based Singaporean Fabian, the answer is a resounding yes.  In a YoutTube video posted last Saturday (March 25) on the Living Big In A Tiny House channel, he gave a tour of his beautiful tiny home that is surrounded with lush greenery where chickens, alpacas and goats roam around freely.  Calling it his "little retreat", Fabian's tiny house measures 10 metres in length and three metres in width. But through the clever use of shipping containers, he has managed to create a two-storey space
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides being his workout spot, there is also a wood-burning outdoor fireplace and kitchen at the front deck - making it also ideal for entertaining house guests under the stars.  Stepping into the tiny house proper, and you will be greeted by the sight of the multi-functional living room.  Over here is where you can squeeze in some rest & relaxation on the futon couch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's versatile enough that half of it can be used as a dining space while the other half is used as a working corner.  Even thought it's a tiny house, the kitchen comes with everything you need to throw a feast
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the same space, you will find the toilet and bathroom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Talk about maximising every inch of space
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tiny house movement is slowly gaining traction worldwide

For New Zealand-based Singaporean Fabian, the answer is a resounding yes.  In a YoutTube video posted last Saturday (March 25) on the Living Big In A Tiny House channel, he gave a tour of his beautiful tiny home that is surrounded with lush greenery where chickens, alpacas and goats roam around freely.  Calling it his "little retreat", Fabian's tiny house measures 10 metres in length and three metres in width. But through the clever use of shipping containers, he has managed to create a two-storey space
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides being his workout spot, there is also a wood-burning outdoor fireplace and kitchen at the front deck - making it also ideal for entertaining house guests under the stars.  Stepping into the tiny house proper, and you will be greeted by the sight of the multi-functional living room.  Over here is where you can squeeze in some rest & relaxation on the futon couch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's versatile enough that half of it can be used as a dining space while the other half is used as a working corner.  Even thought it's a tiny house, the kitchen comes with everything you need to throw a feast
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the same space, you will find the toilet and bathroom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Talk about maximising every inch of space
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tiny house movement is slowly gaining traction worldwide

                It also reported that if the Bills are passed, more than 1,300 people currently on death row can seek a review of their sentence by the federal court.  Ms Azalina said that death row inmates will be able to file an application for a review of their sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the courts may choose to extend the 90-day time frame subject to reasonable grounds.  Ms Azalina also noted that through the proposed laws, the federal court will be given the jurisdiction to review the cases of 840 death row inmates including 25 others whose pardon appeals were rejected by the Pardons Board
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A total of 476 death row inmates, who have yet to exhaust their appeal process in court, will also be covered by the law,” she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are currently 11 offences that carry the mandatory death penalty, including murder, drug trafficking, terrorism, kidnapping and possession of firearms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last June, the Malaysian government announced its decision to abolish the mandatory death penalty as part of its commitment at the international level to refrain from imposing capital punishment.  “We are of the view that everyone deserves a second chance,” said former prime minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob, according to Bernama.

                It also reported that if the Bills are passed, more than 1,300 people currently on death row can seek a review of their sentence by the federal court.  Ms Azalina said that death row inmates will be able to file an application for a review of their sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the courts may choose to extend the 90-day time frame subject to reasonable grounds.  Ms Azalina also noted that through the proposed laws, the federal court will be given the jurisdiction to review the cases of 840 death row inmates including 25 others whose pardon appeals were rejected by the Pardons Board
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A total of 476 death row inmates, who have yet to exhaust their appeal process in court, will also be covered by the law,” she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are currently 11 offences that carry the mandatory death penalty, including murder, drug trafficking, terrorism, kidnapping and possession of firearms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last June, the Malaysian government announced its decision to abolish the mandatory death penalty as part of its commitment at the international level to refrain from imposing capital punishment.  “We are of the view that everyone deserves a second chance,” said former prime minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob, according to Bernama.

            <p>
                Anwar said the existing law allows donations to be given to political parties, but previous prosecutions involving political party funds were related to the awarding of contracts

            <p>
                "I have no problem (with any investigation into political funds received by the government political parties), but we must understand that the (existing) laws allow donations to political parties

                Margma expects global glove demand to hit 300 billion pieces this year, up from 280 billion pieces in 2018 and 340 billion pieces in 2019

            <p>
                The research firm noted challenges remain for glove makers in the near term, as the excess supply of gloves in the market continues to affect the industry’s average selling price (ASP), followed by persisting low utilisation rates

                MIDF Research, in a report, noted the utilisation rate fell from 35% to 40% in the fourth quarter of 2022 (4Q22) to 32% to 35% in 1Q23, which was barely half of the rate in 2019

                Moving forward, MIDF Research believes the raw material prices will stay high due to decreased NR latex concentrate production during the winter season until May 2023, as well as increased demand for butadiene and acrylonitrile

                In a statement on Monday (March 27), the firm said the bulk of these US$5 billion (RM22 billion) opportunities in Southeast Asia are in Indonesia, where upwards of US$2 billion of assets are on the market, followed by Malaysia and Vietnam which have approximately US$1.4 billion and US$1 billion for sale respectively

                At the Court of Appeal here yesterday, a three-judge panel chaired by Justice Hanipah Farikullah allowed Ahmad Zahid’s application to review the High Court’s decision on Feb 3 that dismissed his request to keep his personal and diplomatic passports with him permanently

            <p>

                On Feb 3, Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah (now a Court of Appeal judge) only allowed Ahmad Zahid temporary access to his passport in order for the Bagan Datuk MP to have his diplomatic passport made

                Following this, Ahmad Zahid would have to return his passport to the court

            <p>
                On Jan 20, Ahmad Zahid filed the application for permanent release of his passport, which he said was done bona fide (with good intentions) so he could perform his official duties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said he needed the passport back as he was required to travel out of the country as part of this duty and it would also help him apply for a diplomatic passport for official travel.

                Micron’s gross margins hit a bottom in November 2008, when the company was paying, on average, $1.30 to make a chip it could only sell for $1, according to the analyst’s data

            <p>
                Micron did not guide for negative gross margins, predicting a gross margin of 5% to 10% in December, and analysts on average expect gross income of $312 million on revenue of $3.71 billion

                The prices of those chips have plunged — DRAM and NAND both saw quarter-over-quarter price declines of greater than 20% in Micron’s fiscal first quarter, and analysts expect Micron to report a similar decline in DRAM prices in the just completed quarter, while NAND’s average selling price is expected to fall 7.4%

                The minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institutional Reform) said Malaysia has distanced itself from the 2019 letter and obtained a court order to stop him from commenting further on the Sulu claimants’ arbitration claim against Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azalina said the Malaysian government will not represent Thomas in the civil lawsuit where nine Sabah politicians have sued the former AG for alleged misfeasance in public office and were seeking a court order for him to retract his prejudicial remarks over an arbitration in which Malaysia was ordered to pay US$14.92 billion to the Sulu claimants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In this matter, the Attorney General’s Chambers has filed an application to intervene on the Malaysian government’s behalf, besides also applying to obtain an order for stay of proceedings, and an order to stop the former attorney-general from giving any statements or comments relating to the Sulu sultanate’s heirs’ arbitration proceedings against the Malaysian government,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said the High Court in Kota Kinabalu had on January 3 approved the Malaysian government’s application to intervene and to obtain those two court orders, including the order to stop Thomas from making comments on the arbitration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas last year said there would “no longer be any dispute” with Malaysia if the Sulu claimants had accepted the offered payment, which their lawyer rejected

            <p>
                Between 2017 and 2018, the eight Sulu claimants initiated international arbitration proceedings seeking up to US$32.2 billion from Malaysia over Sabah, which resulted in Spanish arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa deciding to order Malaysia to pay US$14.9 billion as compensation

            <p>
                After this week's notifications, a "larger" round of notifications will come in April and a final round will hit "before the beginning of summer" to get the company to the 7,000 target, according to the report

            <p>
                Iger said Disney has made a "difficult decision" to reduce its overall workforce as "part of a strategic realignment of the company, including important cost-saving measures necessary for creating a more effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our business."    Disney announced 7,000 job layoffs from its global workforce on Feb

                The reason why it would fall short? Because of a TikTok data centre within its region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Morten Brandtzæg, Nammo’s chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times (paywall), the heavy arms and ammo production company says that the reason it believes it will fall short of its demand quota is because a TikTok datacentre in the region, is said to be hogging all of the electricity within the area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is another extenuating factor which Brandtzæg isn’t fully addressing, but isn’t pushing to the side either, and that is whether China currently has had a hand in influencing ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to undermine Nammo’s production capabilities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I will not rule out that it’s not by pure coincidence that this activity is close to a defense company,” Brandtzæg said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the Norwegian company, that demand is 15 times higher than what its average demand and output was, prior to the war

                The Islamist party’s Selangor commissioner Datuk Dr Ahmad Yunus Hairi said Sultan Sharafuddin’s statement reiterated the Selangor Islamic Religious Council’s (Mais) stand that Muslims are prohibited from participating in rituals of non-Muslim places of worship

            <p>
                “There is nothing wrong with attending a wedding or a wake at a church, for example, but Muslims must just observe,” Sultan Sharafuddin said

            <p>
                Dr Ahmad Yunus also urged all Muslims in the state to adhere to the prohibition

                He added that tolerance and mutual respect were very important and Selangor PAS will ensure that no one interferes with the current peaceful existence.

                The Islamist party’s Selangor commissioner Datuk Dr Ahmad Yunus Hairi said Sultan Sharafuddin’s statement reiterated the Selangor Islamic Religious Council’s (Mais) stand that Muslims are prohibited from participating in rituals of non-Muslim places of worship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sultan Sharafuddin told The Star in an interview earlier that the relevant state and federal laws to protect the faith of Muslims in Selangor were clear and must be respected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There is nothing wrong with attending a wedding or a wake at a church, for example, but Muslims must just observe,” Sultan Sharafuddin said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Ahmad Yunus also urged all Muslims in the state to adhere to the prohibition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Communal harmony and peaceful living among the multi-racial people of Selangor is important for the peace and prosperity of the state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that tolerance and mutual respect were very important and Selangor PAS will ensure that no one interferes with the current peaceful existence.

                When you need another stream of income for retirement, you might consider an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before buying an annuity, it’s important to consider how much monthly income it might generate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How Much Does a $300,000 Annuity Pay Per Month? How much a $300,000 annuity pays per month largely depends on when you purchase the annuity, how annuity funds are invested and how much time it has to grow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Using an annuity calculator can help you estimate how much money a $300,000 annuity (or an annuity in any other amount) may generate in monthly income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you have a specific monthly income need that you would like an annuity to meet, you might have to adjust the annuity amount to produce that level of income for yourself and your spouse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How Much Monthly Income Can I Expect From an Annuity? The amount of monthly income an annuity generates depends largely on the type of annuity, its face value and how much interest the annuity earns

                How Much Does a $300,000 Annuity Pay Per Month? How much a $300,000 annuity pays per month largely depends on when you purchase the annuity, how annuity funds are invested and how much time it has to grow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Using an annuity calculator can help you estimate how much money a $300,000 annuity (or an annuity in any other amount) may generate in monthly income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you have a specific monthly income need that you would like an annuity to meet, you might have to adjust the annuity amount to produce that level of income for yourself and your spouse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How Much Monthly Income Can I Expect From an Annuity? The amount of monthly income an annuity generates depends largely on the type of annuity, its face value and how much interest the annuity earns

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 — The level of corruption involving enforcement personnel at the country’s frontlines is growing chronic and worrisome, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) deputy chief commissioner (Operations) Datuk Seri Ahmad Khusairi Yahaya said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Khusairi said the influx of illegal immigrants, workers and students in the country was viewed as a big opportunity for a minority of unethical enforcement personnel to secure bribes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We often deny and ignore reality, looking for various excuses,” he said.Ahmad Khusairi said the most common comment about corruption among enforcement was that it was ‘an isolated incident’, and that it no longer could be used as an excuse to deny the reality of how rampant it was among enforcement personnel

                Taiwan's former President Ma Ying-jeou (centre) arriving at Shanghai's Pudong International airport, on March 27, 2023
            </p>

            <p>
                Ant Group said in January Ma had ceded control of the fintech company, adjusting its ownership structure so that “no shareholder, alone or jointly with other parties, will have control over Ant Group”

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 — Several victims of the Kelana Jaya Light Rail Transit (LRT) train crash in 2021 are suing Prasarana Malaysia and Rapid Rail Sdn Bhd for damages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plaintiffs are claiming that both Prasarana and Rapid Rail did not ensure the trains were safe to use and that the accident happened due to negligence on their part

            <p>
                In the May 24, 2021 incident, a train ferrying 213 passengers collided with a faulty train which was being test-driven (autonomously) in a tunnel between the Kampung Baru and KLCC stations

            <p>
                Former Pasir Salak MP Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman, who was Prasarana chairman at the time, faced heavy criticism for his lack of empathy, lack of professionalism and remarks made during a press conference following the crash

                In his statement of claim, Lim said the former prime minister had defamed him in Facebook posts after being released on bail by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission on March 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim, who was finance minister from 2018 to 2020 during the Pakatan Harapan administration, claimed that Muhyiddin's statement also implied that he had cancelled the approved tax exemption status given to Yayasan Al-Bukhary

            <p>

            <p>
                On March 21, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim confirmed in Parliament that Lim did not revoke the foundation's tax exempt status, which was contrary to Muhyiddin's claims.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 — Machang MP Wan Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal today filed an emergency motion to discuss Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's recent visit to Saudi Arabia in the Dewan Rakyat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also hopes Anwar will attend tomorrow’s scheduled Prime Minister’s Question Time in the Dewan Rakyat tomorrow so that the Opposition’s questions can be answered directly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will not make a police report,” Wan Fayhsal said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar began his official three-day visit to Saudi Arabia on March 22 and was accompanied by his wife Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Zambry Abdul Kadir and Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Saudi government was reported last Saturday to have invited Anwar to extend his visit there for two more days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar is currently in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a one-day visit.

                Sign up for our daily newsletter to get the day's biggest stories sent direct to your inbox We have more newsletters Given that Marcus Rashford has been in such scintillating form in front of goal so far this season, Manchester United's underwhelming goal return has gone somewhat unpunished
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the Portuguese ace having also registered 12 assists, his goal return is more than respectable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 29-year-old has impressed at Old Trafford since joining the club on loan from Bayern Munich in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While scoring has never been one of McTominay's main attributes, his second and third international goals show that the United man is capable of having an impact in front of goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The South American side ultimately lost 2-1 to Morocco on Saturday night, but the Reds midfielder - albeit somewhat fortunately - managed to score his sixth goal for his country
            </p>

            <p>
                With the Portuguese ace having also registered 12 assists, his goal return is more than respectable

                The 29-year-old has impressed at Old Trafford since joining the club on loan from Bayern Munich in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While scoring has never been one of McTominay's main attributes, his second and third international goals show that the United man is capable of having an impact in front of goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The South American side ultimately lost 2-1 to Morocco on Saturday night, but the Reds midfielder - albeit somewhat fortunately - managed to score his sixth goal for his country

                Man Utd are looking to sign a creative midfielder this summer and could offer Marcel Sabitzer a permanent role
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sabitzer will most likely need to be used in a more defensive role to help compensate for the Brazilian's absence, further adding to the dilemma of which position suits him best
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no option to make his loan deal permanent, though United could negotiate with Bayern at any time about doing so if they wanted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United will almost certainly look to sign another creative midfielder this summer, and Sabitzer isn't distracted by the fact that it could end up being him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The good news for United and Ten Hag is that they are getting much closer to being in a position where that will be the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When that is the case, it is most likely Ten Hag will resort to the same midfield trio that played a key role in their resurgence this season, with Sabitzer dropping to the bench alongside Fred and Scott McTominay

                Man Utd are looking to sign a creative midfielder this summer and could offer Marcel Sabitzer a permanent role
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sabitzer will most likely need to be used in a more defensive role to help compensate for the Brazilian's absence, further adding to the dilemma of which position suits him best
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no option to make his loan deal permanent, though United could negotiate with Bayern at any time about doing so if they wanted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United will almost certainly look to sign another creative midfielder this summer, and Sabitzer isn't distracted by the fact that it could end up being him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The good news for United and Ten Hag is that they are getting much closer to being in a position where that will be the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When that is the case, it is most likely Ten Hag will resort to the same midfield trio that played a key role in their resurgence this season, with Sabitzer dropping to the bench alongside Fred and Scott McTominay

            <p>
                The demand for chicken is expected to increase due to the upcoming Hari Raya Puasa festive period, celebrated by Muslims who make up the majority in Malaysia.  Separately, the Terengganu Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living said that there has been a drop of up to 33 per cent in the supply of eggs in the state during Ramadan due to a shortage from out-of-state suppliers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is due to the increasing demand for eggs during Ramadan and the farms prioritise their own local market first.”  In June last year, a month after Hari Raya Puasa, Malaysia was forced to implement temporary export restrictions on chicken to address the domestic chicken supply shortage which had also driven up the prices of chicken.  The export ban was partially lifted in October for live broiler chickens

            <p>
                Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God), now the supply of chicken and eggs is beginning to recover and will be stable again soon,” he said, adding that it was a “commendable achievement”.

                Protesters demonstrate in front of 'Landungsbruecken' at the harbour during a nationwide strike called by the German trade union Verdi over a wage dispute in Hamburg, Germany, on Mar 27, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Verdi is demanding a 10.5 per cent wage increase, which would see pay rising by at least 500 euros (US$538) per month, while EVG is asking for a 12 per cent raise or at least 650 euros per month

                Commerzbank Chief Economist Joerg Kraemer said the economic impact of Monday's strike on Germany's 181-million-euro (US$194-million) -a-day transport sector was limited so far but this could change if the strikes persisted over a longer time

                The construction and property group and its partner, via Venta Belgarum II Ltd Pt (VB II), have signed a sale and purchase agreement with Wessex Winchester Ltd Pt to acquire 100% equity interest in Wessex Winchester Propco Ltd, the owner of the 317,000 sq ft Winchester House
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gamuda's wholly owned Gamuda Land (Labuan) Ltd holds a 75% stake in VB II, while Castleforge’s wholly-owned partnership entity Athelstan Ltd owns the remaining 25%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The acquisition is part of its property development arm Gamuda Land’s quick-turnaround-project (QTP) strategy, which aims to build a regional portfolio of real estate projects with high internal rates of return with investment time frames of five years or less, Gamuda's filing showed

            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Gamuda, the group’s outlay for the 75% equity interest in Wessex Winchester Propco via VB II will amount to £52 million, which will be funded via foreign currency-denominated bank borrowings

                Protestors demonstrate in front of 'Landungsbruecken' at the harbour during a nationwide strike called by the German trade union Verdi over a wage dispute in Hamburg, Germany, March 27, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Verdi is demanding a 10.5% wage increase, which would see pay rising by at least 500 euros per month, while EVG is asking for a 12% raise or at least 650 euros per month
            </p>

                The walkout is the biggest in Germany, which has a long history of collective wage bargaining, since 1992, according to Verdi
