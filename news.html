                (Bloomberg) -- China invoked the US’s brinkmanship over its own debt limit as it hit back at Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s criticism of Beijing’s handling of debt issues in developing countries

                China holds about $870 billion in US debt, according to the latest data for November, down from more than $1.3 trillion in late 2013

            <p>
                Debt Burden China has come under criticism for its perceived lack of engagement in a global effort to reduce debt burdens for developing nations, with Yellen saying on multiple occasions that Beijing has become the biggest obstacle to progress

                “Assuming Secretary Yellen’s statements about debt were correct, the best prospect of the debt issues outside the US would be the US Treasury Department solving the US’ own domestic debt problem, given how well she knows about facts, her professional capacities and her team’s implementation ability,” the Chinese embassy in Lusaka said

                Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing said this was important to overcome the problem of long waiting times following the increasing number of tourists coming into Malaysia

                According to the statement, Tiong, on checking out the tourist arrival process at KLIA, found that tourists had to queue and were made to wait, some for almost two hours for the immigration check-in process

                Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing said this was important to overcome the problem of long waiting times following the increasing number of tourists coming into Malaysia

            <p>
                "The facial recognition system used by the Immigration Department should be extended to all international visitors and not limited to those holding long-term permits, to facilitate the clearance process

                PRESIDENT Joko Widodo’s (pic) approval rating has hit an all-time high after the government eased Covid-19 restrictions last month, a poll showed

                New Manchester United winger Antony has failed to impress during his time so far at the club Antony (L) scored on his Premier League debut during United's win over Arsenal in September Since then, the Brazilian has struggled to find form and was hooked off during Sunday's defeat Like with every newcomer to the English top-flight, there is a fair argument that the 22-year-old needs to be given reasonable time to adjust to the demands of playing in what many consider the toughest league in the world, but patience amongst United fans and former players is running out

                Scoring on his debut in United's 3-1 win over Arsenal near the start of the season, Antony went on to score in his next two league games, but since then highlights have been few and far between as the Brazilian struggled to build on bright moments

                Club legend Rio Ferdinand questioned Antony's quality following Sunday's defeat at Arsenal He needs to improve quickly with the impending return of Jadon Sancho bringing competition His trademark spin combined with blistering pace and an array of skills typical of Brazilian wingers means Antony has all the hallmarks to be a success in England's north-west.  But he needs to start demonstrating the qualities that first earned him a move to the club or else faces the exit door

            <p>
                The impending return of Sancho only heaps more pressure on Antony to start producing the goods for Man United with the club still realistically in the hunt for the Premier League title, but if improvement isn't seen soon then it would be no surprise to see Ten Hag drop the star and head back to the transfer market

                The Guardian claims Rice is also a topic of interest at Chelsea and Manchester United, but he would prefer to sign for Arsenal

                The Guardian claims Rice is also a topic of interest at Chelsea and Manchester United, but he would prefer to sign for Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the Mirror, new Arsenal signing Leandro Trossard has revealed he was close to signing for Spurs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Trossard came off the bench in Arsenal’s silencing of Manchester United last night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s time to refresh Arsenal’s Twitter feed constantly

                The Poland international was in the crowd as Arsenal beat Manchester United last night

            <p>
                There is surely a Mudryk reference in there, but I would say Arsenal are too classy to announce a signing at half-time

                Via Manchester Evening News, ten Hag said his players 'have to change their mentality' if they want to be successful, after admitting he was 'annoyed' by the defeat

            <p>
                Erik ten Hag has criticised Manchester United's defending in their recent defeat tot Arsenal United were unable to hold out for a draw after they conceded a late winner from forward Eddie Nketiah 'Maybe in the next couple of hours we realise we are in a good position, realise we are in a good development, a good process, but at this moment I am annoyed,' the Dutchman said

                Especially the last goal, you have to feel the game on that point.  'A point was the maximum and then you have to take the point and you can't give such a goal away like we did on top level

                Then you can't win trophies.' ten Hag admitted his side 'cannot win trophies' if they don't change their mentality in games United's defenders, including Luke Shaw (right), struggled to contain the Gunners' attack United slipped to fourth in the table after the defeat but have been on a good run of form of late and look good to finish in the top four, despite half of the season still left to play

                (Bloomberg) -- Ken Griffin’s Citadel churned out a record $16 billion in profit for clients last year, outperforming the rest of the industry and one of history’s most successful financial plays
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citadel’s gain was the largest annual return for a hedge fund manager, surpassing the $15 billion that John Paulson generated in 2007 on his bet against subprime mortgages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it’s a different story outside the industry giants, with hedge funds overall losing $208 billion last year as many managers found themselves on the wrong side of global market turmoil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The findings also reflect the growing clout of multistrategy hedge fund firms, which are on the cusp of taking over equity-focused funds to become the dominant strategy in the industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LCH estimated that the industry has produced gains in excess of $1.4 trillion for clients since inception
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The top 20 managers, which oversaw almost 19% of the industry assets, produced $692 billion of that profit, or 49% of the total

                Liverpool is reportedly interested in signing a young defender who fits the FSG model, and has compared himself to Virgil van Dijk — not without reason
            </p>

            <p>
                And it seems like one player who Liverpool could be targeting is a center-back, which would make sense considering two of the club's senior defenders in Virgil van Dijk and Joël Matip are entering their twilight years

                Bångsbo has won 70.1 per cent of his 3.88 defensive duels per 90 in his debut season for his club

            <p>
                He has also averaged 4.63 interceptions and 9.56 recoveries per 90 as per Wyscout

                Liverpool is reportedly interested in signing a young defender who fits the FSG model, and has compared himself to Virgil van Dijk — not without reason
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool is still very much keeping an eye on the best prospects from abroad

            <p>
                And it seems like one player who Liverpool could be targeting is a center-back, which would make sense considering two of the club's senior defenders in Virgil van Dijk and Joël Matip are entering their twilight years

                Harvey Elliott provided a rare moment of quality in the first-half of Liverpool's clash with Chelsea as his impressive skill got the crowd on their feet as he left Hakim Ziyech chasing him Harvey Elliott had the Anfield crown purring as he left Hakim Ziyech for dead with an impressive show of skill
