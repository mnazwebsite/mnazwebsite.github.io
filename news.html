                Guinea-Bissau's Mama Balde scored the only goal as they stunned Nigeria with a 1-0 win in their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Abuja, while Morocco became the first team to book their place in the finals on Friday without kicking a ball

                Balde's first-half goal was decisive against a Nigeria team packed with in-form attackers, including Serie A leading scorer Victor Osimhen, as Guinea-Bissau moved top of Group A with seven points from three games

            <p>

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 24 ― The good appraisal by the Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Almarhum Sultan Iskandar on the credibility and leadership of Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as prime minister shows the confidence of the royal institution on the reformation being carried out by the government

            <p>
                “With extensive experience on matters of federalism, the statement by the Sultan shows that the Unity Government led by Anwar is already on a very good track and is seen as a government capable of driving the country's growth and progress back on the right track,” he told Bernama

            <p>
                Commenting further, the Razak Faculty of Technology and Informatics senior lecturer said the statement by the Sultan of Johor may also take into account opportunities and effects from a commercial and economic point of view for the state of Johor, the effect of the good relationship between the federal government and the state that has been built

            <p>
                Questions have been asked over the German manager's future at Liverpool following a lacklustre season to date, which already sees them out of every domestic and European cup competition while scrapping to finish in the Premier League's top four at the end of the campaign

            <p>
                The Belgian manager has arguably had the Seagulls playing better than his predecessor did in recent months as he aims to wrap up an impressive first year in England by guiding the club to European qualification at the end of the campaign.Klopp has already been terrorised by De Zerbi this season when Liverpool were dismantled by Brighton on two occasions in the space of a month back in January, when they were beaten in the Premier League and FA Cup

                About Us Advertise NEW DELHI, March 24 — Top opposition figure Rahul Gandhi was expelled from India’s parliament today, a day after his defamation conviction for a remark seen as an insult against Prime Minister Narendra Modi

            <p>
                Gandhi, 52, is the leading face of the Congress party, once the dominant force of Indian politics, with a proud role in ending British colonial rule, but now a shadow of its former self
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thursday’s case stemmed from a remark made during the 2019 election campaign in which Gandhi had asked why “all thieves have Modi as (their) common surname”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indira Gandhi, Rahul’s grandmother, was briefly forced out of the chamber by a court decision in 1977 while she was prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But legal action has been widely deployed against opposition party figures and institutions seen as critical of the Modi government in recent years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sisodia’s party is seeking to supplant Congress as the main opposition to Modi’s government and its members have decried his arrest as politically motivated

                About Us Advertise NEW DELHI, March 24 — Top opposition figure Rahul Gandhi was expelled from India’s parliament today, a day after his defamation conviction for a remark seen as an insult against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gandhi, 52, is the leading face of the Congress party, once the dominant force of Indian politics, with a proud role in ending British colonial rule, but now a shadow of its former self
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thursday’s case stemmed from a remark made during the 2019 election campaign in which Gandhi had asked why “all thieves have Modi as (their) common surname”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indira Gandhi, Rahul’s grandmother, was briefly forced out of the chamber by a court decision in 1977 while she was prime minister
            </p>

                But legal action has been widely deployed against opposition party figures and institutions seen as critical of the Modi government in recent years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sisodia’s party is seeking to supplant Congress as the main opposition to Modi’s government and its members have decried his arrest as politically motivated

            <p>
                Leissner described the person to be Rohana, and that he bought the property in London, after she allegedly threatened to expose his involvement in 1MDB

            <p>
                As a result, Rohana was summoned to the MACC in February last year

                Liverpool is expected to be heavily involved in the race to sign Jude Bellingham this summer but if the chance to sign one Barcelona talented teenager comes up, they must take it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bellingham may well be the hottest young property in Europe currently but there is no doubt that Gavi, who beat the former Birmingham City teenager to the European Golden Boy award last year, would very quickly run him close if there is no resolve to a ruling which could come into effect in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In effect, this will mean that a release clause will come back into effect that would theoretically allow him to depart Camp Nou for free this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Intriguingly, both players may well end up becoming available for free this summer and, while recent World Cup winner Messi may be out of the reach of a host of elite clubs, it does not seem beyond the realms of possibility that Gavi could be within the reach of Premier League clubs such as Liverpool
            </p>

                The prospect of signing a league-winning midfielder this summer would be a tantalizing one for most Liverpool supporters but to get one of such inalienable talent for free would be nothing short of a coup

            <p>
                Jude Bellingham may well end up dominating the headlines this summer but, in Gavi, there is no doubt that an elite club could pick up the biggest bargain in years in the upcoming transfer window

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 24 — The High Court here today fixed four days starting November 6 to hear Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi’s suit against Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad over allegations that Ahmad Zahid used his position to influence the latter to interfere in Ahmad Zahid’s ongoing criminal cases in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Mior Nor Haidir Suhaimi, representing former prime minister Dr Mahathir, said deputy registrar Nor Afidah Idris set November 6 to 9 for the trial and April 14 for case management before the hearing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The trial will be heard by Judge Datuk Rozana Ali Yusoff at 10am,” said the counsel after the matter came up for case management via online today

            </p>

                About Us Advertise PARIS, March 24 — Transgender women will no longer be allowed to compete in female track and field events regardless of their levels of testosterone, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said Thursday, citing fairness over inclusion

            <p>
                Coe said no transgender athlete who had gone through male puberty would be permitted to compete in female world ranking competitions from March 31

            <p>
                “In these circumstances, the Council decided to prioritise fairness and the integrity of the female competition before inclusion.” World Athletics’ ruling follows that of Fina, swimming’s world governing body, which has stopped transgender swimmers who had gone through male puberty from competing in women’s elite races

                World Rugby, in 2020, was the first international sports federation to rule that transgender male-to-females could not compete at the elite and international level of the women’s game

                In a heartfelt interview, Eddie Jordan said that the constant battle and pressure have left Corinna almost like a "prisoner."  He said that privacy is such a vital aspect of sports, business, and personal life, and he understands why Corinna refuses to allow people outside their immediate circle to visit Michael

            <p>
                Schumacher was given his big chance by Eddie aged 22 at the Belgian Grand Prix in 1991, and it was an extraordinary set of circumstances in which Jordan driver Bertrand Gachot couldn't make the race as he was jailed for 18 months after spraying a taxi driver with CS gas

                The motor is sandwiched between the engine and eight-speed automatic gearbox, driving all four wheels through a rear-biased M xDrive all-wheel-drive system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latter includes the standard 4WD mode and the 4WD Sport that sends even more power to the rear wheels

            <p>
                Also fitted is the Adaptive M Suspension Professional with variable dampers and active anti-roll bars, along with rear-wheel steering—a BMW M first
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a showcase model for the BMW M lineup, the XM’s aesthetic is as extroverted as they come, with very angular styling and some novel design cues

            <p>
                The BMW Curved Display sits on a carbon fibre base and consists of a 12.3-inch instrument display and a 14.9-inch touchscreen, the latter also incorporating the air-con controls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It runs on the latest BMW Operating System 8 and, unlike some other BMW models sold in Malaysia, comes with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard

                While four-cylinder middleweight sports bikes are not new, the 1990’s seeing a whole slew of multi-cylinder lightweights from the Japanese manufacturers, the ZX-4R is the only one in its class

            <p>
                Launched last February in a worldwide online debut, the ZX-4R goes against the grain of the current trend of two-cylinder sports bikes like the Aprilia RS660 and Yamaha R7, alongside its own Kawasaki siblings, the Ninja 400 and Ninja 600

            <p>
                So, why a four cylinder sports bike in this day and age of tightening emissions and noise regulations with the safety brigade hand wringing and moaning about motorcycle rider accident statistics? For one, multi-cylinder motorcycles are smoother due to better (not perfect) primary balance in the engine

            <p>
                And having the ability to spank that engine to its 15,000 rpm redline results in a something like a howl from an animal on the hunt

            <p>
                And you have to give it to Kawasaki for having the sheer guts to produce a motorcycle in these enlightened times that is about speed and performance and looks and little else

            <p>
                This came after some politicians had given religious lectures or classes and led Friday prayers without the council’s approval.  “Therefore, MAIDAM has decided to disallow all state assemblymen, Members of Parliament (MPs), and senators from delivering any religious lectures in mosques and surau in Terengganu,” said MAIDAM president Shaikh Harun Shaikh Ismail.  He added that all political leaders and activists are also not allowed to lead and deliver the Friday sermon in mosques as well as deliver religious talks without the council's permission
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even prophets gave political sermons,” he told reporters in Marang, Terengganu on Mar 4.  “What is wrong, we must speak up about it
