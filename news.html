                Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd head of economics and market analysis Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said one of the voting members for the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Neil Kashkari, indicated that he was open to a 25 basis points hike (bps) or 50 bps in the upcoming meeting in March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, non-voting member Raphel Bostic suggested the Fed funds rate should be in the range of 5.00 per cent to 5.25 per cent, and that such a level needs to be held steady well into 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, Mohd Afzanizam foresees the ringgit to remain rangebound against the greenback ahead of the FOMC meeting in mid-March
            </p>

                The ringgit also traded higher against some Asean currencies

                Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd head of economics and market analysis Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said one of the voting members for the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Neil Kashkari, indicated that he was open to a 25 basis points hike (bps) or 50 bps in the upcoming meeting in March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, non-voting member Raphel Bostic suggested the Fed funds rate should be in the range of 5.00 per cent to 5.25 per cent, and that such a level needs to be held steady well into 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, Mohd Afzanizam foresees the ringgit to remain rangebound against the greenback ahead of the FOMC meeting in mid-March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ringgit also traded higher against some Asean currencies

                Reading his witness statement, Swampillai said SRC International had initiated the use of fiduciary funds in 2011
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Within a fairly short period of time, these fiduciary fund transactions were also undertaken by various related and affiliated companies, such as 1MDB, Brazen Sky Ltd and Aabar BVI, which also became clients of BSI,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Investments in fiduciary funds are often directed by the investor (client), and the fund manager’s role is to carry out the client’s instructions by implementing those instructions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is unlike traditional investment funds, where investments are decided and managed by the fund managers on a discretionary basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness also said the origins of the use of such fiduciary funds by companies such as 1MDB, SRC, Brazen Sky and Aabar could be traced back to a meeting he had in 2011 with fugitive businessman, Low Taek Jho, or better known as Jho Low, who had inquired about the inner workings of fiduciary funds with BSI
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Low had told BSI on numerous occasions that he was an adviser to Najib, which Swampillai had heard from his superiors

                MIKEL ARTETA says Arsenal have sent out a title statement after opening up  a five-point lead at the top of the Premier League

                “The timing of the two goals just before-half was key and after that we grew and deserved to win the game.” Everton had started a serious Arsenal wobble last month when his side notched a shock-and-awe win over Mikel Arteta’s men in his first game.  Defeat on Merseyside on February 4 had sparked a run of just one point from a possible nine as Arsenal briefly lost the leadership to Manchester City

                With two years left until the completion of the Education Ministry’s Roadmap for English Language Education in Malaysia (2015-2025) reform plan, stakeholders say more needs to be done
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, more dual language programme schools need to open up for the English language to be applied even more in the classroom,” she said yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jobs, she said, required skills, and having a command of the English language was an asset to any potential employer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Highly Immersive Programme is specified in the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025 and is aimed at solving the poor language proficiency problem among students by involving and immersing them in an English language environment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Just strictly enforce the immersive and dual language programme, where students can opt for Mathematics and Science in English, and the level of English education will be enhanced,” Mak added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The English language requirement in the job market depends on the company’s needs; some don’t stress having fluency in English, but of course, a strong grasp of the language is still seen as an extra advantage,” she said

                With two years left until the completion of the Education Ministry’s Roadmap for English Language Education in Malaysia (2015-2025) reform plan, stakeholders say more needs to be done
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, more dual language programme schools need to open up for the English language to be applied even more in the classroom,” she said yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jobs, she said, required skills, and having a command of the English language was an asset to any potential employer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Highly Immersive Programme is specified in the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025 and is aimed at solving the poor language proficiency problem among students by involving and immersing them in an English language environment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Just strictly enforce the immersive and dual language programme, where students can opt for Mathematics and Science in English, and the level of English education will be enhanced,” Mak added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The English language requirement in the job market depends on the company’s needs; some don’t stress having fluency in English, but of course, a strong grasp of the language is still seen as an extra advantage,” she said
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                That meant not just Klopp but Liverpool fans too got to witness the Portuguese international in action, and there's been plenty to admire
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's a complete midfielder, and Julen Lopetegui's decision to take him off was surely a relief to Liverpool's midfield

            <p>
                Liverpool hasn't had that kind of energetic box-to-box midfielder since the Dutchman left on a free contract

                More young adults are choosing to live at home with their parents — but many of them are using what they're saving on rent to splurge on designer handbags and expensive jewelry instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the hosts of The Ramsey Show claim these adult children are being “enabled” and “coddled,” many simply can't afford to live on their own in the current economic climate

                There are many practical benefits to living with your parents, but it’s important that you also use this time to work toward your goals, like becoming financially independent

            <p>
                You may have more room for discretionary spending, but your money could be better spent elsewhere, like investing it in the stock market, even if it’s just a few dollars at a time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you're planning to buy instead of rent when you move out, experts generally recommend saving 20% of the home’s purchase price for the down payment, however this can be challenging for many first-timers, especially as home prices have continued to rise

                More young adults are choosing to live at home with their parents — but many of them are using what they're saving on rent to splurge on designer handbags and expensive jewelry instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the hosts of The Ramsey Show claim these adult children are being “enabled” and “coddled,” many simply can't afford to live on their own in the current economic climate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are many practical benefits to living with your parents, but it’s important that you also use this time to work toward your goals, like becoming financially independent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The problem is you’ve got debt, you’re not earning enough money and you’re not doing enough to go out and change it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You may have more room for discretionary spending, but your money could be better spent elsewhere, like investing it in the stock market, even if it’s just a few dollars at a time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you're planning to buy instead of rent when you move out, experts generally recommend saving 20% of the home’s purchase price for the down payment, however this can be challenging for many first-timers, especially as home prices have continued to rise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chances are good you're overpaying for home insurance

                CelcomDigi has announced an extension of its free 5G access offer for eligible Celcom and Digi customers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To access the 5G network, customers on eligible Digi Postpaid and Prepaid customers will have to purchase a new 5G Booster for RM10 per month from the MyDigi app
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As an introductory offer, the monthly fee for 5G is waived for all activations during the free trial access period from today until 30th April 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similar to Digi, Celcom customers who are currently enjoying free 5G trial access on Celcom MEGA postpaid, Xpax Postpaid and Xpax Prepaid can still enjoy the free access until 30th April 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We still don’t know how much Celcom postpaid and prepaid customers will have to pay to continue to enjoy 5G from May onwards

                The Prime Minister applauded Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr for making great strides to ensure the peace process in Mindanao would be successful

                According to Anwar, there are immense opportunities to be reaped by both countries should efforts to attain peace in Mindanao succeed

            <p>
                The Philippines, according to him, recognised the great contribution that Malaysia had made to the peace process in southern Philippines

                He hoped the support shown by Malaysia would continue to contribute to the success of the peace process and the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region

                The Prime Minister applauded Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr for making great strides to ensure the peace process in Mindanao would be successful
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The peace process has to succeed, because it not only affects the Philippines and Malaysia but also the region," he said at a joint press briefing after holding a bilateral meeting with Marcos at Malacanang Palace here Wednesday (March 1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister said Malaysia remained committed to playing a constructive role in the peace process in Mindanao
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Anwar, there are immense opportunities to be reaped by both countries should efforts to attain peace in Mindanao succeed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Philippines, according to him, recognised the great contribution that Malaysia had made to the peace process in southern Philippines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He hoped the support shown by Malaysia would continue to contribute to the success of the peace process and the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “TAP was formed as an initiative to give the legends of the game a chance to contribute to the sport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Norza chaired the first of the quarterly TAP meeting where five of the seven former internationals – Datuk Cheah Soon Kit, Ong Ewe Hock, Koo Kien Keat, Tan Boon Heong and Roslin Hashim – attended the meeting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ewe Hock, who often speaks his mind when it comes to the performance of the national shuttlers, welcomed the move where the former internationals can give back to the sport in more effective way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is a good move by BAM to invite us to be part of the panel where we can give our views and contribute ideas to help Malaysia to produce greater results,” said Ewe Hock

                Kevin, 58, is the former head of Wealth Management Services at BSI Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 44th prosecution witness in the trial, he testified to how Jho Low had heaped pressure on BSI bank over the transfers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An example of such haste by Jho Low involved 1MDB Global Investment Ltd (1MDBGIL), a 1MDB linked company which opened a bank account with BSI Bank and parked its funds under fiduciary funds under Jho Low, before transferring the money out to bank accounts linked to him elsewhere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kevin then testified of how approximately US$2.721 billion had entered 1MDBGIL’s fiduciary fund account and how most of it was transferred out at the behest of Jho Low the very next day through several transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In fact, various employees in BSI bank were put under tremendous pressure by the clients (specifically, the pressure was applied by Jho Low on Yak, who in turn pressured various departments in the bank) to expedite processes, so that the money flow from 1MDBGIL (and other 1MDB related client accounts) was transferred as quickly as possible from the BSI bank account to the account of the fiduciary fund and then on to the account of the target company,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because Jho Low had rushed these transactions, from the US$2.721 billion, a sum of US$1,060,606,065 was paid into the account of two other fiduciary funds with BSI under Jho Low, namely Devonshire Funds Ltd and EEMF

                “Out of the 148 MPs supporting the unity government, more than half or 77 are Muslim MPs, dispelling the false narrative that the unity government is dominated by non-Muslim MPs,” Lim said

                Two weeks ago, Hadi decried that the unity government consisted of more non-Muslims than Muslims

                He said calling it a unity government was misleading

            <p>
                Hadi said the unity government does not have an opposition or the opposition is too small like a mosquito

            <p>
                Lim, however, rebuked this statement by stating that the 77 Muslim MPs in the unity government contrast with the 72 out of 74 Perikatan Nasional (PN) MPs who are Muslims

                “Out of the 148 MPs supporting the unity government, more than half or 77 are Muslim MPs, dispelling the false narrative that the unity government is dominated by non-Muslim MPs,” Lim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two weeks ago, Hadi decried that the unity government consisted of more non-Muslims than Muslims

            <p>
                He said calling it a unity government was misleading
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hadi said the unity government does not have an opposition or the opposition is too small like a mosquito
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim, however, rebuked this statement by stating that the 77 Muslim MPs in the unity government contrast with the 72 out of 74 Perikatan Nasional (PN) MPs who are Muslims
            </p>

                According to him, in other countries, when the people’s income reached a level that is high, a majority of the people would pay income tax

            <p>
                He explained that when the government switched from income tax to GST, the income tax rate would be reduced because the transition to GST is not to collect additional tax but because it is a better approach to collect tax

                Then, even after you have accepted that an electric car could be your next car, there’s the concern of aftersales support for Tesla cars in Malaysia

                I have never heard of an unrepairable Tesla based on my lurking in Tesla owner groups

            <p>
                Currently there is 7% VAT tax and 2% excise tax for tesla sold in thailand

            <p>

                “If T20 (top 20 per cent income group) was not given petrol, diesel and LPG subsidy, the amount saved is between RM15 billion (US$ 3.3 billion) and RM17 billion, so Honourable Members please imagine how many other items we can use to assist the people in various matters in 26 ministries,” said the deputy minister.  He explained that out of the RM50.8 billion spent by the government on petrol, diesel and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) subsidies in 2022, 35 per cent - or RM17 billion - had benefitted the T20.  Meanwhile, the lowest income group (B40) accounted for only 24 per cent, while the middle-income group (M40) used 41 per cent.  Mr Ahmad was responding to a parliamentary query by Kuala Terengganu Member of Parliament (MP) Ahmad Amzad Hashim, who asked how those from the M40 who dropped down to the B40 group in the city areas will receive the benefits of targeted subsidies if they are put in place

                The deputy minister also pointed out that diesel subsidies rose to RM8.4 billion in 2022 as compared to RM5.8 billion in 2018 and RM6.1 billion in 2019

                By Ambar Warrick Investing.com--Chinese business activity grew more than expected in February, rising past pre-COVID levels as an economic recovery in the country gained momentum after the relaxing of most anti-COVID restrictions this year.  The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’s Index (PMI) rose 52.6 in February, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday

            <p>
                The figure was higher than expectations for a reading of 50.5, and January’s figure of 50.1.  China’s Non-manufacturing PMI fared far better, rising 56.3 in February- more than expectations for growth of 55.0, and well above than the prior month’s reading of 54.4

                The Caixin Manufacturing PMI read 51.6 for the month, more than expectations of 50.2 and well above the 49.2 seen in January.  The survey, which focuses on smaller, private industries, indicates that a manufacturing recovery was broad-based in February.  “Both manufacturing supply and demand expanded last month, as production gradually returned to normal while both domestic and external demand improved after a COVID policy shift," Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group said in a note.   The non-manufacturing sector was boosted by pent-up demand for services after three years of zero-COVID

                By Ambar Warrick Investing.com -- Chinese business activity grew more than expected in February, rising past pre-COVID levels as an economic recovery in the country gained momentum after the relaxing of most anti-COVID restrictions this year.  The manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose 52.6 in February, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The figure was higher than expectations for a reading of 50.5, and January’s figure of 50.1.  China’s non-manufacturing PMI fared far better, rising 56.3 in February - more than expectations for growth of 55.0, and well above than the prior month’s reading of 54.4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Strength in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity saw China’s composite PMI jump 56.4 in February - its fastest pace in over three years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A separate, private survey also showed that China’s manufacturing sector rebounded in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Caixin Manufacturing PMI read 51.6 for the month, more than expectations of 50.2 and well above the 49.2 seen in January.  The survey, which focuses on smaller, private industries, indicates that a manufacturing recovery was broad-based in February.  “Both manufacturing supply and demand expanded last month, as production gradually returned to normal while both domestic and external demand improved after a COVID policy shift," Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group said in a note.   The non-manufacturing sector was boosted by pent-up demand for services after three years of zero-COVID

                The victim's son who spoke on the condition of anonymity claimed that his father had confronted the two men for causing a nuisance by playing music loudly inside their vehicle at about 2.45am on Monday (Feb 27)

            <p>
                As such, it is likely that Liverpool could add more established midfielders to its squad ahead of next season — especially with rumored top target in this area of the pitch, Jude Bellingham, being only 19

                Thiago will be 32 by the start of the next campaign and is out of contract at the end of next season and it would make perfect sense for the Reds to be forward-planning at this stage

                In many ways, this would represent the kind of astute foresight which paid such dividends for Liverpool during early days of Klopp at the club.

                Dr Wee, who is MCA president, also suggested gradually increasing the proposed RM12,000 individual relief to RM15,000 in three years

                “This will help Malaysians, particularly the B40 and M40, who are affected by inflation,” he added

            <p>

                Dr Wee commended the government for allocating RM1bil in Budget 2023 to provide RM500 to each of the two million Employees Provident Fund (EPF) aged 40 to 54 who have less than RM10,000 in their Account 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said he was concerned that there were two million people in this age group who had less than RM10,000 in their EPF
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Wee said the government must accurately identify “target groups” in its plans to give the RM500 EPF contribution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In addition, the RM500 contribution should not include inactive EPF members, as they may no longer reside in Malaysia or they may be a permanent resident, who should not be accepting the contribution.”

                At the moment, Kvara does not want to make ant statements about his future but the feeling is clear - in Italy he will only be playing for Napoli or will accept a lucrative contract from abroad.  These are exceptionally good times for Napoli but the player may be tempted by a big move Both Kvaratskhelia and striker Victor Osimhen will have plenty of interest come the summer It would be impossible to imagine Kvara in Napoli until 2028 but if the player accepted the renewal of the contract, his raised market value would only favour the club

                Australia’s Avalon International Air Show, which began April 28, exhibits a wide range of new defense technologies, including a new Australian-made lethal drone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unmanned aerial technology is already establishing itself as a major air show theme
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Designed to be transported in shipping containers, the uncrewed air system was created by BAE Systems Australia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The designers of this UAV believe that the deadly drone may be produced locally within three years.  The STRIX, developed by BAE Systems and Perth-based Innovaero, is Australia’s first domestically designed, manufactured, and armed VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) uncrewed air system (UAS), according to the company.  The firm said that the partnership merges Innovaero’s experience in designing and manufacturing aerospace products for the Australian market with BAE Systems’ expertise in autonomous platforms and its vehicle management system (VMS) technology
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The RAZER precision-guided munition transforms a normal non-guided munition weighing 40 to 50 kg into a low-cost, high-precision air-launched weapon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another Australian-designed uncrewed system, called MQ-28A ‘Ghost Bat,’ was publicly unveiled during the 2019 Avalon Airshow after being discreetly developed by aerospace giant Boeing in cooperation with the RAAF and the Defense Department.

                Australia’s Avalon International Air Show, which began April 28, exhibits a wide range of new defense technologies, including a new Australian-made lethal drone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unmanned aerial technology is already establishing itself as a major air show theme
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Designed to be transported in shipping containers, the uncrewed air system was created by BAE Systems Australia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The designers of this UAV believe that the deadly drone may be produced locally within three years.  The STRIX, developed by BAE Systems and Perth-based Innovaero, is Australia’s first domestically designed, manufactured, and armed VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) uncrewed air system (UAS), according to the company.  The firm said that the partnership merges Innovaero’s experience in designing and manufacturing aerospace products for the Australian market with BAE Systems’ expertise in autonomous platforms and its vehicle management system (VMS) technology
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The RAZER precision-guided munition transforms a normal non-guided munition weighing 40 to 50 kg into a low-cost, high-precision air-launched weapon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another Australian-designed uncrewed system, called MQ-28A ‘Ghost Bat,’ was publicly unveiled during the 2019 Avalon Airshow after being discreetly developed by aerospace giant Boeing in cooperation with the RAAF and the Defense Department.

                What Are RMDs? You don’t pay taxes on the money in your IRA or 401(k) when you put it in, which is why these accounts are considered tax-advantaged retirement accounts

                David Moyes has provided an injury update on his West Ham squad before facing Manchester United in the FA Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no time for United to celebrate Sunday’s EFL Cup win over Newcastle, as they are straight back into action at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At his pre-match press conference, Moyes spoke about the injuries Lukasz Fabianski and Vladimir Coufal picked up in Saturday’s 4-0 win over Nottingham Forest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Vladimir Coufal has got a heel injury that will keep him out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is a boost for United but they cannot take this game lightly, as they were reliant on David de Gea to preserve a 1-0 Premier League win earlier this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That means you would expect this game to be another tight one, with United needing to get right back to serious business after basking in the glow of Sunday’s Wembley triumph.

                David Moyes has provided an injury update on his West Ham squad before facing Manchester United in the FA Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no time for United to celebrate Sunday’s EFL Cup win over Newcastle, as they are straight back into action at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At his pre-match press conference, Moyes spoke about the injuries Lukasz Fabianski and Vladimir Coufal picked up in Saturday’s 4-0 win over Nottingham Forest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Vladimir Coufal has got a heel injury that will keep him out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is a boost for United but they cannot take this game lightly, as they were reliant on David de Gea to preserve a 1-0 Premier League win earlier this season
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The accused, Wan Maseri Wan Mohd, 59, is alleged to have committed the act at a house in Kampung Nuri Balai Panjang, Johol, Kuala Pilah at about 9.45am yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The charges were framed under Section 52 of the Syariah Criminal Enactment (Negeri Sembilan) 1992 (2019 Amendment) which provides for a fine not exceeding RM5,000 or imprisonment for not more than three years, or both Earlier, Deputy Chief Syarie Prosecutor Rohaizad Redzuan requested the court to impose bail at RM8,000 with a civil servant in surety, taking into account that the teachings of the accused had spread widely through social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday (Feb 28) the accused along with 17 women aged between 20 and 60, were arrested by the Negeri Sembilan Islamic Religious Affairs Department (JHEAINS) during a 'lecture session’ at a house in Johol
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, at the Kuala Pilah Syariah Lower Court, the accused was fined RM3,000 and imprisoned for a year after she pleaded guilty to the charge of teaching without a certificate from the Credentials Committee under Section 118(3) of the Negeri Sembilan Islamic Religious Administration Enactment 2003

                More info Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag is hoping to beat Chelsea to the signings of two high-profile targets before the start of next season, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United are said to be looking to strengthen in a number of positions when the bidding opens at the end of the campaign, with Ten Hag desperate to reinforce his existing squad in preparation for his second season in charge at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has already insisted that he is keen to avoid making the same mistakes United did before his arrival at the club, which saw them spend hundreds of millions on players without too much of a return on their investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Manchester United didn't exactly have the fear factor last season," Ten Hag told Voetbal International in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I saw that as an outsider and also noticed it in my first weeks at the club."I looked at the culture of the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Most purchases have been average and at United average is not good enough, United's shirt weighs heavily

                More info Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag is hoping to beat Chelsea to the signings of two high-profile targets before the start of next season, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United are said to be looking to strengthen in a number of positions when the bidding opens at the end of the campaign, with Ten Hag desperate to reinforce his existing squad in preparation for his second season in charge at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has already insisted that he is keen to avoid making the same mistakes United did before his arrival at the club, which saw them spend hundreds of millions on players without too much of a return on their investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Manchester United didn't exactly have the fear factor last season," Ten Hag told Voetbal International in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I saw that as an outsider and also noticed it in my first weeks at the club."I looked at the culture of the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Most purchases have been average and at United average is not good enough, United's shirt weighs heavily

                About Us Advertise   KOTA KINABALU, Feb 28 — Even with the vision of a Sabah “unity government” to mirror the federal government no longer on the cards, prime minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has today praised chief minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor for out-manoeuvring his political nemeses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, on his first official visit to Sabah as prime minister, said he was impressed with the soft-spoken Hajiji’s political astuteness that has stabilised the state’s political landscape with his two-thirds majority in the state government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Later, when asked about his desire to form a similar coalition government in Sabah, Anwar said that it was at the end of the day, the prerogative of the state government to decide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Anwar administration is a coalition between Pakatan Harapan, Barisan Nasional, Gabungan Parti Sarawak and Gabungan Rakyat Sabah, which is leading the state government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 6, Hajiji’s position as chief minister was undermined when Sabah Umno chief Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin pulled the plug on their relationship with the GRS government, which caused Hajiji to lose the majority he had to form the state Cabinet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, although endorsing Hajiji as chief minister, said that he hoped the state would come to a consensus that was similar to a unity government

                Liverpool want Chelsea star N'Golo Kante, according to new reports, as part of their epic summer rebuild Liverpool are targeting Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante, in what would be a surprise move to bolster their midfield.  The Reds are looking towards the future with an influx of talent expected to rejuvenate the side this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool, however, might be in a better position to offer a deal the 31-year-old is keen on.  Liverpool want to bring in an expensive talent in Bellingham – and are in the market for Josko Gvardiol (opens in new tab) and Antonio Silva (opens in new tab) – so a free transfer could help them to add another player to their squad, while building elsewhere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since there, he has won the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kante is valued at around €30m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).  Jurgen Klopp has addressed the "clear need" for a Liverpool rebuild this summer – and reports suggest there could be a lot of money spent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Josko Gvardiol is a top target, with Mason Mount on the wishlist, too. Seven other players are in the summer plans, with an eye on the future as well

                Liverpool want Chelsea star N'Golo Kante, according to new reports, as part of their epic summer rebuild Liverpool are targeting Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante, in what would be a surprise move to bolster their midfield.  The Reds are looking towards the future with an influx of talent expected to rejuvenate the side this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool, however, might be in a better position to offer a deal the 31-year-old is keen on.  Liverpool want to bring in an expensive talent in Bellingham – and are in the market for Josko Gvardiol (opens in new tab) and Antonio Silva (opens in new tab) – so a free transfer could help them to add another player to their squad, while building elsewhere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since there, he has won the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kante is valued at around €30m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).  Jurgen Klopp has addressed the "clear need" for a Liverpool rebuild this summer – and reports suggest there could be a lot of money spent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Josko Gvardiol is a top target, with Mason Mount on the wishlist, too. Seven other players are in the summer plans, with an eye on the future as well

                Malaysian Health Minister Zaliha Mustafa
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a written reply to a parliamentary question, Dr Zaliha said that among the steps taken by her ministry to increase the number of medical officers in Malaysia include expediting the appointment process of all medical graduates by omitting the interview process conducted by the Public Services Commission
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other measures include increasing the graduate training slots at the health ministry as well as reappointing retired medical officers on a contractual basis, said Dr Zaliha.  She added that the health ministry is also encouraging Malaysian specialists working overseas to return home and serve the country.  Dr Zaliha was responding to a question from Puchong Member of Parliament Yeo Bee Yin, who had asked the health ministry on the steps it has taken to overcome the issue of manpower in hospitals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The issue came under the spotlight more recently after local media reports highlighted issues of hospitals overflowing with patients and long waiting times at emergency departments.  Dr Zaliha on Monday said that there were 59,651 medical officers with the health ministry last year, a 6.6 per cent increase compared to the 55,973 in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Zaliha noted that based on annual trends, 70 per cent of medical officers work in the public sector while the remaining 30 per cent are in the private sector.  As for nurses, the health minister said that 60 per cent of the 115,230 nurses in Malaysia serve under the health ministry.  Separately, Deputy Prime Minister Fadillah Yusof told parliament on Tuesday that congestion at government hospitals was an indication about the improvement of the country’s healthcare system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is why the government hospital has become a focus (for people to visit),” said Mr Fadillah.  The deputy prime minister added that the overcrowding at the public hospitals also shows that Malaysians are not practising a healthy lifestyle.  “That is why more people need to go to a doctor and why the health ministry has emphasised the promotion of living healthily

                Najib’s bid for the Federal Court review concluded after a hearing that spanned over six days from January 19 until today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rule 137 of the Rules of the Federal Court 1995 recognises the Federal Court’s inherent power to review its previous decisions in order to prevent an injustice or an abuse of process, and it has been mostly used to set aside Federal Court’s decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s defence have indicated there are four grounds for the review that they want the apex court to reconsider namely; a review of the Federal Court’s earlier decision to reject the defence’s application to adduce further evidence concerning the SRC trial judge, a review of the apex court’s decision on the same day to dismiss Najib’s bid to postpone his appeal hearing, a review of the court’s decision to reject Najib’s application to recuse the Chief Justice and a review of the August 2022 decision by the five-member bench to affirm Najib’s conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A five-member panel presided over today’s hearing with Abdul Rahman leading Federal Court judges Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, and Datuk Nordin Hassan, as well as Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abu Bakar Jais

                Following his incarceration last year, Najib sought to challenge the Federal Court’s August 2022 unanimous decision in affirming his conviction, sentence and fine meted out by the High Court for the misappropriation of RM42 million of SRC International Sdn Bhd fund

                Najib’s bid for the Federal Court review concluded after a hearing that spanned over six days from January 19 until today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rule 137 of the Rules of the Federal Court 1995 recognises the Federal Court’s inherent power to review its previous decisions in order to prevent an injustice or an abuse of process, and it has been mostly used to set aside Federal Court’s decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s defence have indicated there are four grounds for the review that they want the apex court to reconsider namely; a review of the Federal Court’s earlier decision to reject the defence’s application to adduce further evidence concerning the SRC trial judge, a review of the apex court’s decision on the same day to dismiss Najib’s bid to postpone his appeal hearing, a review of the court’s decision to reject Najib’s application to recuse the Chief Justice and a review of the August 2022 decision by the five-member bench to affirm Najib’s conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A five-member panel presided over today’s hearing with Abdul Rahman leading Federal Court judges Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, and Datuk Nordin Hassan, as well as Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abu Bakar Jais

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 28 — Minister of Economy Rafizi Ramli said today the government could reinstate the goods and services tax eventually
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The GST cannot be approached just as a means to raise government income because once it is seen as a way to raise income, it becomes addictive,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If you don’t fix your governance, you don’t fix your spending and your effectiveness or efficiency of your budgeting, it’s very easy when you have GST — you just keep raising from initially five, then seven per cent and eventually it’ll be 20 (per cent)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There are a series of things that we need to put in place, so that once they are the decision to implement, GST is just a question of collection effectiveness..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has so far ruled out any prospect of reintroducing any new broad-based consumption tax, despite the alarm sounded by some conservative economists about the government’s high debt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The GST had been implemented under the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak in 2015 but was met with strong public backlash that was later credited as one of the key factors that caused his fall

                “The GST cannot be approached just as a means to raise government income because once it is seen as a way to raise income, it becomes addictive,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If you don’t fix your governance, you don’t fix your spending and your effectiveness or efficiency of your budgeting, it’s very easy when you have GST — you just keep raising from initially five, then seven per cent and eventually it’ll be 20 (per cent)
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                The GST had been implemented under the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak in 2015 but was met with strong public backlash that was later credited as one of the key factors that caused his fall

            <p>
                On July 20 last year, Dr Mahathir, 97, filed a lawsuit against Ahmad Zahid, 70, as a sole defendant, for allegedly issuing defamatory statements regarding the ‘kutty’ issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his statement of claim, Dr Mahathir claimed that Ahmad Zahid had issued a defamatory statement against him during Umno divisional meeting in Kelana Jaya on July 30, 2017, and the statement was reproduced on Astro Awani's YouTube and several online news portals, which can be accessed by internet users without any restrictions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir claimed that the slanderous statement meant that he was not born as a Malay or a Muslim with the alleged original name of "Mahathir son of Iskandar Kutty" and that he claimed to be a Malay when he became prime minister to gain political and personal advantage apart from belittling Malaysians of Indian Muslim descent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Ahmad Zahid in his statement of defence filed on Aug 17 last year through Messrs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Umno president claimed that the name "Mahathir son of Iskandar Kutty" refers to an individual based on the information in an old copy of an identity card, in addition to claiming that he also has no control over any video publication regarding his statement on the media platform

            <p>
                Ruslin said checks found that 13 of them had fake MyKad while one had the identity card of another person, also an offence under the law; all 29 had been remanded and would be charged soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Following the arrests, a follow-up check led to the arrest of 15 others with fake MyKad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “To avoid arrest, some tried to throw away their fake MyKad but our officers managed to stop them,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We believe this is the work of a syndicate that has been operating for some time, judging from how long those detained have had the fake MyKad in their possession,” he added

                Erik ten Hag masterminded another substitution masterstroke against Newcastle that allowed one Manchester United player to shine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That changed on Sunday in United’s League Cup final win over Newcastle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His selection ahead of Wan-Bissaka signalled that Ten Hag had an intention of attacking but Newcastle star Allan Saint-Maximin had him mostly backtracking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan-Bissaka put in seven tackles during his outing, the most out of any player on the pitch despite playing for just half of the game
            </p>

                Ahmad said it was estimated that the T20 group constituted about 35% or RM17.8bil of the amount

                Ahmad was responding to a supplementary question by Datuk Ahmad Amzad Hashim (PN-Kuala Terengganu), who asked if families who slipped from the M40 to B40 group will still benefit from government subsidies

                Earlier, Ahmad told the House that last year, a total of RM66.3bil was spent for various forms of subsidies in petrol, diesel, LPG, cooking oil and electricity, as well as chicken and eggs

                Ahmad said it was estimated that the T20 group constituted about 35% or RM17.8bil of the amount
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If we don’t want the T20 to receive subsidies for petrol, LPG and diesel, the government can save between RM15bil and RM17bil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad was responding to a supplementary question by Datuk Ahmad Amzad Hashim (PN-Kuala Terengganu), who asked if families who slipped from the M40 to B40 group will still benefit from government subsidies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Ahmad told the House that last year, a total of RM66.3bil was spent for various forms of subsidies in petrol, diesel, LPG, cooking oil and electricity, as well as chicken and eggs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad said subsidies had helped reduce the rise in cost of living

            <p>
                “Was it due to actual consumption or smuggling? “Because of that, we estimate that diesel is being smuggled, the same goes for RON95 petrol,” said Ahmad

                “This project is being funded by the Japanese government for five years until the end of fiscal year 2024 and after that, we will use the C4 for commercial production of various products from the microalgae biomass,” he said in an exclusive interview with The Borneo Post here yesterday

                Hoshino said the project is funded by the Japanese government to the tune of approximately 2.5 billion yen (more than RM80 million) to demonstrate the mass production of microalgae biomass throughout the year

                Microalgae biomass can be processed for various commercial applications such as jet fuel, plastic, paints, surfactants, truck fuel, proteins, feed and food products, as well as for pharmaceutical and cosmetics purposes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hoshino added that once bio-jet fuel – otherwise known as ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ – could be mass produced from microalgae biomass, they would eye exporting the product not only to Southeast Asian countries, but also to the United States and Europe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moreover, Hoshino highlighted that Sarawak was selected as a preferred location for the microalgae farm due to the ideal temperature throughout the year, abundance of fresh water, and the state being safe from major natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes

            <p>
                After sensing was something was wrong, thus he hung up the call and checked his account, only to find out that a withdrawal of the RM1 million had been made from his bank’s savings account without his authorisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then immediately called the bank to lodge a complaint and make a police report and became the latest victims to seek help from the Sarawak DAP over online banking scams

            <p>
                According to the special assistant to DAP Sarawak chairman Chong Chieng Jen, Michael Kong, based on Mr Lee’s online bank transfer records, the money was transferred to an account by the name ‘Celcom Sdn Bhd’ and that, no OTP or notification was sent to Lee

                During the debate in Parliament, Johari questioned the former administration's "poor" negotiations on Goldman Sachs' US$2.5bil (RM10.7bil) settlement over its role in the 1MDB scandal, claiming it was unfair
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We were satisfied with the US$2.5bil settlement because we achieved our political objectives." So far, the terms of the settlement agreement have been withheld due to a confidentiality provision prohibiting its publication
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim demanded that Goldman Sachs honour its agreement with the government over its role in the 1MDB scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under a settlement in October 2020, Goldman Sachs was to pay US$2.5bil while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4bil of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the globe.

                Kwong Kau, 65, former father-in-law of Choi Kwong Kau reportedly planned the grisly murder and rented the village house in February

                He is a former police sergeant who was awarded the Hong Kong Police Long Service Medal in 2001

            <p>
                He was reportedly unhappy with Choi’s handling of a luxury property and the police believe he was the mastermind behind the murder

                China claims to have used artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate an aerial battle involving a hypersonic aircraft traveling at Mach 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the computer simulation, a hypersonic aircraft came into contact with an adversary fighter jet moving at Mach 1.3, or about an F-35’s top speed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pilot of the hypersonic aircraft then received an order to shoot down the enemy aircraft, presumably the US stealth fighter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even so, aircraft traveling at Mach 5 and higher hypersonic speeds do not yet have fire-control systems for launching missiles
            </p>
            
            <p>

                China claims to have used artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate an aerial battle involving a hypersonic aircraft traveling at Mach 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the computer simulation, a hypersonic aircraft came into contact with an adversary fighter jet moving at Mach 1.3, or about an F-35’s top speed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pilot of the hypersonic aircraft then received an order to shoot down the enemy aircraft, presumably the US stealth fighter

                Even so, aircraft traveling at Mach 5 and higher hypersonic speeds do not yet have fire-control systems for launching missiles

                Maybank, which released its fourth quarter (4Q) and full financial year results for 2022 yesterday, saw net profit inch up 1.7% to RM8.23bil for the year ended Dec 31, 2022, on the back of a 10.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) rise in revenue to RM50.9bil

            <p>
                Meanwhile, chief executive and group president Datuk Khairussaleh Ramli drew attention to the group’s pre-tax profit, which rose by 21.6% y-o-y to RM2.21bil for the quarter under review, while for the full year, pre-tax profit climbed 11.6% y-o-y to RM12.2bil

                And 90min claim Sterling is on their radar with Arteta interested in a reunion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sterling and Arteta worked together for a number of years while the Spaniard was Pep Guardiola's assistant at City.  His ability to play across the front three is one of the biggest factors in any potential move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal are reportedly keeping a close eye on Chelsea winger Raheem Sterling Sterling is believed to be content at Chelsea but the blues will no doubt have to let some players go at the end of the season after their recent big sending.  The 28-year-old joined Chelsea from City in a deal worth £50m in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sterling has spoken openly of his respect for Arteta in the past and has praised his former coach for the impact he has made at Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'I knew once he went into Arsenal that it would be a great opportunity for him but also he would definitely implement what he wanted to bring in,' Sterling said in October 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'We all knew before Mikel got in how much good football they could play, how technically good they were but probably off the field they weren't as aggressive as they are with Mikel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'They run their socks off now, you can see why they benefited with some good results recently.'

                Sterling and Arteta worked together for a number of years while the Spaniard was Pep Guardiola's assistant at City.  His ability to play across the front three is one of the biggest factors in any potential move

                Arsenal are reportedly keeping a close eye on Chelsea winger Raheem Sterling Sterling is believed to be content at Chelsea but the blues will no doubt have to let some players go at the end of the season after their recent big sending.  The 28-year-old joined Chelsea from City in a deal worth £50m in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sterling has spoken openly of his respect for Arteta in the past and has praised his former coach for the impact he has made at Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'I knew once he went into Arsenal that it would be a great opportunity for him but also he would definitely implement what he wanted to bring in,' Sterling said in October 2020
            </p>

                'We all knew before Mikel got in how much good football they could play, how technically good they were but probably off the field they weren't as aggressive as they are with Mikel

                Lionel Messi was named as the FIFA Best Men’s Player of 2022 in a glitzy ceremony in Paris but his long-term rival Cristiano Ronaldo did not lodge a vote for the first time in six years  Cristiano Ronaldo did not cast a vote for the FIFA Best Men’s Player of the Year award as Lionel Messi claimed the trophy once more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is the second time in his career that he has claimed the award and stopped Polish forward Robert Lewandowski from taking the trophy home for the third year in succession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elsewhere, Ronaldo - the winner of the first two FIFA Best Men’s Player of the Year awards - was not eligible to receive any votes of his own this time around after not receiving a nomination
            </p>

                Did Lionel Messi deserve to be named the FIFA Best Men's Player of the Year? Share your thoughts in the comments below  Despite now playing in different leagues, both Messi and Ronaldo have already faced off on the pitch this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo twice managed to get on the scoresheet whilst Messi also found the net in a game that also saw Brazilian defender Marquinhos sent off

                It's been a tremendous year and it's an honour for me to be here tonight and win this award

                About Us Advertise   PARIS, Feb 28 ― Lionel Messi won the Best Fifa men's player prize for 2022 yesterday on the back of his World Cup triumph with Argentina and Spain's Alexia Putellas retained the women's award at a ceremony in Paris
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Messi beat his Paris Saint-Germain teammate, and World Cup final rival, Kylian Mbappe to the men's gong with Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema having been the other contender to claim the prize
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is the second time that Messi has won the honour inaugurated by Fifa in 2016 after football's world governing body split from Ballon d'Or organisers France Football

                This goal doubled United’s lead, and was Weghorst’s second assist since arriving at the club

                But what have other managers who won a trophy in their first seasons in charge go on to do? Sportsmail takes a look…  Erik ten Hag ended Manchester United's six-year trophy drought with debut season success Jose Mourinho - League Cup, Premier League (Chelsea), League Cup (Manchester United), Serie A (Inter Milan), UEFA Conference League (Roma)  Ten Hag follows in the footsteps of a man who knows all about winning a trophy in his first season

                She was responding to a question during an interview with Bernama that the Australian mining company’s subsidiary in Malaysia, Lynas Malaysia Sdn Bhd’s, could lose its operating license if it failed to comply with conditions prohibiting the production of radioactive waste in the country after July 1 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though the Atomic Energy Licensing Board (AELB) had approved the renewal of Lynas Malaysia Sdn Bhd’ license for a period of three years from March 3, 2023, until March 2, 2026, cracking and leaching (C&L) activities that produce radioactive waste can no longer be conducted in Gebeng, Pahang after July 1

                Malaysian Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Chang Lih Kang on February 15 said all license conditions that have been decided for the period of March 3, 2020 until March 2, 2023 must continue to be complied with by Lynas

            <p>
                Since operating in Malaysia in 2012, Lynas has produced approximately 1.08 million metric tonnes of radioactive waste (WLP residue), and this amount of waste is expected to reach 1.2 million metric tonnes by July 2023

                Arnault, 73, born in France, may be most well-known today for his founding and current leadership of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury goods company, but how he got there involved one French Franc ($0.16 USD), real estate in the French Riviera, and condominiums in Palm Beach, Florida
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Around five years into being at his father’s firm, he convinced the company and his father to liquidate the construction division and enter the real estate market — Arnault earned $15 million in the sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Named a company director in 1974, and named CEO in 1977, Arnault started building timeshares on the Mediterranean coast of southeastern France

                "Despite higher depreciation cost in the current financial year from the group’s revision in useful life for certain network and last-mile elements including fibre optic cables, the strong year-on-year (y-o-y) revenue growth resulted in a 22.9 per cent increase to the group’s operating profits before finance cost, reported at RM2.08 billion compared with RM1.7 billion in 2021,” it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the fourth quarter of FY2022, TM’s net profit increased to RM160.18 million against RM79.94 million recorded in the same quarter of FY2021, while revenue fell 5.5 per cent to RM2.98 billion from RM3.15 billion previously, on the back of the decline from other telecommunication-related services, voice and data

                In improving its competitive edge, the group has embarked on an internal reorganisation involving the transfer of its telecommunication business in Malaysia to a single operating entity, TM Technology Services Sdn Bhd, formerly known as Webe Digital Sdn Bhd, anticipated to complete by Dec 31, 2023

            <p>
                The 53-year-old bus driver was trapped in his seat and had to be extricated using hydraulic rescue equipment by the Singapore Civil Defence Force

                The 60-year-old driver of the trailer truck is assisting the police with their investigations

                The Land Transport Authority issued an alert on Twitter about the accident at about 11am, advising motorists to avoid lane 3 of the SLE

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We wish them a speedy and complete recovery, while our bus captain is still at the hospital receiving treatment,” she said, adding that SBS Transit is assisting the police with investigations.

                Recently, a US surveillance aircraft had a very close and dangerous encounter with a Chinese Shenyang J-11 fighter jet over the South China Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As per reports, the American aircraft was shadowed by the J-11 for well over an hour, and at one point, the Chinese fighter jet was barely 500 feet off the port side of the US surveillance aircraft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The incident came shortly after a US Air Force (USAF) RC-135 aircraft had a dangerously close encounter with a Chinese J-11 fighter jet in December 2022 over the South China Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Chinese fighter jet came within 10 feet (three meters) of the American surveillance aircraft, forcing the latter to perform evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It shows the Chinese fighter closely approaching the American surveillance aircraft on its left before briefly flying in front of it and drifting away

                Recently, a US surveillance aircraft had a very close and dangerous encounter with a Chinese Shenyang J-11 fighter jet over the South China Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As per reports, the American aircraft was shadowed by the J-11 for well over an hour, and at one point, the Chinese fighter jet was barely 500 feet off the port side of the US surveillance aircraft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The incident came shortly after a US Air Force (USAF) RC-135 aircraft had a dangerously close encounter with a Chinese J-11 fighter jet in December 2022 over the South China Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Chinese fighter jet came within 10 feet (three meters) of the American surveillance aircraft, forcing the latter to perform evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It shows the Chinese fighter closely approaching the American surveillance aircraft on its left before briefly flying in front of it and drifting away
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Notably, China’s J-15 carrier-capable fighter and the J-16 multirole aircraft are also said to be inspired by the J-11 design

                Deputy Agriculture and Food Security Minister Chan Foong Hin said the government also took note that the supply of several food products has been affected due to the spread of zoonotic diseases such as African Swine Fever (ASF) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in source countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the government had implemented intervention measures by increasing sources of imported food from overseas food processing plants that comply with strict conditions set before the product is imported into Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was responding to a supplementary question from Tan Kok Wai (PH-Cheras), who wanted to know whether the government will relax the conditions for food imports given that the supply of some products is affected by the spread of ASF
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Chan said PadiBeras Nasional Bhd (Bernas), as the sole approved permit holder to import rice, has succeeded in ensuring sufficient supply at all times
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chan said this in reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Mumtaz Md Nawi (PN-Tumpat) on the government's plan to reduce dependency on imported rice supply

                Deputy Agriculture and Food Security Minister Chan Foong Hin said the government also took note that the supply of several food products has been affected due to the spread of zoonotic diseases such as African Swine Fever (ASF) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in source countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the government had implemented intervention measures by increasing sources of imported food from overseas food processing plants that comply with strict conditions set before the product is imported into Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was responding to a supplementary question from Tan Kok Wai (PH-Cheras), who wanted to know whether the government will relax the conditions for food imports given that the supply of some products is affected by the spread of ASF
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Chan said PadiBeras Nasional Bhd (Bernas), as the sole approved permit holder to import rice, has succeeded in ensuring sufficient supply at all times
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chan said this in reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Mumtaz Md Nawi (PN-Tumpat) on the government's plan to reduce dependency on imported rice supply
            </p>

                Maximum prices per egg in Sarawak are higher at 47 to 50 sen (Grade A), 45 to 48 sen (Grade B), 43 to 46 sen (Grade C), as well as in Sabah at 50 sen to 51 sen (Grade A), 49 to 50 (Grade B), and 48 to 49 sen (Grade C), while in Labuan it is 51 sen (Grade A), 50 sen (Grade B) and 49 sen (Grade C)

                The domestic electricity subsidy amount for the first quarter of 2023 (1Q2023) is RM4.9 billion, above the RM2.3 billion spent in the second quarter of 2022, according to MOF data
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the RM4.9 billion, Johan said the biggest portion — 13.1% or RM1.95 billion — was used by households that consumed above 600 kWH (Domestic C)

                In the re-tabled Budget 2023, the government set aside RM6.8 billion for electricity subsidies

            <p>
                In 2022, the government spent RM50.8 billion on subsidies for petrol, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas, up from RM11.1 billion in 2021

            <p>
                For 2023, the government has allocated RM25.6 billion for these fuel subsidies

                This, he said, is because the tax reduction in the lower taxable income bands offsets the tax increase in the higher taxable income brackets

            <p>
                According to Finance Ministry data, the tax hike represents an additional tax of between 0.4% and 4.6% of taxable income for some 150,000 taxpayers in the higher income group

                The Ministry of Finance, in a statement, said the settlement was in respect of the legal proceedings in the London Court of International Arbitration and the London High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sum will be paid to the Minister of Finance Inc and 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In October 2018, the Pakatan Harapan government filed an application in the London High Court to challenge a consent award recorded by the arbitration tribunal in May 2017 — with IPIC and Aabar PJS as claimants and 1MDB and MoF Inc as respondents — under which Malaysia was to pay US$5.78 billion to IPIC and the bond trustee over five years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, Malaysia took the position that IPIC and Aabar were aware that 1MDB had been defrauded and the central role Najib had played in the scam, and that Najib was principally responsible in getting 1MDB and the MOF Inc to consent to the arbitration award
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the US$5.78 billion, US$1.46 billion had been paid by October 2018, according to Thomas, leaving a balance of US$4.32 billion, with interest payments of US$50 million each to be paid periodically and the final bullet payments — representing the principal and interest of US$1.8 billion each — to be paid in May and October 2022.  In its legal challenge, Malaysia claimed that as a result of the fraud, it should be relieved from any obligation to pay the balance US$4.32 billion to IPIC or Aabar under the consent award, and additionally had a right to recover the sum already paid

                The Ministry of Finance, in a statement, said the settlement was in respect of the legal proceedings in the London Court of International Arbitration and the London High Court

            <p>
                In October 2018, the Pakatan Harapan government filed an application in the London High Court to challenge a consent award recorded by the arbitration tribunal in May 2017 — with IPIC and Aabar PJS as claimants and 1MDB and MoF Inc as respondents — under which Malaysia was to pay US$5.78 billion to IPIC and the bond trustee over five years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, Malaysia took the position that IPIC and Aabar were aware that 1MDB had been defrauded and the central role Najib had played in the scam, and that Najib was principally responsible in getting 1MDB and the MOF Inc to consent to the arbitration award
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the US$5.78 billion, US$1.46 billion had been paid by October 2018, according to Thomas, leaving a balance of US$4.32 billion, with interest payments of US$50 million each to be paid periodically and the final bullet payments — representing the principal and interest of US$1.8 billion each — to be paid in May and October 2022.  In its legal challenge, Malaysia claimed that as a result of the fraud, it should be relieved from any obligation to pay the balance US$4.32 billion to IPIC or Aabar under the consent award, and additionally had a right to recover the sum already paid

                About Us Advertise   PUTRAJAYA, Feb 27 — Datuk Seri Najib Razak derailed the entirety of his final appeal at the Federal Court over his SRC International conviction and sentencing last year when he changed his legal counsel at the eleventh hour, prosecutors said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Telling the Federal Court during the former prime minister’s bid to have the apex court’s decision reviewed, ad hoc prosecutor Datuk V Sithambaram said Najib’s bid to change ‘horses’ so close to the scheduled hearing dates was a ‘strategy gone wrong’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sithambaram’s remark echoed his previous argument that Najib was the author of his misfortune and consequently cannot invoke the Federal Court’s inherent jurisdiction to review its own decision in his final appeal hearing last August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, ZIST opted to discharge themselves, leaving Hisyam as the remaining sole counsel in Najib’s defence whose request for dischargement was however denied by the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A five-member panel presided over today’s hearing with Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Datuk Abdul Rahman Sebli leading Federal Court judges Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, Datuk Nordin Hassan and Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abu Bakar Jais on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Nazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal judge, had sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined him RM210 million in default five years imprisonment and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on December 8, 2021.

                Liverpool would, of course, rather be in contention for everything, as they were last season

            <p>
                To many, this may bring about feelings of jealousy, but it could play to Liverpool’s advantage when both sides meet in two weeks, a game which could decide the Red’s top four chances

            <p>
                Despite United boasting a bigger squad than what Liverpool had last season with a squad of 32 compared to Liverpool’s 30, those two extra players won’t make a huge difference when it comes down to fitness levels and sharpness of the entire team

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 14-game difference may not sound like a lot on paper but in reality, the players will suffer greatly from being overused which could play a huge role when playing what will be a well-rested Liverpool side

            <p>
                Liverpool’s downfall this season could play to their advantage as United come to Anfield to meet a more energized and vivacious team could have the advantage due to their relaxed schedule.

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 27 — Barisan Nasional (BN) has demanded for public apologies and compensation from political rivals Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali over their alleged defamatory and untrue remarks relating to Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, local daily Berita Harian reported today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Berita Harian, BN had through its lawyers issued a legal letter to demand both Muhyiddin and Azmin retract their alleged defamatory remarks, to apologise and to pay compensation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing the BN Communication Division’s statement, Berita Harian reported BN as saying that Muhyiddin had accused Zahid of being the purported mastermind and planner behind the prosecution of Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan, who recently resigned as Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia information chief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BN reportedly said such accusations from Bersatu president and Perikatan Nasional chairman Muhyiddin was clearly a big and hasty slander which was allegedly deliberate in order to cover up the alleged damage within PN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Berita Harian said PN information chief Azmin had also claimed that the corruption charges against PN and Bersatu as a planned move
            </p>

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 27 — Barisan Nasional (BN) has demanded for public apologies and compensation from political rivals Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali over their alleged defamatory and untrue remarks relating to Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, local daily Berita Harian reported today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Berita Harian, BN had through its lawyers issued a legal letter to demand both Muhyiddin and Azmin retract their alleged defamatory remarks, to apologise and to pay compensation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing the BN Communication Division’s statement, Berita Harian reported BN as saying that Muhyiddin had accused Zahid of being the purported mastermind and planner behind the prosecution of Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan, who recently resigned as Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia information chief
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Berita Harian said PN information chief Azmin had also claimed that the corruption charges against PN and Bersatu as a planned move

                “Why do people say it (the allocation) is a lot? "We must get people to read the Quran and its translation so that we can understand the religion and save Islam from Islamophobia,” he said after delivering a keynote address at the International Forum on Islamophobia here on Monday (Feb 27)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the tabling of the revised Budget 2023 on Friday (Feb 24), Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said RM10mil would be allocated to translate and distribute the Quran in Swedish and other foreign languages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 27, the Prime Minister announced that the government would print one million copies of the Quran as a symbol of wisdom and maturity to respond to prejudicial and uncivilised attacks on Islam.

                Contract allied health workers, like medical lab technologists, radiographers, health inspectors, PPKs and PPPs — angry at being sidelined in a “caste” system — criticise Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa’s town hall as it was held exclusively with doctors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 27 – Contract allied health care professionals have criticised the Ministry of Health (MOH) for not addressing their working conditions and seemingly prioritising medical doctors instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Non-doctor staff from the public health service were particularly incensed with Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa’s town hall last Wednesday with government doctors that excluded other health care professionals and workers from allied health professions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Allied health care workers – such as medical laboratory technologists (JTMP), radiographers, environmental health officers (also known as health inspectors), assistant environmental health officers, health care assistants (PPK), assistant medical officers or medical assistants (PPP), and physiotherapists – told Dr Zaliha that they, like medical officers, also faced problems with understaffing, overwork, and the lack of permanent positions in the public health service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TPC all health care facilities,” he wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Warnings of an impending strike subsequently led to the health minister’s town hall with medical practitioners in the public service

                Contract allied health workers, like medical lab technologists, radiographers, health inspectors, PPKs and PPPs — angry at being sidelined in a “caste” system — criticise Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa’s town hall as it was held exclusively with doctors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 27 – Contract allied health care professionals have criticised the Ministry of Health (MOH) for not addressing their working conditions and seemingly prioritising medical doctors instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Non-doctor staff from the public health service were particularly incensed with Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa’s town hall last Wednesday with government doctors that excluded other health care professionals and workers from allied health professions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Allied health care workers – such as medical laboratory technologists (JTMP), radiographers, environmental health officers (also known as health inspectors), assistant environmental health officers, health care assistants (PPK), assistant medical officers or medical assistants (PPP), and physiotherapists – told Dr Zaliha that they, like medical officers, also faced problems with understaffing, overwork, and the lack of permanent positions in the public health service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TPC all health care facilities,” he wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Warnings of an impending strike subsequently led to the health minister’s town hall with medical practitioners in the public service

                Yesterday, Sanusi posted a lengthy statement on his Facebook page to explain the proposed Kedah Aerotropolis project and urged Anwar to support and approve the project at Kuala Muda, Kedah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Kedah Aerotropolis project will start with an integrated logistics hub which would not require an airport with passenger terminals and that such a facility will be developed if there is demand in the future, noting that the proposed Kulim international airport is just one of the project’s sub-component and will act as an enabler to the entire project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Kedah Aerotropolis project will seek to complement the Penang International Airport in terms of dealing with the projected increase in passengers especially from 2030 onwards

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sanusi said Kedah has so far spent RM28 million for the Kedah Aerotropolis project such as for consultancy fees, marketing works, and project planning, and said the state government hopes a presentation for the project can be arranged soon to enable a detailed explanation to be given to Anwar for a more in-depth understanding of the project

                Dr Yii also said Dr Halimah’s remarks on Feb 14 that Menu Rahmah may cause exposure to cancer, autoimmune disease and autism among others, was deemed to be in contempt of Parliament

                "Autism is a complex and lifelong condition, and while the exact causes are not yet fully understood, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that poor diet or bad food cause autism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Monday (Feb 20), Dr Halimah denied saying that Menu Rahmah can cause cancer, saying that the matter could be checked in the Hansard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the Hansard, Dr Halimah said in her speech on food and health that the poor should not be given low-quality food
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I have no issues with the phrase 'rahmah', but don’t give the B40 low-quality food supplies that may cause them to be exposed to cancer, autoimmune disease, autism, among others," said Dr Halimah.

                Dr Yii also said Dr Halimah’s remarks on Feb 14 that Menu Rahmah may cause exposure to cancer, autoimmune disease and autism among others, was deemed to be in contempt of Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Autism is a complex and lifelong condition, and while the exact causes are not yet fully understood, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that poor diet or bad food cause autism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Monday (Feb 20), Dr Halimah denied saying that Menu Rahmah can cause cancer, saying that the matter could be checked in the Hansard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the Hansard, Dr Halimah said in her speech on food and health that the poor should not be given low-quality food
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I have no issues with the phrase 'rahmah', but don’t give the B40 low-quality food supplies that may cause them to be exposed to cancer, autoimmune disease, autism, among others," said Dr Halimah.

                It is true that he is probably too good to be on the bench and that could msee us sell in the summer

                Please 🙏 i think he’s a good enough to be in our team its the time.

            <p>
                Tierney is a star,Smith Rowe,Nelson,Jorginho,Trossard these are very good players and its vital to keep them as they are part of what is needed,not a great team but a great squad.

                Much of the build-up was about Newcastle’s first appearance in a major final since 1999 and an uptick in their fortunes instigated by Eddie Howe since a 2021 Saudi Arabia-led takeover
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Erik ten Hag’s resurgent United side showed them how far they still need to go as they claimed the club’s first trophy since winning the Europa League under Jose Mourinho in 2017 their longest wait for silverware since 1983
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It has been an amazing period, first trophy of the season but we want more it is not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards demand more,” Bruno Fernandes, who was denied a third goal in stoppage time, said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am satisfied but I want more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead the stage was left for United whose fans were in full voice as Bruno Fernandes raised the trophy which they hope will be the first of many under Dutchman Ten Hag whose first season goes from strength to strength after some difficult early days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They had far more goal threat and Wout Weghorst fluffed a chance when he shot tamely at Karius, Newcastle’s third-choice who performed admirably in what was his first competitive match for any club since 2021

                Much of the build-up was about Newcastle’s first appearance in a major final since 1999 and an uptick in their fortunes instigated by Eddie Howe since a 2021 Saudi Arabia-led takeover
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Erik ten Hag’s resurgent United side showed them how far they still need to go as they claimed the club’s first trophy since winning the Europa League under Jose Mourinho in 2017 their longest wait for silverware since 1983
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It has been an amazing period, first trophy of the season but we want more it is not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards demand more,” Bruno Fernandes, who was denied a third goal in stoppage time, said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am satisfied but I want more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead the stage was left for United whose fans were in full voice as Bruno Fernandes raised the trophy which they hope will be the first of many under Dutchman Ten Hag whose first season goes from strength to strength after some difficult early days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They had far more goal threat and Wout Weghorst fluffed a chance when he shot tamely at Karius, Newcastle’s third-choice who performed admirably in what was his first competitive match for any club since 2021

                According to the manufacturer, the new hybrid powertrain will be specified for hybrid models by Lynk & Co as well as those from other brands under the Geely umbrella

            <p>
                The naming convention for the new, 1.5 litre BHE15 Plus hybrid powertrain appears to be a development of that of the BHE15, which was launched as part of the Leishen Hi-X modular hybrid powertrain platform in November 2021

                This is a dedicated hybrid 1.5 litre supercharged, direct-injection hybrid engine that was rolled out to replace the Geely 1.5 TD powerplant

                Dr Ahmad had asked whether or not the data under the MySejahtera app is secure, following what was said in the Auditor-General’s Report 2021 Series 2

                In earlier proceedings, Yasmin told the court that Siti Bainun ordered her to apply medicine on Bella's wound and the medicine was bought by the accused herself

                Siti Bainun, 31, said she inquired about the medicine from a pharmacist through WhatsApp and mentioned Bella's badly burned hand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Siti Bainun also disagreed with the prosecution's suggestion that she did not seriously care for Bella and gave that responsibility to Yasmin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In earlier proceedings, Yasmin told the court that Siti Bainun ordered her to apply medicine on Bella's wound and the medicine was bought by the accused herself

                Using organic methods, the former TVB actor says he and his team have managed to save hundreds of durian trees in half a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a report by a Singaporean entertainment portal, Liu and his wife were visiting his son, who is based in Malaysia, when the pandemic hit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While in Malaysia, the 64-year-old has been using his knowledge in organic farming to help durian farmers here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, Liu assisted a farmer whose orchard was suffering losses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His method must have worked as Liu said he and his team managed to save hundreds of durian trees in half a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liu's son Brandon, on the other hand, runs a successful bird's nest business in Malaysia and is known as "Bird's Nest King"

                North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visits Samjiyon City, North Korea in this undated photo released on Nov 16, 2021 by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)

                The new housing project would serve as "another proud page in the history of youth movements" and a symbol of the country's socialist revolution and "political struggle", Kim said

                Jürgen Klopp's late substitute did what none of his other midfielders were able to do against Crystal Palace and he was a rare shining light for Liverpool once again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp wanted a reaction from his Liverpool side against Crystal Palace after the demolition at Anfield by Real Madrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once again, the Liverpool midfield struggled to control the game, especially in defensive transitions, and allowed Crystal Palace to cause their defense problems time and time again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Palace youngster Michael Olise seemed to evade Liverpool's midfield time and time again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But as Olise tried to break away and produce one last counter-attack for Palace, Bajčetić was able to dispossess him off the ball once and for all in a moment that completely summarizes the state of Liverpool's midfield at the moment
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Jürgen Klopp's late substitute did what none of his other midfielders were able to do against Crystal Palace and he was a rare shining light for Liverpool once again

                But as Olise tried to break away and produce one last counter-attack for Palace, Bajčetić was able to dispossess him off the ball once and for all in a moment that completely summarizes the state of Liverpool's midfield at the moment

                Eighteen defendants were named in a class action lawsuit filed by one of FTX's customers, with Singapore's Temasek being one of them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The suit claimed that “defendant venture capital firms wielded their power, influence and deep pockets to launch FTX’s house of cards to its multibillion-dollar scale”

            <p>
                The 83-page document seen by The Straits Times alleges that the firms had been aware of fraud being committed by FTX, by virtue of having conducted due diligence checks prior to their investments

            <p>
                The US Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2022 charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding FTX investors, and on Thursday he was handed four new criminal charges in a New York federal court

            <p>
                The latest 12-count indictment accuses him of concealing from Alameda’s lenders and FTX’s equity investors the fact that Alameda had taken billions of dollars from FTX

                However, we will prioritise 400 clinics and use this allocation effectively,” she told reporters after the handing over of the Segamat Hospital new building project here today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Sekijang member of Parliament also announced an allocation of RM600,000 for the construction of 422 parking lots at Segamat Hospital, which is expected to overcome the congestion issue when the new building starts operating later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, in a separate statement, Dr Zaliha said the government had approved an allocation of RM340 million to repair 400 dilapidated clinics and hospitals nationwide, RM160 million to maintain medical equipment under the Medical Equipment Enhancement Tenure (MEET), and RM100 million to replace obsolete medical equipment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also described the overall allocation for the ministry under Budget 2023 as a very positive start towards increasing the health sector budget to five per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The allocation is equivalent to two per cent of the GDP forecast in 2023 by the Ministry of Finance and is an increase from 1.89 per cent in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When tabling the Budget 2023 yesterday, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim announced that the health sector received the second-highest allocation with RM36.3 billion compared to RM32.4 billion last year

                Singapore will have a dozen of what is considered the world’s most modern fighter jet by 2030
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen’s announcement of the acquisition during the debate on his ministry’s budget on Friday means that Singapore will have a dozen of what is considered the world’s most modern fighter jet by 2030, which will enhance not just the air force, but also the capabilities of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is a given that the air force and SAF of the future will be more networked, and we fight as one system,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The maintenance cost of the fifth-generation fighter jets has also come down, according to Mr Ang Jer Meng, director of air systems at the Defence Science and Technology Agency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Defence experts said this capability also means the RSAF will be able to keep up combat air operations even without operational, full-length runways in the event of an enemy first strike, complicating any calculations to nullify Singapore’s defences
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The F-35 is also a stealthy jet, as its radar-absorbent material means it is able to evade enemy detection and operate in contested environments

                On Friday (Feb 24), Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, when tabling Budget 2023, said beginning this year the income tax rate of resident individuals would be reduced by two percentage points for every income band from RM35,000 to RM100,000

                Here are four things to keep in mind as you plan for a $5 million retirement at age 55
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you manage your assets and plan for retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So if you make the national median income of $70,700 per year, you should plan to have around $570,000 in retirement savings before you stop working
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the other hand, it can take a lot of money to generate meaningful income. Fortunately, $5 million is indeed a lot of money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Medicare, on the other hand, can play a meaningful role in your retirement plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Consider working with a financial advisor to develop a comprehensive financial plan that addresses your income needs in retirement, estate plan and more. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard

                Dr Ng was speaking during the Committee of Supply debate on his ministry’s budget, where he also noted that defence spending in the current financial year will be a projected S$18 billion (RM59 billion), or a 5.6 per cent increase from financial year 2022

            <p>
                For instance, China is estimated to spend in excess of US$270 billion (S$364 billion) on its defence and announced a 7.1 per cent increase last year, while South Korea wants to bump up defence spending by an annual average of 6.8 per cent over the next five years

                More info Barcelona's players are adamant that they would have progressed to the Europa League round of 16 at the expense of Manchester United if three more of their stars were available to play at Old Trafford, according to reports

            <p>
                The second leg at Old Trafford was a game of fine margins, with Barcelona opening the scoring thanks to an early Robert Lewandowski spot-kick before goals from Fred and Antony sent United through to the next round after a 2-2 draw in last week's first leg at the Nou Camp

            <p>
                The occasion also saw Barcelona dumped out of the Europa League for the second season in a row but their players are said to be 'convinced' that things would have gone differently if they had three extra players available for selection.That's according to Sport, who are reporting that the general consensus in the dressing room is that Barcelona would have won if Gavi, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele had played against United on Thursday evening

                “EPF is pleased that the Budget 2023 announced earlier today takes into account the demographic changes resulting in an increasing number of an aging population as well as the significant shift in the employment landscape from formal to informal employment,” EPF chief executive officer Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan said in a statement today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amir was commenting on the proposal to contribute a one-off RM500 to EPF account holders with savings below RM10,000, extend the i-Saraan matching contribution scheme in 2023, expand the scope of tax relief for voluntary EPF contributions up to RM3,000, and the enhancement of EPF’s shariah savings accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, he said the expansion of tax relief for voluntary EPF contributions to the limit of RM3,000 will encourage more Malaysians to increase their retirement funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The wellbeing of Malaysians during their golden years remains a key priority and EPF will support the implementation of these initiatives to catalyse the accumulation of retirement savings for EPF members, with a view to helping them achieve a dignified retirement,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between 2020 and 2022, EPF members were allowed four early withdrawals of not more than RM10,000 each time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since then, Perikatan Nasional MPs have continued to call for targeted EPF withdrawals to help Malaysians cope with the cost-of-living crisis, but the current unity government has declined to allow it.

                The Health Minister said the pilot project was one of the measures taken by the government to reduce congestion and patient waiting time at hospitals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said the ministry also welcomed the government’s move to impose excise duty on liquid or gel products containing nicotine used in electronic cigarettes or vape of which half of the excise duty will be reallocated to the Health Ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government's commitment to table the Control of Tobacco Products and Smoking Bill together with the Generational Endgame (GEG) can protect the younger generation from the smoking habit and reduce deaths due to diseases related to smoking and vaping, she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Health Ministry received the second-highest allocation of RM36.3bil compared with RM32.4bil in 2022, an increase of 12%

                The Health Minister said the pilot project was one of the measures taken by the government to reduce congestion and patient waiting time at hospitals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said the ministry also welcomed the government’s move to impose excise duty on liquid or gel products containing nicotine used in electronic cigarettes or vape of which half of the excise duty will be reallocated to the Health Ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government's commitment to table the Control of Tobacco Products and Smoking Bill together with the Generational Endgame (GEG) can protect the younger generation from the smoking habit and reduce deaths due to diseases related to smoking and vaping, she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Health Ministry received the second-highest allocation of RM36.3bil compared with RM32.4bil in 2022, an increase of 12%
