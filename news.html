                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — Former Klang MP Charles Santiago today questioned how chicken and eggs can remain affordable for the B60 or those in the bottom 60 per cent income tier in Malaysia if the government removes the maximum selling price after June, given that just a few companies dominate production of these food items
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He called for transparency in the government’s removal of price controls or plan to float the prices of chicken and eggs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Given that eight firms control 65 per cent of production, how will the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS) ensure chicken and egg prices remain affordable to the B60 while also meeting self-sufficiency needs? “As this dominance is alarming, the Malaysia Competition Commission should release its findings on cartel activities in the industry before the float is introduced, especially since the findings have been pending for too long now,” he said in a statement, without naming those eight companies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As such, transparency is key, and the responsibility is on the government to make all information public,” he concluded

            <p>
                Currently, the government has imposed price controls to only allow the maximum retail selling price in peninsular Malaysia for chicken to be at RM9.40 per kg, and the highest allowed selling price for eggs to be at 45 sen (Grade A), 43 sen (Grade B) and 41 sen (Grade C)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The maximum selling price in Langkawi, Labuan, Sabah and Sarawak depends on the different zones and districts there.

                A seismic shake-up of the governance of English football, including the creation on an independent regulator for the elite game, will move closer with the publication of a wide-ranging government white paper on Thursday

                It would also have the power to prevent English clubs from joining breakaway competitions such as the European Super League, which six Premier League clubs signalled their intent to join in 2021 before abandoning plans after a fans' backlash

            <p>
                "These bold new plans will put fans back at the heart of football and protect the rich heritage and traditions of our much-loved clubs." The Premier League, which has argued against the need for an independent regulator, said the white paper was a "significant moment" for English football, while the Football Association welcomed the commitment to improve the "financial sustainability and governance of professional clubs." Among the powers of the independent regulator would be to implement a licensing system from the Premier League down to the National League (fifth tier) and requiring clubs to demonstrate sound financial business models before being allowed to compete

            <p>
                The Premier League said it recognised the case for change in football governance and would carefully consider the government's plan for England to become the "first major nation to make football a government-regulated industry." It insists it has taken action to address issues raised in the Fan-Led Review and that £1.6bn is being reinvested down the pyramid over the next three seasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We will now work constructively with stakeholders to ensure that the proposed government regulator does not lead to any unintended consequences that could affect the Premier League's position as the most-watched football league in the world, reduce its competitiveness or put the unrivalled levels of funding we provide at risk," the Premier League said

                As your monthly car costs increase, you can dodge a debt default by avoiding two common auto loan mistakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the fact that car prices started to cool off by the end of 2022, a concerning trend of auto loan defaults and car repossessions has started to surface
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are ways to save money as the cost of car ownership grows more cumbersome
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if you have $15,000 left to pay on your auto loan and your car is now worth $10,000, that means you have negative equity of $5,000 that you still have to pay
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you can’t pay off your old auto loan out of pocket, you’ll have to roll the negative equity over to your new loan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The older your car, the more likely you’ll have to spend money on repairs and maintenance in addition to your monthly loan payments
            </p>

                As your monthly car costs increase, you can dodge a debt default by avoiding two common auto loan mistakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the fact that car prices started to cool off by the end of 2022, a concerning trend of auto loan defaults and car repossessions has started to surface

            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if you have $15,000 left to pay on your auto loan and your car is now worth $10,000, that means you have negative equity of $5,000 that you still have to pay
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you can’t pay off your old auto loan out of pocket, you’ll have to roll the negative equity over to your new loan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The older your car, the more likely you’ll have to spend money on repairs and maintenance in addition to your monthly loan payments

                United were happy to concede 57 per cent of the ball to Barcelona while looking dangerous in transition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When defending as a unit last Thursday, United didn’t defend deeper down the pitch, instead preferring to sit in a 4-2-3-1 block in the Barca half, going man-for-man in midfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether Manchester United progress to the next phase could all depend on how Barcelona deal with the threat of the in-form attacker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford’s pace behind the Catalan defence was a weapon that Barcelona simply could not defuse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So how can Xavi set up his side to deal with the Man United man’s prowess? The answer is easier said than done of course, but there are two ways Barcelona can maintain Rashford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second method is more logical for Barcelona
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will allow Barcelona to keep their higher defensive stance while still having enough pace to keep up with Manchester United’s danger man when bearing down on goal
            </p>

                Barcelona were struggling to play out from the back

                Rashford’s pace behind the Catalan defence was a weapon that Barcelona simply could not defuse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So how can Xavi set up his side to deal with the Man United man’s prowess? The answer is easier said than done of course, but there are two ways Barcelona can maintain Rashford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second method is more logical for Barcelona
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will allow Barcelona to keep their higher defensive stance while still having enough pace to keep up with Manchester United’s danger man when bearing down on goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcelona were struggling to play out from the back

                The new price has since been reflected on Netflix’s signup page as well as its Help Centre for Malaysia

                “As littoral states in the South China Sea, Indonesia and China will work with other ASEAN member states to implement the declaration of conduct on the South China Sea and accelerate the negotiations for a code of conduct.” The ministers did not mention when the negotiations would take place but earlier this month, Mdm Marsudi had said that they would take place in March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The South China Sea is one of the most contested waters in the world.  China claims much of the South China Sea based on a nine-dash line map it uses to claim the waters which Indonesia considers as lacking international legal basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ASEAN countries have been trying to negotiate a code of conduct with China since the 1990s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides the South China Sea, the foreign ministers also talked about the Myanmar crisis.  Mdm Marsudi expressed her appreciation for China supporting the Five-Point of Consensus to end the violence in Myanmar following the February 2021 coup.  “The Five-Point of Consensus is the main reference for ASEAN to help Myanmar out of its political crisis,” she said referring to the consensus adopted by ASEAN leaders in Jakarta in April 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During a meeting in April 2021, all ASEAN leaders reached a consensus about the situation in Myanmar

                “As littoral states in the South China Sea, Indonesia and China will work with other ASEAN member states to implement the declaration of conduct on the South China Sea and accelerate the negotiations for a code of conduct.” The ministers did not mention when the negotiations would take place but earlier this month, Mdm Marsudi had said that they would take place in March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The South China Sea is one of the most contested waters in the world.  China claims much of the South China Sea based on a nine-dash line map it uses to claim the waters which Indonesia considers as lacking international legal basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ASEAN countries have been trying to negotiate a code of conduct with China since the 1990s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides the South China Sea, the foreign ministers also talked about the Myanmar crisis.  Mdm Marsudi expressed her appreciation for China supporting the Five-Point of Consensus to end the violence in Myanmar following the February 2021 coup.  “The Five-Point of Consensus is the main reference for ASEAN to help Myanmar out of its political crisis,” she said referring to the consensus adopted by ASEAN leaders in Jakarta in April 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During a meeting in April 2021, all ASEAN leaders reached a consensus about the situation in Myanmar

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin has today confirmed the resignation Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan as Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) information chief from today, The Bersatu president however said this decision is not an acknowledgement that Wan Saiful is guilty

                Earlier this morning, Wan Saiful had offered to relinquish his information chief post in the party due to his ongoing court case

            <p>
                He added that his position as the information chief is an executive position, it was rightful that he relinquished it until he is able to prove his innocence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Wan Saiful claimed trial for two bribery charges at the Sessions Court here, in connection with the government’s Jana Wibawa scheme back in 2022

            <p>
                In the second charge, Wan Saiful was accused of receiving RM6,962,694.54 from Nepturis in relation to the same government road project

            </p>

                The Home Ministry said it has plans to purchase 7,648 units of Body Worn Camera (BWC) with an estimation of RM2,000 to RM2,500 per unit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to that, in 2021, the previous government had approved an allocation of RM30 million under the 12th Malaysia Plan to purchase body cameras for the police
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — The Independent Police Conduct Commission (IPCC) will be in force starting July 1, 2023, the Home Ministry said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was in response to DAP Kepong MP Lim Lip Eng’s question on the status of the establishment of the Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission (IPCMC)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bill was later replaced when Perikatan Nasional (PN) took the government, with the Independent Police Conduct Commission Bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Home Ministry said it has plans to purchase 7,648 units of Body Worn Camera (BWC) with an estimation of RM2,000 to RM2,500 per unit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to that, in 2021, the previous government had approved an allocation of RM30 million under the 12th Malaysia Plan to purchase body cameras for the police
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, three were detained for filming the police raid

                Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously announced in October 2022 that the EV maker is working on a next-generation platform that would be half the price of the Model 3 and Model Y, and a model that is set to be priced in the region of US$25,000 (RM111,025) is expected to make its debut in 2023, this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The idea of a more affordable Tesla model was put forth by Musk as early as 2018, at which time the CEO said the company could produce in three years from that time, or 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When June 2021 rolled around, Musk said that the new model, which will be a hatchback, is planned for a 2023 debut
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One way that Tesla could manage costs with the new model is with its tabless 4680 battery cell design, which the company revealed at its Battery Day event in September 2020

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan said today he has offered to relinquish his information chief position in the party due to his ongoing court case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But let this decision be made by the top leadership,” Wan Saiful told a press conference here at the Parliament building here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that his position as the information chief is an executive position, it was rightful that he relinquished it until he is able to prove his innocence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Wan Saiful claimed trial for two bribery charges at the Sessions Court here, in connection with the government’s Jana Wibawa scheme back in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second charge, Wan Saiful was accused of receiving RM6,962,694.54 from Nepturis in relation to the same government road project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sessions Court judge Azura Alwi set bail at RM400,000 and told Wan Saiful that he has to surrender his passport to the court before March 22.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan said today he has offered to relinquish his information chief position in the party due to his ongoing court case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But let this decision be made by the top leadership,” Wan Saiful told a press conference here at the Parliament building here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that his position as the information chief is an executive position, it was rightful that he relinquished it until he is able to prove his innocence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Wan Saiful claimed trial for two bribery charges at the Sessions Court here, in connection with the government’s Jana Wibawa scheme back in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second charge, Wan Saiful was accused of receiving RM6,962,694.54 from Nepturis in relation to the same government road project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sessions Court judge Azura Alwi set bail at RM400,000 and told Wan Saiful that he has to surrender his passport to the court before March 22.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — The suspension of rail services since January was due to structural damage of the viaduct and cracked pier near the Bandaraya LRT station, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As stated by the Land Public Transport Agency on January 27, the construction works started without any consultation with APAD under the Railway Regulations (Railway Protection Zone) 1998

                One patent was revoked by the High Court in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Friday, in a landmark decision which addressed novel points of patent law, the Court of Appeal ordered the second patent to be revoked as it was not sufficiently clear and complete
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One patent, identified as SG 508, relates to a method of changing the colour of a lab-grown diamond by heat treatment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the Patents Act, a patent is valid only if it discloses the invention “in a manner which is clear and complete”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court found that the patent was not sufficiently clear, as it did not set out the method to allow a skilled person reading the patent to grow the lab-grown diamond
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court found that the patent was also insufficient because it was “uncertain” – even if a skilled person grew a diamond, he would not know whether that diamond infringed Element Six’s patent.

                Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, RM30mil was allocated for the acquisition of Body Worn Camera (BWC) which will be fitted on officers across 157 district police headquarters nationwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The BWC will be used by police officers stationed in the field, particularly the police patrol car units and the police motorcycle patrol units, as well as road patrols by the police in 157 district police headquarters nationwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin also said the Independent Police Conduct Commission (IPCC) Act will be enforced beginning July 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The IPCC Act was passed in the Dewan Rakyat in July of last year and it will see the setting-up of an independent commission to monitor the integrity of the police force and probe complaints of misconduct involving police personnel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin was responding to Lim Lip Eng (PH-Kepong) who asked about the setting up of the IPCC and the breakdown of body cams that will be fitted on police officers

                Salah showed against Real Madrid in brief fleeting moments that this team is capable of a lot more, and it's time for Liverpool to once again give him the power to wield all his quality once more

                Ten Hag has United in the title race, the fifth round of the FA Cup, and they take on Newcastle in the final of the Carabao Cup on Sunday in search of their first trophy since 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ferguson of course claimed Manchester United’s last win over Barcelona by 1-0 in the Champions League semi-final second-leg in 2008 having fought out a goalless draw in the Nou Camp

                The Dutchman has got Man United back to their best since taking over last summer and his side are the only club in Europe still competing in four competitions

            <p>
                I can sense with the staff that they're more upbeat, happy to be at work every day, and that's all been generated and created by Erik ten Hag and his team - and some people behind the scenes

            <p>
                'It's not one person that is able to change a whole culture of a football club, it's a group, it's a collective approach.  'They are on the right path right now and given they're in the running for four trophies still - not that I think they'll win four - they've been fantastic of late
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's nice to go to Carrington and Old Trafford and feel more optimistic than negative.' In the years since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, United have often lacked leaders, but Ferdinand believes the dressing room is filling back up with the right characters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'At United, what we've been crying out for over the years is character, leaders,' Ferdinand added.  Ferdinand named recent additions Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane among the leaders in the dressing room The former United defender also praised Luke Shaw and David de Gea for their role in the dressing room 'Not a leader or a character, you want characters

                KIERAN TIERNEY is considering his future at Arsenal after becoming increasingly frustrated by his lack of action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tierney, 25, has managed just four Premier League starts all season following the signing of Oleksandr Zinchenko last summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manager Mikel Arteta is sympathetic to his situation and hopes that Arsenal’s impending return to Europa League duty will give Tierney more opportunities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the way the team is playing this season, with Zinchenko stepping into midfield for much of the match, does not suit Tierney’s style
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And even when Zinchenko was sidelined by injury throughout the whole of October, Arteta preferred to play Takehiro Tomiyasu at left-back ahead of Tierney
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arteta, though, is unlikely to stand in the way of his departure as he has both Tomiyasu and recent signing Jakub Kiwior who can act as back-up to Zinchenko

                Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said the boy, who had sailed from Chittagong in Bangladesh to Port Klang, was found in a weak condition on Jan 17 when the ship docked at port
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "During that period, the Home Ministry contacted the Bangladesh High Commission to help prepare his (travel) papers," he said, adding that the boy did not have any travel documents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin said during his recent visit to Bangladesh in relation to the foreign worker issue, he had informed the Bangladeshi Home Minister that he would facilitate the repatriation process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The South Klang police confirmed on Jan 20, that the boy was found in a container
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the foreign boy was not a stowaway attempting to sneak into the country but was instead unintentionally locked up in the container after playing in it with some friends in Chittagong, Bangladesh

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 — The prices of chicken and eggs are expected to be floated after June as part of the government’s efforts to overcome food shortage, says Agriculture and Food Security Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January, Mohamad reportedly said that MAFS was studying the need to float the price of eggs in the market and provide targeted subsidies to the B40 group, and that discussions were being held with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy and KPDN over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current retail ceiling price in Peninsular Malaysia for standard chicken is RM9.40 per kg and for eggs, it is 45 sen for Grade A, Grade B (43 sen) and Grade C (41 sen) respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, commenting on grain corn, which is almost 100 per cent imported from Argentina and Brazil — affecting the price of chicken and eggs — Mohamad said the government was encouraging its cultivation in Malaysia this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Budget 2023 which will be tabled this Friday, Mohamad said he hoped there would be no reduction in the amount allocated to his ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to the 15th General Election at the end of last year, the government led by Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob had announced Budget 2023 with a total allocation of RM372.3 billion, and of the amount, RM5.32 billion was allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries

                "We are confident that the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security will satisfy demand for chicken and eggs (through price floating), and even [though] now it is sufficient, but in five or six months' time, it will be more sufficient if no new undesirable matters (such as disasters) arise,” he said when interviewed at his office here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January, Mohamad reportedly said that his ministry was studying the need to float the price of eggs in the market and provide targeted subsidies to the bottom 40% household income group, and that discussions were being held with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living over the matter

            <p>
                The current retail ceiling price in Peninsular Malaysia for standard chicken is RM9.40 per kg, and for eggs, it is 45 sen for Grade A, followed by 43 sen for Grade B, and 41 sen for Grade C
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, commenting on grain corn, which is almost 100% imported from Argentina and Brazil — affecting the prices of chicken and eggs — Mohamad said the government is encouraging cultivation of the crop in Malaysia this year
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Prior to the 15th general election at the end of last year, the government led by Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob had announced Budget 2023 with a total allocation of RM372.3 billion, and of the amount, RM5.32 billion was allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries

                "We are confident that the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security will satisfy demand for chicken and eggs (through price floating), and even [though] now it is sufficient, but in five or six months' time, it will be more sufficient if no new undesirable matters (such as disasters) arise,” he said when interviewed at his office here

            <p>
                In January, Mohamad reportedly said that his ministry was studying the need to float the price of eggs in the market and provide targeted subsidies to the bottom 40% household income group, and that discussions were being held with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living over the matter

                The current retail ceiling price in Peninsular Malaysia for standard chicken is RM9.40 per kg, and for eggs, it is 45 sen for Grade A, followed by 43 sen for Grade B, and 41 sen for Grade C
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, commenting on grain corn, which is almost 100% imported from Argentina and Brazil — affecting the prices of chicken and eggs — Mohamad said the government is encouraging cultivation of the crop in Malaysia this year

            <p>
                TasteAtlas, which focuses on food and features reviews as well as recommendations from culinary professionals and critics around the world, tweeted on Saturday (Feb 18) a ranking of the top 50 street foods in the world.  Guotie, which took the top place, is a pan-fried dumpling originating from Northern China that is commonly filled with minced pork, Chinese cabbage, scallions, ginger, rice wine, and sesame seed oil, according to TasteAtlas.  Coming in second is Malaysia’s savoury roti canai which is a flatbread with a soft interior that is pan-fried, commonly with ghee, to produce a crispy outer layer.  The dough, which is made with flour, water, eggs and fat, is repeatedly folded to give the flatbread a layered texture.  Also in the top 10 are Japan’s karaage which took the sixth spot, and Vietnam’s bánh mì which was in the seventh position.  Kaarage, or Japanese fried chicken, is pre-marinated chicken that is lightly coated in arrowroot starch before being deep-fried, creating a meat that is succulent on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The karaage dishes are usually seasoned with garlic and ginger and served with soy sauce on the side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other favourites that joined the top 50 list include China’s Shengjian mantou (pan-fried buns) (12th), Indonesia’s bubur ayam (chicken porridge) (13th), and South Korea’s hotteok (sweet pancake) (38th).

                Man Utd host FC Barcelona in the second leg of their Europa League play-off tie and the midfield battle will be crucial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It will be far from easy for United, though the very early team news certainly gives them confidence, with Barcelona's midfield options limited while their own have been boosted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In contrast, United have received a midfield boost ahead of the game, with Marcel Sabitzer returning from suspension for the second leg, while Lisandro Martinez is also available again and should help his side's defensive stability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He might not be the most technically gifted player, but few would begrudge Fred a start on Thursday night, given that he would bring energy and enthusiasm into the United midfield on a night when they will look to feed off the Old Trafford crowd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That approach has already worked by making United a difficult team to prepare for this week, given that Barcelona can't be certain which side they will be up against
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the first time in a while, it feels like United head into a match with a number of different midfield set-ups to choose from

                Man Utd host FC Barcelona in the second leg of their Europa League play-off tie and the midfield battle will be crucial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It will be far from easy for United, though the very early team news certainly gives them confidence, with Barcelona's midfield options limited while their own have been boosted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In contrast, United have received a midfield boost ahead of the game, with Marcel Sabitzer returning from suspension for the second leg, while Lisandro Martinez is also available again and should help his side's defensive stability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He might not be the most technically gifted player, but few would begrudge Fred a start on Thursday night, given that he would bring energy and enthusiasm into the United midfield on a night when they will look to feed off the Old Trafford crowd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That approach has already worked by making United a difficult team to prepare for this week, given that Barcelona can't be certain which side they will be up against
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the first time in a while, it feels like United head into a match with a number of different midfield set-ups to choose from

                The judge had earlier asked the lawyer’s assistant, Siti Zulaikha Zulkifli, who was in the courtroom on the whereabouts of lawyer Mohammad Farhan Maaruf

                According to Siti Zulaikha, Siti Bainun had arrived at the court, but she might have gone to the toilet and at this juncture, Siti Bainun was seen entering the public gallery and the judge subsequently told her to enter the dock

                The judge had earlier asked the lawyer’s assistant, Siti Zulaikha Zulkifli, who was in the courtroom on the whereabouts of lawyer Mohammad Farhan Maaruf
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Siti Zulaikha, Siti Bainun had arrived at the court, but she might have gone to the toilet and at this juncture, Siti Bainun was seen entering the public gallery and the judge subsequently told her to enter the dock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why did you go out? You should be in court

            <p>
                Yesterday, Siti Bainun informed the court that she had re-appointed Mohammad Farhan, who was one of the five lawyers who withdrew from representing her, to handle her defence proceedings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before proceeding with today’s hearing, Izralizam said that although Siti Bainun, 31, has the right to appoint, choose and change lawyers, changing lawyers at the last minute had affected the course of the case in court

                Despite the defence’s insistence in August back then, the Federal Court’s five-judge panel led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat unanimously dismissed the defence’s bid for a postponement to be granted

            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee also touched on the necessity for a review of Tengku Maimun’s decision over the defence’s recusal application filed against her pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of the Federal Court 1995

                Following his incarceration, Najib had since sought to challenge the Federal Court’s five-member bench’s August 2022 unanimous decision in affirming his conviction, sentence and fine meted out by the High Court for the misappropriation of RM42 million of SRC International Sdn Bhd fund

                The type of jellyfish spotted along the beaches have yet to be identified by the authorities but some jellyfish are highly venomous

            <p>
                The Box jellyfish were among the more venomous species of jellyfish that had been spotted in Sabah's waters and have been blamed for a few fatal cases
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A jellyfish bloom is when a substantial increase in the population of jellyfish in one area occurs

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 — Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH) should come up with a few travel options for Malaysian Muslim pilgrims based on how long they plan to stay in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Bera MP Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing data from the Muslim pilgrim’s fund, Ismail Sabri said the cost of the Haj has increased from RM25,540 last year to RM31,870 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the more the costs increase, the bigger the financial burden on LTH in subsidising the travel expenses for Muslim pilgrims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the four-day package will cover the necessary Haj obligations for Muslim pilgrims while those who opt for the longer packages would be able to visit Medina, another city in Saudi Arabia holy to Muslims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri also proposed a review of the Tabung Haji Act 1995, saying many provisions are now outdated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LTH executive director Datuk Seri Syed Saleh Syed Abdul Rahman said last month that the cost of completing a Haj pilgrimage has gone up to about RM31,000 this year, increasing by about RM2,368 from last season.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 — Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan today claimed trial to two bribery charges at the Sessions Court here, in connection with the government’s Jana Wibawa scheme back in 2022

                Smoke billows from the cooling towers of a coal-fired power plant in Ahmedabad, India, on Oct 13, 2021

                Many of India's power plants that use imported coal, including those owned by Adani Power and Tata Power in the western state of Gujarat, have not operated at full capacity recently because they have found it difficult to compete with power generated from cheap domestic coal

                India expects its power plants to burn about 8 per cent more coal in the financial year ending March 2024, with increased economic activity and erratic weather to continue to boost growth in demand for power

                Malaysia should also adopt neutrality in trade policies to attract investment for long-term economic stability, said Dr Jomo Kwame Sundram
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a recent interview with The Edge, Jomo said wasteful and unnecessary spending needs to be cut in line with the steady slowdown in direct tax collection over the decades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The subject of targeted subsidy has been in the spotlight, particularly targeted petrol subsidy, as the current blanket subsidy mechanism caused total subsidy bills to jump to RM80 billion last year amid elevated oil prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This put a strain on the government’s coffers, which has seen a gradual increase in big-ticket operating expenditures, such as subsidies, debt service charges and emoluments as a percentage of federal government revenue year after year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jomo expects more responsible budgets and major reforms by the government over the medium term rather than sooner — perhaps in Budget 2024 to be tabled in October this year, once the regime is further consolidated following imminent state elections in mid-2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new government is also looking to restore economic confidence with a five-member advisory committee chaired by Tan Sri Mohd Hassan Marican to look at ways to reduce federal operating expenditure and increase the nation’s revenue base, among others

                Premier League • England The agent of Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic reportedly blocked a big-money January switch to Manchester United, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Along with United, Chelsea have also registered an interest in signing Vlahovic, but it seems the Red Devils came very close to sealing a stunning winter switch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Spanish outlet AS, Juventus accepted an offer between €100m (£88.8m) and €120m (£106.5m) for Vlahovic from an unnamed Premier League club, believed to be Man Utd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, United are thought to be keen to bring in another quality striker for next season – someone who could link up effectively with Marcus Rashford, who is in the form of his career at the moment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But, it seems United we’re instead looking to bring in Vlahovic in January, who would have been a fantastic addition, and could’ve given them the firepower necessary to push for the Premier League title
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his agent rejecting a winter switch, United continue to be linked with Vlahovic, so there is a good chance that they will go back in for him this summer Recent reports suggest that Real Madrid are also interested in signing the Serbian, so United may have to battle them, and Chelsea, for his signature

                The Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corp (MGTC) has honoured Penang for its design as part of its drive to promote Low Carbon Cities (LCCs) in Malaysia, with the state given the “Diamond” award for PSI’s design at the Low Carbon City 2022 event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                MGTC, an agency under the Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change Ministry, said the Low Carbon City 2022 award was part of its flagship programme called the Low Carbon Cities 2030 Challenge (LCC2030C), an initiative to help shift Malaysian cities and conversations towards a low carbon future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The push for low carbon cities began in 2011, when the Low Carbon Cities Framework and Assessment System (LCCF) was set up by the government (under the then Energy, Green Technology and Water Ministry) to guide local authorities and statutory organisations to transform their towns and territories into low carbon urban centres
            </p>
            
            <p>

                The Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corp (MGTC) has honoured Penang for its design as part of its drive to promote Low Carbon Cities (LCCs) in Malaysia, with the state given the “Diamond” award for PSI’s design at the Low Carbon City 2022 event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                MGTC, an agency under the Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change Ministry, said the Low Carbon City 2022 award was part of its flagship programme called the Low Carbon Cities 2030 Challenge (LCC2030C), an initiative to help shift Malaysian cities and conversations towards a low carbon future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The push for low carbon cities began in 2011, when the Low Carbon Cities Framework and Assessment System (LCCF) was set up by the government (under the then Energy, Green Technology and Water Ministry) to guide local authorities and statutory organisations to transform their towns and territories into low carbon urban centres

            <p>
                Less than 24 hours later, it was now Man City not Arsenal, who were nervously looking over their shoulders as their lead over Manchester United, which had been six points in Matchweek 16, was reduced to three

            <p>
                Arsenal can restore the gap to five points  if they beat Leicester on Saturday and Man City lose at AFC Bournemouth

                What happened last May doesn’t matter on Tuesday night.  Liverpool and Real Madrid are now new teams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real will try to play to Vinicius as much as they can in the gap that Alexander-Arnold will leave when he goes forward.  How can you stop Real doing that? It will be a big challenge for Jurgen Klopp because Alexander-Arnold offers so much when he pushes high, but Vinicius is the one player who can make a difference and hurt Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will offer balance to the midfield and that will be difficult for Liverpool to deal with
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We were so good and went on to win 4-0.  I watched Liverpool against Everton last week and the intensity of the team and the fans made the difference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real’s advantage in the past was having more experience in important European games but Liverpool have a lot of players like that now.  If they play with the same intensity as they did in their last home game, Liverpool will have chances

            <p>
                Marcus Rashford has been in the best form of his career at Manchester United this season Rashford's new heights have come with help from former Blackburn star Benni McCarthy One-on-one sessions with McCarthy have helped turn Rashford into a more confident, direct striker and also improved his heading, which resulted in emphatic finishes against Leeds and West Ham
            </p>
            
            <p>
                McCarthy was asked to take a few sessions with United's Under 23s at Carrington, which were observed by Ten Hag and his coaches, before he was offered a full-time position while the club were on tour last summer

                In a widely circulated article, a Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) academician and chip researcher say China’s chip sector has entered a “dark forest” without access to advanced US chip-making software and coming restrictions on deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography tools made by Japan and the Netherlands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As Chinese chip makers could buy and use the PDK in the past, our decision-makers, government officials and industry players tended to think that China could develop its chip sector without fundamental research.” “But since the US turned off the ‘lighthouse,’ we have now entered a dark forest,” they wrote, referring to US blocks on selling advanced chip-making equipment to China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The writers say China’s research and development investments in the sector represent less than 5% of US investments while China still lacks a proper institution to organize the industry’s developments

                Some Chinese IT writers and observers said they were surprised to read the CAS article’s dismal portrayal of China’s chip sector, which many said they didn’t think was so laggard

                As you may be able to recall, the telco has recently revamped its postpaid offering with the brand-new UNI5G Postpaid Plans

            <p>
                The FAQ document for these plans [pdf] noted that with the launch of these new postpaid options, TM has decided to discontinue the existing 4G-only Unifi Postpaid plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At that time, we thought that only applies to the four postpaid plans which were known as the Value Plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because the current unlimited 5G pass for the Ultimate plan is only valid until the end of February 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For those who want to obtain the same service level as per Ultimate plan which has unlimited data and calls as well as 10GB of hotspot data, they have to sign up for the UNI5G 89 plan

            <p>
                As you may be able to recall, the telco has recently revamped its postpaid offering with the brand-new UNI5G Postpaid Plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The FAQ document for these plans [pdf] noted that with the launch of these new postpaid options, TM has decided to discontinue the existing 4G-only Unifi Postpaid plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At that time, we thought that only applies to the four postpaid plans which were known as the Value Plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because the current unlimited 5G pass for the Ultimate plan is only valid until the end of February 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For those who want to obtain the same service level as per Ultimate plan which has unlimited data and calls as well as 10GB of hotspot data, they have to sign up for the UNI5G 89 plan
            </p>

                "Taiwan and the United States continue to bolster military exchanges, and going forward Taiwan will cooperate even more actively with the United States and other democratic partners to confront such global challenges as authoritarian expansionism and climate change," Tsai told the lawmakers at her office in Taipei

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb 21 — A 15-year-old self-radicalised student who has been detained by law last December was assessed by the Internal Security Department (ISD) to be posing an imminent security threat that warranted preventive detention

                Another teenager, a self-radicalised 16-year-old who was caught in January, did not have intentions to conduct armed violence in Singapore or overseas and was therefore placed under a Restriction Order and not detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA)

            <p>

                Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday delivered a nuclear warning to the West over Ukraine, suspending a landmark nuclear arms control treaty, announcing new strategic systems had been put on combat duty, and warning that Moscow could resume nuclear tests

                Erik ten Hag has continued to put his faith in Wout Weghorst despite a slow scoring start to life at Man Utd

            <p>
                Weghorst has arrived at United at a difficult time given he will naturally draw comparisons with Anthony Martial and Cristiano Ronaldo, and while he has not matched the duo for goals this season, he has at least given Ten Hag the reliable work rate he demands up front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think he is doing a very good job in this moment in several aspects of the football." This was the case again against Leicester at the weekend, with Weghorst playing a key role in United's approach, even though he didn't enjoy the best day in front of goal himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is also important to note that it is not Weghorst's fault that he has been exposed by the lack of options in the United squad

                About Us Advertise KYIV, Feb 20 — US President Joe Biden announced new military aid for Ukraine during an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital today, showing solidarity with Kyiv days before the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine

            <p>
                A case management for the appeal was conducted on Monday before Court of Appeal deputy registrar Norshakinah Ahmad Kamarudin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Oct 27, last year, the High Court in Kuala Lumpur dismissed the former prime minister's application to obtain leave to commence a judicial review to challenge the Prisons Department's refusal to allow his request to attend Parliament sittings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Datuk Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid held that Najib's application was academic as he ceased to be a MP following the dissolution of Parliament on Oct 10 last year, which had paved the way for the 15th General Election which was subsequently held on Nov 19 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib had named the Malaysian Government, the Minister of Home Affairs and the Commissioner-General of Prisons in his application seeking leave to initiate a judicial review which he filed on Oct 5, last year
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                A case management for the appeal was conducted on Monday before Court of Appeal deputy registrar Norshakinah Ahmad Kamarudin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Oct 27, last year, the High Court in Kuala Lumpur dismissed the former prime minister's application to obtain leave to commence a judicial review to challenge the Prisons Department's refusal to allow his request to attend Parliament sittings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Datuk Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid held that Najib's application was academic as he ceased to be a MP following the dissolution of Parliament on Oct 10 last year, which had paved the way for the 15th General Election which was subsequently held on Nov 19 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib had named the Malaysian Government, the Minister of Home Affairs and the Commissioner-General of Prisons in his application seeking leave to initiate a judicial review which he filed on Oct 5, last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hearing of his application to review the Federal Court's decision is currently ongoing

                Welcome to the ESPN Singapore Edition Janusz Michallik praises Man United's Alejandro Garnacho, but urges caution about hyping him up too much too early
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Garnacho, 18, is out of contract in 2024 but the source said there is a financial consensus for him to extend his stay at Old Trafford until 2028
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new deal will see his salary adjusted according to his new status in Erik ten Hag's squad due to the progress he has made since making his first team debut last April
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Negotiations over new terms started a few months ago and a source close to the talks confirmed to ESPN the club and the player have now reached an agreement over the financial elements of the deal and the length of the contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Garnacho, who joined United from Atletico Madrid in 2020, has a Spanish father and an Argentine mother and is eligible to play for both countries

                Prime Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed that 11 people had so far died in the wake of the devastating flash flooding and high winds which lashed the North Island last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hipkins has warned that the final death toll could rise, but the number of people who police were still looking to contact had fallen to about 2,300

            <p>
                Finance Minister Grant Robertson on Monday pledged NZ$300 million (US$187 million) of relief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We have a long job ahead of us to rebuild after this disaster," warned Robertson, who Hipkins has also made cyclone recovery minister

            <p>
                After spending the weekend visiting hard-hit communities, Hipkins said that the national state of emergency declared last week has been extended by another seven days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is only the third time in New Zealand's 183-year history that a national state of emergency has been declared

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hipkins has warned that the final death toll could rise, but the number of people who police were still looking to contact had fallen to about 2,300
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finance Minister Grant Robertson on Monday pledged NZ$300 million (US$187 million) of relief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We have a long job ahead of us to rebuild after this disaster," warned Robertson, who Hipkins has also made cyclone recovery minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After spending the weekend visiting hard-hit communities, Hipkins said that the national state of emergency declared last week has been extended by another seven days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is only the third time in New Zealand's 183-year history that a national state of emergency has been declared
            </p>

                He said that preparation for the Menu Rahmah meal was the same as other meals in ensuring that the nutritional value is maintained, though the price of the Menu Rahmah meal is much cheaper

                Youth wing members of Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) clad in medieval Islamic war attire, marching with fake swords and shields in Setiu, Terengganu on Feb 17, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Terengganu police chief Rohaimi Md Isa, initial investigations showed that the event took place on Friday (Feb 17) at a resort in Setiu, Terengganu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Police will carry out an investigation to identify any offences in the programme and appropriate action will be taken,” he said in a statement on Monday.  Mr Rohaimi, however, said that the police were not informed about the march involving replicas of weapons, though they were notified of the event earlier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We were not informed about the march with replicas of weapons, which has caused uneasiness and concern among the public,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The march was part of a two-day PAS youth wing gathering, known as Himpunan Pemuda Islam Terengganu (HIMPIT), or Terengganu Muslim Youth Gathering.  Mr Rohaimi added that the march, which was attended by party members from various districts in the state, was part of a design competition involving the theme of clothing, weapons and Islamic heritage.  In a statement on Monday, Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail condemned the march and urged all parties to stop acts that have the potential to create chaos for the people and the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also questioned the intention of the march which was uploaded to social media with an Arabic song in the background emphasising the theme of war.  “This invites the question of whether this parade meant to inject the spirit of war,” said Mr Saifuddin

                Some of his past appointments include Chief Digital Officer at McCann Erickson Worldgroup, CEO of Baraka Telecom, Senior VP of Marketing & Products at Malaysia Airlines, Group Head of Ancillary Income of AirAsia and a trainer and consultant for Airbus Group

                Malaysia’s 5G Single Wholesale Network, Digital Nasional Berhad, has repeatedly warned that a second 5G network would have significant national implications as it will delay deployment and increase the cost of 5G deployment.

                "One of their suggestions is ride-sharing," the Transport Minister told reporters after launching the free shuttle bus service from Kuala Lumpur Sentral to Parliament complex on Monday (Feb 20)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this month, Loke announced that the Land Public Transport Agency (Apad) was currently looking at implementing a ride-sharing pilot project where ehailing and taxi companies offer commuter rides to the MRT stations at lower fares
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said that ridership for public transport such as the MRT (mass rapid transit) could be further increased if first and last-mile issues are resolved

            <p>
                In a related matter, Loke said that Prasarana Malaysia Berhad (Prasarana) will look at using smaller feeder buses aimed at improving first and last-mile connectivity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this would be based on the success of the pilot project which provides a free shuttle bus service from KL Sentral and Parliament complex

                The Education Minister said that to date, the ministry does not recognise the UEC which is implemented in private Chinese secondary schools (SMPC)

                "This stand is based on the National Education Policy and Education Act 1960 which has always been the view of the ministry," she said in a written reply to a question raised by Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang (PN-Marang) in Dewan Rakyat on Monday (Feb 20)

                In November last year, the United Chinese School Committees' Association of Malaysia (Dong Zong) repeated its call for the recognition of the UEC

            <p>
                According to Dong Zong, the SMPC adheres to a curriculum, which includes history as a subject, drafted based on the ministry's standard, as well as having Bahasa Malaysia as a compulsory subject in recognition of the national language under the Federal Constitution and Rukun Negara

                President Chow Chee Yen said the purpose of the tax reduction is to help the M40 with the rising cost of living and increase their disposable income, while the tax increase on the T20 is to alleviate the reduction in revenue collection caused by the tax cut

                Under Budget 2023 tabled on Oct 7, 2022, by the former government, the income tax for the chargeable income band of between RM50,001 to RM100,000 was reduced by two ppt for the year of assessment 2023 -- from 13 per cent to 11 per cent for the RM50,001-RM70,000 band, and from 21 per cent to 19 per cent for the RM70,001-RM100,000 band

            <p>
                Former prime minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s administration also raised the tax for those in the chargeable income bracket of between RM250,001 and RM400,000 from 24.5 per cent to 25 per cent
            </p>

                Meanwhile, he said the return of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) would not be on the cards as Anwar has recently stated that the government would not introduce the broad-based consumption tax

                President Chow Chee Yen said the purpose of the tax reduction is to help the M40 with the rising cost of living and increase their disposable income, while the tax increase on the T20 is to alleviate the reduction in revenue collection caused by the tax cut

                Under Budget 2023 tabled on Oct 7, 2022, by the former government, the income tax for the chargeable income band of between RM50,001 to RM100,000 was reduced by two ppt for the year of assessment 2023 -- from 13 per cent to 11 per cent for the RM50,001-RM70,000 band, and from 21 per cent to 19 per cent for the RM70,001-RM100,000 band

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 20 — The Autism Inclusiveness Direct Action Group (Aida) today condemned Kapar MP Dr Halimah Ali over her remarks linking poor nutrition to cause autism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Her statement gives a wrong impression to the public, further causing immense stigma and belief that autism is caused by poor care and determined by your level of income,” Aida said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aida also said that the group is ready to participate in meaningful dialogues to alleviate any stigma against the autism community
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We strongly urge that policymakers and those in the authority of medical care and its allied practitioners, be mindful, and responsible with how they speak of autism,” said Aida
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, the Autistic peer support group, Autism Initiatives Malaysia also condemned Dr Halimah over her remarks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Having an MP who is a trained medical doctor stating ‘low-quality’ foods to be a cause for autism is appalling as there is no science behind it

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford was on target yet again on Sunday as United ran out 3-0 winners over Leicester City
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Would they be winning their games without Marcus Rashford? No they wouldn’t
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford scored one of United’s two goals in the Nou Camp and will be Erik ten Hag’s main goal threat once again on home soil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They’ve beaten Liverpool, beaten Man City, they are on a roll, but without Marcus Rashford – we’re talking about that game there how fabulous he was second half, and that’s after Rashford has scored a couple of goals
            </p>

                Manchester United take on Newcastle United at Wembley and will be favourites to lift the season’s first silverware

                Liverpool are interested in signing Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski this summer, according to journalist Rudy Galetti
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As well as Amrabat, who was courted by Barcelona in this winter transfer season, [Liverpool are also looking at] Merino of Real Sociedad and Zielinski, whose contract will expire in June 2024 and will most likely leave Napoli at the end of the season,” Galetti said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool have been long-term admirers of Zielinski, as the club even made a bid to sign in from Udinese back in 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As demonstrated regularly this season, Liverpool need runners – players who are going to win the ball in the middle of the park
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, now at 28-years-old, he would only add to Liverpool’s aging squad

            <p>
                Therefore, whilst he is obviously dominating for Serie A league leaders Napoli this season, this is an unlikely transfer to be made this summer.

                “While we are optimistic of the economic growth, we remain cautious over existing global conflicts and the probability of escalation such as in the Russia-Ukraine war as well as inflation rate in the country,” she said in an interview with Bernama
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She added that while recession fears are still looming, the worst is over for many as the majority of markets have shown strong signs of economic rebound, driven by China’s economic reopening after a long closure due to its zero-Covid policy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Opportunities await in Asia, particularly within the renewables and tourism sectors, so long as the country continues to empower the small and medium enterprise and business sector to attract more foreign direct investments (FDIs)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “While Malaysia will continue to experience a volatile market especially for equities due to global circumstances, it will continue to gain traction as the market has been undervalued,” she said

                In a filing to Bursa Malaysia today, the company said the strong recovery in revenue was mainly due to more normalised operations after two years of COVID-19-related disruptions, which resulted in increased revenue recognition from higher construction progress across both the engineering, construction and environment (ECE) division as well as the property development and investment division, and a recovery in overall property sales

            <p>
                "In addition to the contribution from SULSB to the ECE division, higher operating profits were also derived from the property development and investment division in 2022, as a result of much better construction progress and sales from the division’s completed unsold inventory and sales of units from ongoing property development projects under construction

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 20 — The government of the day had it easy with the decision to update current laws to confer automatic citizenship to the offspring of Malaysian women who give birth overseas, Datuk Mas Ermieyati Samsudin said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the former deputy minister in the Prime Minister’s Department under Parliament and Law, when she was in office she had met these families and brought them to meet former de facto law minister Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar who gave his commitment in the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision received commendation from local advocacy group Family Frontiers and the Malaysian chapter of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR Malaysia), which agreed to amend the Federal Constitution so that children born abroad to Malaysian mothers can gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also called for existing laws be made more holistic to address citizenship matters in relation to single citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For example, Ali was born in the UK and will get citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Court of Appeal, in a majority decision on August 5, saw two judges ruling that the overseas-born children of Malaysian mothers cannot automatically be Malaysian citizens

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 20 — The government of the day had it easy with the decision to update current laws to confer automatic citizenship to the offspring of Malaysian women who give birth overseas, Datuk Mas Ermieyati Samsudin said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the former deputy minister in the Prime Minister’s Department under Parliament and Law, when she was in office she had met these families and brought them to meet former de facto law minister Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar who gave his commitment in the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision received commendation from local advocacy group Family Frontiers and the Malaysian chapter of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR Malaysia), which agreed to amend the Federal Constitution so that children born abroad to Malaysian mothers can gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also called for existing laws be made more holistic to address citizenship matters in relation to single citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For example, Ali was born in the UK and will get citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Court of Appeal, in a majority decision on August 5, saw two judges ruling that the overseas-born children of Malaysian mothers cannot automatically be Malaysian citizens

            <p>
                Sacking Tuchel and replacing him with a relative novice in Potter were two hugely naive decisions by Boehly, but there will be no consequences for the Chelsea co-owner, just the chance to play fantasy football again by hiring another manager

                With Chelsea and Potter, the stakes are not quite as high, but unless the team wins the Champions League this season it's unlikely the club will be in European competition next season, and that will have major financial implications at Stamford Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sacking Tuchel and replacing him with a relative novice in Potter were two hugely naive decisions by Boehly, but there will be no consequences for the Chelsea co-owner, just the chance to play fantasy football again by hiring another manager

                Premier League • England Manchester United are willing to stretch to a £250,000 per week wage to keep David de Gea at Old Trafford, according to reports.  But, Erik ten Hag is allegedly already looking at bringing in Leeds United shot-stopper Illan Meslier as his long-term replacement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This new, reported offer is somewhat unexpected, given Ten Hag introduced a rule this season that no United player could earn more than £200,000 per week.  But, the fact that the Dutch coach is willing to compromise to keep De Gea at the club, shows how important he is to the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, according to the Sun, Ten Hag is willing to offer his goalkeeper £200,000 per week to keep him at Old Trafford for at least next season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite De Gea clearly still being important to United, he is already 32 years old, so they are already thinking about a more long-term addition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the Sun’s report, United are very interested in making a move for Leeds’ shot-stopper Meslier and are willing to wait until they can offer him a starting spot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At just 22 years old, the keeper has the potential to get even better than he already is, so United will be hoping that they can seal a deal in the future

                About Us Advertise SYDNEY, Feb 19 — The death toll from Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand climbed to 11 today as thousands of people remained missing a week after the storm struck the country’s North Island
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cyclone hit the North Island’s uppermost region on February 12 and tracked down the east coast, inflicting widespread devastation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, police said two more people had died in the hard-hit Hawke’s Bay area in circumstances related to the cyclone, raising the death toll to 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some 5,608 people remained uncontactable across the country, while 1,196 had registered they were safe, police said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of those, almost 40,000 were in Hawke’s Bay, out of a population of about 170,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Hipkins has said the crisis response is “still underway” and that people across the North Island are “working around the clock.” Police have sent an extra 100 officers to Hawke’s Bay and nearby Tairawhiti, including to isolated areas, and the New Zealand Herald reported roadblocks around a rural Hawke’s Bay village to deter looters

                About Us Advertise SYDNEY, Feb 19 — The death toll from Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand climbed to 11 today as thousands of people remained missing a week after the storm struck the country’s North Island
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cyclone hit the North Island’s uppermost region on February 12 and tracked down the east coast, inflicting widespread devastation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, police said two more people had died in the hard-hit Hawke’s Bay area in circumstances related to the cyclone, raising the death toll to 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some 5,608 people remained uncontactable across the country, while 1,196 had registered they were safe, police said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of those, almost 40,000 were in Hawke’s Bay, out of a population of about 170,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Hipkins has said the crisis response is “still underway” and that people across the North Island are “working around the clock.” Police have sent an extra 100 officers to Hawke’s Bay and nearby Tairawhiti, including to isolated areas, and the New Zealand Herald reported roadblocks around a rural Hawke’s Bay village to deter looters

                Liverpool could be in the market for a defensive player in the summer as Jürgen Klopp's staff look to steal a march on Premier League rivals for a 19-year-old talent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With this in mind, one would posit that Klopp's staff are already working in the background to ensure that Liverpool's squad remains future-proofed

            <p>
                With Trent Alexander Arnold and youngster Calvin Ramsay possibly representing Liverpool's long-term options in the right full-back areas, it would perhaps make more sense for Mantilla to, therefore, be a long-term option for the Reds in the centre of defense

                With question marks currently surrounding Joel Matip's long-term future at Liverpool — he has less than 18 months left on his current contract — one would posit that it makes perfect sense that Jürgen Klopp's staff would be scouring the market for a successor

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, the 19-year-old's ability to potentially play a number of positions across the backline would surely make him an asset for the majority of clubs, including Liverpool

                The Blues' misery under Graham Potter continued on Saturday afternoon, as the Premier League's basement side Southampton won 1-0 at Stamford Bridge thanks to James Ward-Prowse's free kick

            <p>
                The Blues are also facing a last-16 exit from the Champions League following a 1-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund in Wednesday's first leg, with the German side set to visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg on March 7

            <p>
                Out-of-favour striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is also expected to be heading for the exit door at the end of the season, having recently been frozen out of the group under Potter

            <p>
                The former Arsenal man was left out of the Blues' Champions League squad for the knockout stages and has also been cut from the ranks for each of their last three Premier League matches

Walker refused to blame anyone for the draw, despite a lack of goals from their strikeforce The England right-back said it was tough to take the result at the City Ground, especially as it followed such a high with their crucial three points earned against Mikel Arteta's side.   ‘The hard work we did on Wednesday, it hasn’t gone to waste, but this is a blow because you put that good shift in on Wednesday and play a game that we’re not used to with the low percent of possession,' Walker said

However, Walker refused to blame his teammates, despite scoring only once against the newly-promoted side, and Erling Haaland being slated for missing two gilt-edged opportunities to kill the game for the visitors.   ‘We’ve dropped two points here,' Walker said

                ‘That’s not me being down beat but we’ve set such high standards over the last few years that it should be four or five nil, game done and we move onto the next game.' Walker refused to blame anyone for the draw, despite a lack of goals from their strikeforce The England right-back said it was tough to take the result at the City Ground, especially as it followed such a high with their crucial three points earned against Mikel Arteta's side.   ‘The hard work we did on Wednesday, it hasn’t gone to waste, but this is a blow because you put that good shift in on Wednesday and play a game that we’re not used to with the low percent of possession,' Walker said

                Welcome to the ESPN Singapore Edition Mark Ogden believes Liverpool will secure a Champions League finish after their 2-0 win over Newcastle

                Nunez, 23, scored his first Premier League goal since before the World Cup to set Liverpool on course for a 2-0 win over Newcastle at St James' Park on Saturday -- a win which moves Jurgen Klopp's team up to eighth, six points behind fourth-placed Newcastle with a game in hand

                The Reds ended Newcastle's 17-match unbeaten run in the Premier League with a 2-0 win at St James' Park on Saturday.  Jurgen Klopp's side caught Newcastle cold with a scintillating start and the stunned hosts were reduced to ten men in the 22nd minute when Pope was sent off.  The French winger, 25, described the match as 'a very bad day' and pointed out that Pope will miss the Carabao Cup final against Manchester United next Sunday

                The Reds ended Newcastle's 17-match unbeaten run in the Premier League with a 2-0 win at St James' Park on Saturday.  Jurgen Klopp's side caught Newcastle cold with a scintillating start and the stunned hosts were reduced to ten men in the 22nd minute when Pope was sent off.  The French winger, 25, described the match as 'a very bad day' and pointed out that Pope will miss the Carabao Cup final against Manchester United next Sunday

                Premier League • England Everton have sent ’emissaries’ to keep a close eye on Benfica midfielder Florentino Luis, who they are ‘in love with,’ according to reports.  The Toffees were the only Premier League side not to make any signings in January, so Sean Dyche will be in need of reinforcements this summer, regardless of whether they avoid relegation or not
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Record, via Sport Witness, Everton are ‘in love’ with Florentino and sent ’emissaries’ (scouts) to watch him in Benfica’s 2-0 win over Club Brugge on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, if Florentino could keep up his current form in the Premier League for the Blues next season, he could help turn them into a much better side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Liverpool have also registered an interest in the midfielder, so Everton could have some serious competition on their hands for his signature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Everton have endured another very difficult start to the season, currently sitting in 16th place after winning just five of their 23 opening Premier League matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If they want to avoid another relegation scrap next season (if they survive), Everton need to improve their squad significantly, and signing Florentino would be a marvellous start

                Premier League • England Everton have sent ’emissaries’ to keep a close eye on Benfica midfielder Florentino Luis, who they are ‘in love with,’ according to reports.  The Toffees were the only Premier League side not to make any signings in January, so Sean Dyche will be in need of reinforcements this summer, regardless of whether they avoid relegation or not
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Record, via Sport Witness, Everton are ‘in love’ with Florentino and sent ’emissaries’ (scouts) to watch him in Benfica’s 2-0 win over Club Brugge on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, if Florentino could keep up his current form in the Premier League for the Blues next season, he could help turn them into a much better side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Liverpool have also registered an interest in the midfielder, so Everton could have some serious competition on their hands for his signature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Everton have endured another very difficult start to the season, currently sitting in 16th place after winning just five of their 23 opening Premier League matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If they want to avoid another relegation scrap next season (if they survive), Everton need to improve their squad significantly, and signing Florentino would be a marvellous start

            <p>
                Fire officials said the Tesla driver was killed and a passenger was critically injured Saturday when the car plowed into the fire truck parked on a Northern California freeway to shield a crew clearing another accident

                Four firefighters who were in the truck when it was struck on Interstate 680 were treated for minor injuries, said Tracie Dutter, assistant chief of the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District

                About Us Advertise THE HAGUE, Feb 19 — The Dutch foreign ministry yesterday announced the expulsion of several Russian diplomats and the closure of Russia’s trade mission in Amsterdam, accusing Moscow of using diplomatic cover for spying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was the latest development in a dispute over Russia’s failure to grant visas to Dutch diplomats to staff their embassy in Moscow and the consulate in Saint Petersburg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That is why we are limiting the number of Russian diplomats in the Netherlands.” The Russian diplomats being told to leave have two weeks to depart the country, while Russia’s trade mission in Amsterdam had to be closed from Tuesday, said the ministry statement

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In response, Russia expelled 15 Dutch diplomats, and since then talks on naming new diplomats to each country have failed, the Dutch government said

                As a result, “the Russian embassy in The Hague will not be able to have more diplomats than the Dutch embassy in Moscow”, it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dutch media reported that the Dutch ambassador to Russia was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry earlier this week, as Moscow demanded that the Netherlands end its “obsessive” attempts to blame Russia for the disaster

            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this was why they could not agree with the views expressed by the Labuan Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) which opined the bridge was not necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Dahlif also said the other disadvantage of the bridge was that it could reduce the Labuan Port to a secondary role, with businesses and firms choosing to transport shipments between Kota Kinabalu and Labuan using the bridge

                SHAH ALAM Police here are tracking down five suspects believed to be involved in robbing a family of five using machetes in Taman Petaling, Klang on Friday (Feb 17) afternoon

            <p>
                Klang Selatan district police chief ACP Cha Hoong Fong said all the suspects who wore masks and gloves and are believed to have entered the two-storey terraced house through the rear door where they parked their vehicle
            </p>

                SHAH ALAM Police here are tracking down five suspects believed to be involved in robbing a family of five using machetes in Taman Petaling, Klang on Friday (Feb 17) afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klang Selatan district police chief ACP Cha Hoong Fong said all the suspects who wore masks and gloves and are believed to have entered the two-storey terraced house through the rear door where they parked their vehicle

                Local advocacy group Family Frontiers and the Malaysian chapter of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR Malaysia) were swift in commending the Cabinet for agreeing to amend the Federal Constitution so that children born abroad to Malaysian mothers can gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia has for decades been stuck with citizenship laws that were seen as unfair and discriminatory against women, as the Federal Constitution only granted automatic Malaysian citizenship to children born overseas to Malaysian men with foreign wives, but not Malaysian women with foreign husbands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Malaysian mothers were not able to fly back to Malaysia to give birth due to high-risk pregnancies or did not even know the government would reject Malaysian citizenship for their children just because they were born abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also the risk of Malaysian mothers' overseas-born children ending up stateless, such as in the case of Mashithah Abdul Halim whose youngest child is stateless or without citizenship from any country

                Today, Family Frontiers thanked the Cabinet and welcomed its decision to bring the proposed legal changes to Parliament to allow Malaysian mothers the right to confer citizenship on their overseas-born children on the same basis as Malaysian fathers, calling this a "significant step forward"

            <p>
                JOHOR BAHRU, 26 Mac -- Pengerusi Jawatankuasa Hal Ehwal Agama Islam negeri Johor Mohd Fared Mohd Khalid (Semerah) pada majlis mengangkat sumpah jawatan Ahli Majlis Mesyuarat Kerajaan Negeri Johor di Balai Menghadap, Istana Bukit Serene hari ini.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                State Islamic Religious Affairs Committee chairman Mohd Fared Mohd Khalid (pic) said a review needs to be done earlier in efforts to preserve the culture and prevent it from turning into activities that could affect religious beliefs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, a viral video on the TikTok application showed a ‘kuda kepang’ performance believed to have taken place in Johor which is believed to involve elements of worship and possession
            </p>

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb18 — Singapore has recorded its first Covid-19 vaccine-related death after the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced yesterday that a 28-year-old Bangladeshi man likely died due to a vaccination against the coronavirus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The coroner also found that on the balance of probabilities, it was “likely to be related to Covid-19 vaccination”, MOH said without naming the deceased
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the ministry’s Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme, a one-time financial aid of S$225,000 (RM 745,793.13) will be extended to the man’s family

            <p>
                It also said that to date, more than 17 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in Singapore through the national vaccination programme and this is “the first death related to Covid-19 vaccination locally”

                "The president will want to have a conversation with President Xi at the appropriate time."

                "The president will want to have a conversation with President Xi at the appropriate time." White House officials say Biden and Xi last spoke at a November meeting on the island of Bali and both sides saw Blinken's Beijing trip as an opportunity for follow-up efforts to stabilise increasingly fraught ties

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 18 — The Cabinet has agreed to amend the Federal Constitution to enable children born abroad to Malaysian mothers to gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Federal Constitution currently only provides automatic citizenship for children born overseas to Malaysian fathers, while Malaysian mothers are required to apply for their overseas-born children to be registered as Malaysian citizens with no guarantee of success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The only difference for such overseas-born children is whether their Malaysian parent is a father or mother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is despite an amendment to Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution in September 2001 to stop gender discrimination
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Six Malaysian mothers and advocacy group Family Frontiers on December 18, 2020 launched a legal challenge against the discrimination against women in the current citizenship laws in the Federal Constitution which were depriving their overseas-born children of automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian mothers and Family Frontiers on September 9, 2021 succeeded at the High Court which ruled that their overseas-born children are also entitled to Malaysian citizenship, but the Malaysian government on August 5, 2022 won its appeal in a 2-1 decision at the Court of Appeal

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb 18 — Google Singapore yesterday confirmed that it has laid off an unspecified number of employees at its Singapore office, a day after the global technology giant’s India office retrenched more than 450 staff members

            <p>
                In response to queries from TODAY, Google Singapore said that the firm is “unable to share the number of employees impacted in Singapore”, but said that the workers are “part of the 12,000 roles affected globally as previously announced”
            </p>

                Google Singapore added yesterday that Google will “support employees in line with local practices as they look for their next opportunity”

            <p>
                Checks by TODAY on professional networking site LinkedIn showed that several laid-off and retained Google Singapore staff members had made mention of the retrenchment exercise

                One claimed that the number of layoffs in Singapore was 190 employees but TODAY has not been able to verify that figure

            <p>
                The Singapore Ministry of Manpower said last November that 1,270 workers were laid off in the Singapore tech sector between July and November last year

                About Us Advertise LONDON, Feb 18 — The US partner of global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has confirmed that a trading firm managed by Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng operated as a market maker on its platform
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters reported on Thursday, citing banking records and company messages, that Binance had secret access to a bank account belonging to its purportedly independent US partner and transferred large sums of money from the account to the trading firm, Merit Peak Ltd “While there was a market making firm named Merit Peak that operated on the Binance.US platform, it stopped all activity on the platform in 2021,” Binance.US said in a tweet on Thursday after the Reuters story was published
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The global Binance exchange is not licensed to operate in the United States but the transfers to Merit Peak revealed by Reuters suggest that Binance controlled the finances of Binance.US, despite saying publicly that the American entity is “fully independent” and operates as its “US partner.” Binance transferred over US$400 million from the account at California-based Silvergate Bank to Merit Peak between January and March of 2021, Reuters reported on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before that story’s publication, Binance.US had told Reuters that “Merit Peak is neither trading nor providing any kind of services on the Binance.US platform,” without giving further details
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A spokesperson for the global Binance exchange, which did not respond to Reuters’ questions for the story on Thursday, told crypto news outlet CoinDesk that the transfers were “a Binance.US issue.” Zhao, the Binance CEO, said yesterday that the global exchange has pulled back on potential investments in the United States, a move that comes amid growing scrutiny by US regulators of crypto companies so far this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They fell sharply on the Reuters report on Thursday, losing more than 22 per cent

                Premier League • England Manchester United have been cleared to sign one of Erik ten Hag’s primary summer targets with his club, Inter Milan, seemingly setting their sights on his replacement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United’s primary aim this summer appears to be the signing of a new big-name centre forward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition to a new striker, Ten Hag may also look to strengthen his midfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition to the signing of a new midfielder and striker, Ten Hag also has some decisions to make at right-back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, according to Tuttosport, Inter will not stand in United’s way if their price is met
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Inter, for their part, are reported to have identified the man they want to come in as Dumfries’ replacement too

                Premier League • England Manchester United have been cleared to sign one of Erik ten Hag’s primary summer targets with his club, Inter Milan, seemingly setting their sights on his replacement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United’s primary aim this summer appears to be the signing of a new big-name centre forward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition to a new striker, Ten Hag may also look to strengthen his midfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition to the signing of a new midfielder and striker, Ten Hag also has some decisions to make at right-back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, according to Tuttosport, Inter will not stand in United’s way if their price is met
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Inter, for their part, are reported to have identified the man they want to come in as Dumfries’ replacement too
            </p>

                Schectman, who has three decades of experience in the precious metals sector, said that the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) coalition could lead the charge to develop their own reserve currency which would compete against the U.S

                (Reuters) -     Lee Mason has left the referees' body PGMOL by mutual agreement after making a mistake as the Video Assistant Referee in last weekend's 1-1 Premier League draw between Arsenal and Brentford, Professional Game Match Officials Limited said on Friday

            <p>

            <p>
                Mason, a Premier League referee for 15 years, oversaw 287 top-flight matches during that time, with his last coming in the closing stages of the 2021-22 season

                Longstanding issues on connectivity have also hamstrung the region’s development.  Yet, there is renewed optimism from the state government, businesses as well as ordinary Johoreans that Iskandar Malaysia, with the support of the new federal government, could now realise its potential.  The Iskandar Malaysia project was conceptualised in 2006 under the Malaysian government led by then-prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi

                To give a boost to the development corridor, a Malaysia-Singapore Joint Ministerial Committee for Iskandar Malaysia (JMCIM) was set up in 2007.  After co-chairing the last JMCIM face-to-face meeting in August 2022, then-Malaysian economic affairs minister Mustapa Mohamed was quoted by local media as saying that the committee was an important bridge that connects Malaysia and Singapore through Iskandar Malaysia

                Something is very wrong with the stock market, according to a top strategist at JPMorgan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Marko Kolanovic, chief market strategist and cohead of global research at the Wall Street bank, fears retail traders have failed to heed flashing red signals from the bond market in a mistaken belief that inflation has already been defeated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Over 20% of all market volume [is] coming from retail orders,” wrote Kolanovic in a note to clients on Wednesday, adding that this was nearing a record high

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Marko Kolanovic, chief market strategist and cohead of global research at the Wall Street bank, fears retail traders have failed to heed flashing red signals from the bond market in a mistaken belief that inflation has already been defeated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Over 20% of all market volume [is] coming from retail orders,” wrote Kolanovic in a note to clients on Wednesday, adding that this was nearing a record high

            <p>
                In a statement posted on Facebook on Saturday (Feb 18), it said minister Hannah Yeoh, during her press conference on Feb 16, was only urging the private sector to emulate the government's paid internship policies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Feb 16, Yeoh responded to a question from Muar MP Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman during a press conference in Parliament, urging the government to implement paid internship programmes in the private sector

                Fadhlina, who is Member of Parliament for Nibong Tebal, has recently insisted that the school curriculum in Malaysia is comparable to the curriculum in other countries and that the Ministry of Education (MoE) has carried out a study of the school curriculum in this country with other countries such as Singapore, Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and Finland

            <p>
                I do not agree with the Minister of Education Fadhlina Sidek’s statement in saying that our education curriculum is on par with Singapore and Japan,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fadhlina, who is Member of Parliament for Nibong Tebal, has recently insisted that the school curriculum in Malaysia is comparable to the curriculum in other countries and that the Ministry of Education (MoE) has carried out a study of the school curriculum in this country with other countries such as Singapore, Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and Finland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although our education system is the responsibility of the federal government under the Malaysian Constitution, he said the Sarawak government cares by creating a special ministry to improve education in the state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The university subsidised fee, he added, would be almost the same as the fees of public universities such as Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Universiti Putra Malaysia and other public universities in the state

                Also in attendance were PAVB chairman Pandi Suhaili; Bintulu District Education Officer Samri Suhaili and Harakah Islamiah Bintulu Branch (HIKMAH) chairman Yusuff Ali.

                A United States Air Force F-35 fighter jet taxis during the Aero India 2023 air show at Yelahanka air base in Bengaluru on Feb 13, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                India, desperate to modernise its largely Soviet-era fighter jet fleet to boost its air power, is concerned about Russian supply delays due to the Ukraine war and has faced pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The American delegation to the week-long Aero India show in Bengaluru, which ends on Friday (Feb 17), is the biggest in the 27-year history of the show and underlines the growing strategic relationship between the United States and India
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At previous editions of the show, Rosoboronexport had a more central position for its stall, although Russia has not brought a fighter jet to Bengaluru for a decade after India began considering more European and US fighter jets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The F-35 is not being considered by India "as of now", according to an Indian Air Force (IAF) source, but the display of two F-35s at Aero India for the first time was a sign of New Delhi's growing strategic importance to Washington
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked if it would be offered to India, Rear Admiral Michael L Baker, defence attache at the US embassy in India, said that New Delhi was in the "very early stages" of considering whether it wanted the plane

                Azalina pointed out that the Sulu heirs' bid to seize Malaysia's assets is based on the alleged arbitration award by Gonzalo Stampa --- whose appointment as arbitrator has been cancelled by the same court which appointed him initially
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if such a second seizure order does exist, Azalina said Malaysia will fight off such bids in the courts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 24 this year, the District Court of Luxembourg decided to lift or set aside a seizure order on two Petronas subsidiaries and their assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seizure order was previously issued last July 11 upon request of the alleged Sulu heirs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 30, Azalina said Malaysia is also currently challenging an ex parte Exequatur Order — or a May 18, 2022 order which recognised Stampa's purported arbitration award in Luxembourg — before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia continues to dispute the appointment of Stampa as arbitrator and also challenges the entire arbitration process and his award in favour of the Sulu claimants as invalid and illegal

                In his notice of motion, filed on Feb 13, Ahmad Zahid said the High Court's dismissal would prejudice his rights and responsibility as he would have to officially apply to get access to his passport each time he has to leave the country for official work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is seeking for the Court of Appeal to reconsider his application for a permanent release of his passport and said he was ready to accept any conditions imposed by the court

            <p>
                In his supporting affidavit, Ahmad Zahid said Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah had erred when he rejected his application for a permanent release of his travel document

            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid's passport is currently under the safekeeping of the court as part of his bail conditions in his graft trial involving the misappropriation of funds from charity foundation Yayasan Akalbudi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 20, Ahmad Zahid made the application for a permanent release of his passport for him to carry out his duty as the Deputy Prime Minister

                In his notice of motion, filed on Feb 13, Ahmad Zahid said the High Court's dismissal would prejudice his rights and responsibility as he would have to officially apply to get access to his passport each time he has to leave the country for official work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is seeking for the Court of Appeal to reconsider his application for a permanent release of his passport and said he was ready to accept any conditions imposed by the court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his supporting affidavit, Ahmad Zahid said Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah had erred when he rejected his application for a permanent release of his travel document
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid's passport is currently under the safekeeping of the court as part of his bail conditions in his graft trial involving the misappropriation of funds from charity foundation Yayasan Akalbudi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 20, Ahmad Zahid made the application for a permanent release of his passport for him to carry out his duty as the Deputy Prime Minister

                Public Gold Group has launched its first gold dispensing ATM known as Malaysia Gold ATM, at Menara Public Gold, Tun Razak Exchange to enable consumers to purchase physical gold bars conveniently.

            <p>
                He said the Malaysia Gold ATM enabled consumers to purchase physical gold bars with 999.9 purity, which ranges up to five grams per bar, at great convenience

            <p>
