                Ronaldo, 38, who joined Al-Nassr in January in a contract estimated by media to be worth more than 200 million euros ($218 million), hit a ball into the hands of goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic, who kissed the ball in the 68th minute

                Datuk Mohammad Agus Yusoff, director-general of the Community Communication Department (J-Kom) in the Prime Minister’s Department, was responding to a recent YouTuber who accused Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim of selling out Malaysia to China over overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Opposition had manipulated Anwar’s April 4 statement on negotiations with China on oil explorations in an area of the South China Sea that has been subjected to overlapping territorial claims by various nations in an attempt to discredit the prime minister’s leadership

            <p>
                China is claiming almost the entire South China Sea as its territory via its controversial “nine-dash line” on its maps, which cuts into the ZEE area of not only Malaysia but ogther South-east Asian countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Brunei
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s state oil company Petronas operates oil and gas fields within the 200-nautical mile ZEE area and has in recent years had several encounters with Chinese vessels at sea.

                Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has hinted that he could strip Mohamed Salah of penalty duties after the Egyptian missed another spot-kick against Arsenal on Sunday Jurgen Klopp has confirmed that he will hold talks with Mohamed Salah over penalty duties after the Liverpool forward missed another spot-kick in Sunday's enthralling 2-2 draw against Arsenal

                Liverpool and the Anfield crowd fought back though, with Mohamed Salah clawing one back before the break, but the Egyptian was found wanting once again from the penalty spot as he spurned a golden opportunity to bring his side level in the second half
            </p>

            <p>
                Alexander-Arnold experiment Liverpool certainly didn’t help itself in the opening minute of the game, with a nervy opening touch from Ibrahima Konaté resulting in a free-kick, from which Martinelli sent an early warning before Xhaka saw his shot blocked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alisson bites back There’s no denying that Alisson has been Liverpool’s player of the season, and by a comfortable margin

            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Arteta’s Anfield ‘plan’ For all of Arsenal’s dominance in the first half, there was still a clear way back into the game for Liverpool, and there was a genuine argument that they could — and perhaps should — have been at least level at the break
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It certainly seemed to be working until Xhaka targeted Alexander-Arnold with a late challenge, leading to the Liverpool full-back geeing the crowd up and lifting his side in the process, leading to Salah’s lifeline

                His comments risk riling Washington and highlight divisions in the European Union over how to approach China, as the US steps up confrontation with its closest rival and Beijing draws closer to Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine

            <p>
                Citing his prized ideal of EU “strategic autonomy”, the French leader said that “we must be clear where our views overlap with the US, but whether it’s about Ukraine, relations to China or sanctions, we have a European strategy.” “We don’t want to get into a bloc versus bloc logic,“ he added, saying Europe “should not be caught up in a disordering of the world and crises that aren’t ours”

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Macron was “simply talking about the risk of Chinese ‘overreaction’, forgetting China wishes to change the status quo by taking over Taiwan one way or the other,“ Antoine Bondaz of the Paris-based Foundation for Strategic Research (FRS) commented on Twitter

                His comments risk riling Washington and highlight divisions in the European Union over how to approach China, as the US steps up confrontation with its closest rival and Beijing draws closer to Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine

                Citing his prized ideal of EU “strategic autonomy”, the French leader said that “we must be clear where our views overlap with the US, but whether it’s about Ukraine, relations to China or sanctions, we have a European strategy.” “We don’t want to get into a bloc versus bloc logic,“ he added, saying Europe “should not be caught up in a disordering of the world and crises that aren’t ours”

            <p>
                Macron was “simply talking about the risk of Chinese ‘overreaction’, forgetting China wishes to change the status quo by taking over Taiwan one way or the other,“ Antoine Bondaz of the Paris-based Foundation for Strategic Research (FRS) commented on Twitter

                Mikel Arteta admitted that his Arsenal side were nowhere near as good as Liverpool back in 2020 - but the tide has since turned with the Gunners 29 points above the Reds Arsenal can take one step closer to winning the Premier League title when they travel to Liverpool on Sunday - less than three years since Mikel Arteta described the gap between the two teams as "enormous"

            <p>
                This occurred following the Gunners' win over Liverpool in July 2020, when Jurgen Klopp's side had already won the Premier League, while Arsenal were languishing in ninth place

            <p>
                Yudiarso told AFP that their initial suspicion is that the sperm whale found Saturday also died of sickness, “just like the whale found stranded a few days ago”

                Easter is considered the most important day in the Christian calendar as Christians across the world gather at churches to celebrate Jesus' resurrection, which many see as a message of hope and optimism for the future

            <p>
                Joseph Vijayraj, 48, who attended the mass with his wife and three children said that he loved the festive feeling of Easter

                "Since young, I have also always admired how so many people from different backgrounds can come together in solidarity for hope for the future," said Ng, who has been coming to the church for over 10 years with his wife.

                The national average one-year CD rate is currently an annual percentage yield (APY) of 1.68 percent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you were to open a one-year CD today that earns the national average rate of 1.68 percent, the account balance would be around $2,542 when the CD matures in 12 months’ time

            <p>
                An APY of 5 percent, for instance, is more than three times higher than the current national average rate of 1.68 percent for one-year CDs

                Mikel Arteta has praised Arsenal’s Premier League-ready signings for their immediate impact at the Emirates Stadium
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then in January Arsenal signed Champions League winner Jorginho from Chelsea and Leandro Trossard from Brighton

                Since moving from Shakhtar Donetsk, however, the £62million has struggled to find his feet in the Premier League, whereas Trossard has shone for Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It’s great to have a player who has experienced something really nice and positive at that stadium,” said Arteta

                Mikel Arteta has praised Arsenal’s Premier League-ready signings for their immediate impact at the Emirates Stadium
            </p>

                “It’s great to have a player who has experienced something really nice and positive at that stadium,” said Arteta

                About Us Advertise   JOHOR BARU, April 8 — An 84-year-old man who suffered poisoning after eating puffer fish on March 25, was confirmed dead at Enche’ Besar Hajjah Khalsom Hospital, Kluang, this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                State health and unity committee chairman Ling Tian Soon said the victim was the spouse of an 83-year-old woman who died after they ate the fish at noon on the same day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Johor State Health Department (JKNJ) had already taken action when a report on the first case was received and conducted an investigation, identifying the suppliers, wholesalers and sellers involved in the puffer fish transaction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is understood that it was the first time that the couple, who lived at Jalan Sin Tiam Chamek in Kluang, had eaten puffer fish-based cuisine allegedly through a pre-order purchase from a seller through Facebook
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 28, Ling reportedly said that an elderly woman died on March 25, while her husband was warded in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), after both were poisoned after the puffer fish meal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following that, on March 29, Fisheries Dept director-general Datuk Adnan Hussain was reported to have advised the public to avoid eating puffer fish of unknown type because almost all types of puffer fish contain toxins that can cause poisoning if not prepared or cooked correctly

                Dr Noor Hisham said organ donation and transplant services in this country involve organ donation from living or cadaveric (deceased) donors, while the recipients are patients with organ failure problems, involving the kidney, liver, heart or lungs

                Malaysia, he added, has also signed the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism (2008) which states that organs for transplant must be distributed equitably to suitable recipients regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, social or financial status

            <p>
                According to Dr Noor Hisham, the declaration emphasises that the practice of targeting impoverished or vulnerable organ donors must be prohibited because this is seen as brokering for the purpose of transplant commercialism, organ trafficking or transplant tourism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “To tighten clinical governance of organ transplants in this country, the ministry has established a transplantation committee that regulates the organ donation programme among living donors involving the prospective donor and prospective recipient who are not related or donors and recipients who are non-citizens,” he said

                “I don’t want to pre-empt and leave it to the Keeper of the Rulers’ Seal to decide,” he told the media after the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Solid Waste Management and Public Cleaning Corporation (SWCorp) and the Federal Territories Islamic Religious Department (JAWI) to implement a cleanliness programme, here today

            <p>
                In Malaysia, the declaration of the date of Syawal 1, would be made by the Keeper of the Rulers’ Seal immediately after receiving the report of the moon sighting and consent from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who represents the Malay Rulers

                The Gulf News portal reported that the International Astronomy Centre based in the UAE announced that Muslim countries will carry out the obligation to observe the crescent sighting to determine the beginning of the month of Syawal on April 20, which is likely to be the end of Ramadan
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Following Liverpool's 4-1 thrashing at Manchester City last Saturday, Klopp dropped Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson to the bench for the midweek Premier League game at Stamford Bridge

                For advanced safety kit, the second-generation Kona gets the Hyundai SmartSense suite that includes Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA) and a blind spot view monitor that sends a video feed to the driver’s instrument cluster

                The battery-electric variant is called the Kona Electric, and this is offered with two battery capacities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile for the internal combustion versions, the second-generation Kona gets two petrol powertrains
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As with its first-generation predecessor, the latest Kona gets different rear suspension layouts depending on the driveline selected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like before, FWD variants get a torsion beam rear axle configuration which Hyundai says ahas been refined, while AWD versions get a multi-link rear suspension setup that includes a stabiliser bar; the Kona Electric gets the rear multi-link setup of the latter, and all use MacPherson struts for front suspension
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For advanced safety kit, the second-generation Kona gets the Hyundai SmartSense suite that includes Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA) and a blind spot view monitor that sends a video feed to the driver’s instrument cluster
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the United States market, the second-generation Hyundai Kona will arrive in showrooms at dealers in the Northern Hemisphere summer first as internal combustion variants, followed by the Kona Electric in late-autumn this year
