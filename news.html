                Zaid, who is a senior partner of Messrs Zaid Ibrahim, Suflan TH Liew and Partners (ZIST) along with Liew, who is the managing partner of the firm, and partner Rueben, in a Facebook posting last month revealed that he (Zaid) had received a show-cause letter following a complaint from the Bar Council

                Maximum prices per egg in Sarawak are higher at 47 to 50 sen (Grade A), 45 to 48 sen (Grade B), 43 to 46 sen (Grade C), as well as in Sabah at 50 sen to 51 sen (Grade A), 49 to 50 (Grade B), and 48 to 49 sen (Grade C), while in Labuan it is 51 sen (Grade A), 50 sen (Grade B) and 49 sen (Grade C)

                Arnault, 73, born in France, may be most well-known today for his founding and current leadership of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury goods company, but how he got there involved one French Franc ($0.16 USD), real estate in the French Riviera, and condominiums in Palm Beach, Florida
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Around five years into being at his father’s firm, he convinced the company and his father to liquidate the construction division and enter the real estate market — Arnault earned $15 million in the sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Named a company director in 1974, and named CEO in 1977, Arnault started building timeshares on the Mediterranean coast of southeastern France
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shortly after in the 1980s, Arnault moved to the U.S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The French Socialists switched to a more conservative economic course in 1983, prompting Arnault to return to his native France — this is where the one French Franc comes in

                Arnault, 73, born in France, may be most well-known today for his founding and current leadership of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury goods company, but how he got there involved one French Franc ($0.16 USD), real estate in the French Riviera, and condominiums in Palm Beach, Florida
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Around five years into being at his father’s firm, he convinced the company and his father to liquidate the construction division and enter the real estate market — Arnault earned $15 million in the sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Named a company director in 1974, and named CEO in 1977, Arnault started building timeshares on the Mediterranean coast of southeastern France
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shortly after in the 1980s, Arnault moved to the U.S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The French Socialists switched to a more conservative economic course in 1983, prompting Arnault to return to his native France — this is where the one French Franc comes in

                What Are RMDs? You don’t pay taxes on the money in your IRA or 401(k) when you put it in, which is why these accounts are considered tax-advantaged retirement accounts

                Before the SECURE 2.0 Act, or the Securing a Strong Retirement Act, was signed into law, you had to take RMDs following the year you turn 72 or 70.5 if you were born before July 1, 1949

                This, he said, is because the tax reduction in the lower taxable income bands offsets the tax increase in the higher taxable income brackets

            <p>

            <p>
                According to Finance Ministry data, the tax hike represents an additional tax of between 0.4% and 4.6% of taxable income for some 150,000 taxpayers in the higher income group

                On the other hand, those who earn below RM100,000 a year — some 2.4 million taxpayers — would enjoy tax savings of between 12.1% and 16.7% of their taxable income

            <p>

                Affin Bank's fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2022 net profit fell by a third on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to RM138.26mil while the quarter's revenue was marginally lower at RM566.71mil from RM572.13mil in the same quarter a year ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The improvement in pre-tax profit was supported by an increase in the group's net interest income which rose by 13.9% to RM1.02bil compared to FY21 and an increase of 39.3% to RM346mil in the pre-tax profit of Affin Islamic Bank Bhd

                Affin bank president and group chief executive officer Datuk Wan Razly Abdullah said the strong growth profits were also contributed by the gains from our divestment of Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 27 — Treasury secretary-general Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican has said that the government did not want to increase income tax rates for those with annual earnings above RM1 million, as it felt that the top tax rate of 30 per cent was already “sufficiently high”

                About Us Advertise   PUTRAJAYA, Feb 27 — Datuk Seri Najib Razak derailed the entirety of his final appeal at the Federal Court over his SRC International conviction and sentencing last year when he changed his legal counsel at the eleventh hour, prosecutors said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Telling the Federal Court during the former prime minister’s bid to have the apex court’s decision reviewed, ad hoc prosecutor Datuk V Sithambaram said Najib’s bid to change ‘horses’ so close to the scheduled hearing dates was a ‘strategy gone wrong’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sithambaram’s remark echoed his previous argument that Najib was the author of his misfortune and consequently cannot invoke the Federal Court’s inherent jurisdiction to review its own decision in his final appeal hearing last August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, ZIST opted to discharge themselves, leaving Hisyam as the remaining sole counsel in Najib’s defence whose request for dischargement was however denied by the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A five-member panel presided over today’s hearing with Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Datuk Abdul Rahman Sebli leading Federal Court judges Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, Datuk Nordin Hassan and Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abu Bakar Jais on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Nazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal judge, had sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined him RM210 million in default five years imprisonment and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on December 8, 2021.

                Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said one of the causes of Islamophobia is a lack of understanding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Why do people say it (the allocation) is a lot? "We must get people to read the Quran and its translation so that we can understand the religion and save Islam from Islamophobia,” he said after delivering a keynote address at the International Forum on Islamophobia here on Monday (Feb 27)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the tabling of the revised Budget 2023 on Friday (Feb 24), Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said RM10mil would be allocated to translate and distribute the Quran in Swedish and other foreign languages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 27, the Prime Minister announced that the government would print one million copies of the Quran as a symbol of wisdom and maturity to respond to prejudicial and uncivilised attacks on Islam.

                Yesterday, Sanusi posted a lengthy statement on his Facebook page to explain the proposed Kedah Aerotropolis project and urged Anwar to support and approve the project at Kuala Muda, Kedah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Kedah Aerotropolis project will start with an integrated logistics hub which would not require an airport with passenger terminals and that such a facility will be developed if there is demand in the future, noting that the proposed Kulim international airport is just one of the project’s sub-component and will act as an enabler to the entire project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Kedah Aerotropolis project will seek to complement the Penang International Airport in terms of dealing with the projected increase in passengers especially from 2030 onwards
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sanusi said Kedah has so far spent RM28 million for the Kedah Aerotropolis project such as for consultancy fees, marketing works, and project planning, and said the state government hopes a presentation for the project can be arranged soon to enable a detailed explanation to be given to Anwar for a more in-depth understanding of the project
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                It is true that he is probably too good to be on the bench and that could msee us sell in the summer

                Please 🙏 i think he’s a good enough to be in our team its the time.

            <p>
                Tierney is a star,Smith Rowe,Nelson,Jorginho,Trossard these are very good players and its vital to keep them as they are part of what is needed,not a great team but a great squad.

                The figure was based on costs for the wages of employees on sick leave, outpatient clinical costs and the cost to replace workers on sick leave based on overtime payment, he said

                On the ministry’s engagement on Saturday (Feb 25) with Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) and all telecommunications service providers to discuss 5G coverage in the country, Fahmi said a decision on whether to maintain the single wholesale network model in rolling out the network would be reached by the end of March

                Last January, Fahmi was reported as saying that the ministry was expected to make an announcement on the 5G implementation by DNB with several improvements by the end of March.

                On the ministry’s engagement on Saturday (Feb 25) with Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) and all telecommunications service providers to discuss 5G coverage in the country, Fahmi said a decision on whether to maintain the single wholesale network model in rolling out the network would be reached by the end of March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last January, Fahmi was reported as saying that the ministry was expected to make an announcement on the 5G implementation by DNB with several improvements by the end of March.

                China has sought to position itself as a neutral party in the conflict while maintaining close ties with strategic ally Russia

                Chinese state news agency Xinhua quoted Wang as saying China was willing to "deepen political trust" and "strengthen strategic coordination" with Russia

                Eighteen defendants were named in a class action lawsuit filed by one of FTX's customers, with Singapore's Temasek being one of them
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                “During this process, we enquired about the relationship, preferential treatment, and separation between Alameda and FTX, and were given appropriate confirmations that were contractually binding.” It reiterated that its US$275 million (S$370 million) investment in FTX was not for cryptocurrencies, with US$210 million going to a minority stake of about 1 per cent in Bahamas-headquartered FTX International, while the other US$65 million was for a minority stake of about 1.5 per cent in FTX US, the American subsidiary

                The US Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2022 charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding FTX investors, and on Thursday he was handed four new criminal charges in a New York federal court

                The Sekijang member of Parliament also announced an allocation of RM600,000 for the construction of 422 parking lots at Segamat Hospital, which is expected to overcome the congestion issue when the new building starts operating later

            <p>
                Meanwhile, in a separate statement, Dr Zaliha said the government had approved an allocation of RM340 million to repair 400 dilapidated clinics and hospitals nationwide, RM160 million to maintain medical equipment under the Medical Equipment Enhancement Tenure (MEET), and RM100 million to replace obsolete medical equipment
            </p>

                She also described the overall allocation for the ministry under Budget 2023 as a very positive start towards increasing the health sector budget to five per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP)

                Singapore will have a dozen of what is considered the world’s most modern fighter jet by 2030
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen’s announcement of the acquisition during the debate on his ministry’s budget on Friday means that Singapore will have a dozen of what is considered the world’s most modern fighter jet by 2030, which will enhance not just the air force, but also the capabilities of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is a given that the air force and SAF of the future will be more networked, and we fight as one system,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The maintenance cost of the fifth-generation fighter jets has also come down, according to Mr Ang Jer Meng, director of air systems at the Defence Science and Technology Agency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Defence experts said this capability also means the RSAF will be able to keep up combat air operations even without operational, full-length runways in the event of an enemy first strike, complicating any calculations to nullify Singapore’s defences
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The F-35 is also a stealthy jet, as its radar-absorbent material means it is able to evade enemy detection and operate in contested environments

            <p>
                On Friday (Feb 24), Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, when tabling Budget 2023, said beginning this year the income tax rate of resident individuals would be reduced by two percentage points for every income band from RM35,000 to RM100,000
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Friday (Feb 24), Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, when tabling Budget 2023, said beginning this year the income tax rate of resident individuals would be reduced by two percentage points for every income band from RM35,000 to RM100,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister said this was expected to benefit about 2.4 million taxpayers, thus increasing the disposable income of the M40 group by up to RM1,300
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said the tax reduction was in line with the prime minister’s desire to ease the financial burden of those in the B40 and M40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We can see from the structure of society that the T20 covers about 20 per cent of the Malaysian population with a certain income level, the M40 group is of middle income and B40 is of low income

                Here are four things to keep in mind as you plan for a $5 million retirement at age 55
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you manage your assets and plan for retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So if you make the national median income of $70,700 per year, you should plan to have around $570,000 in retirement savings before you stop working
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the other hand, it can take a lot of money to generate meaningful income. Fortunately, $5 million is indeed a lot of money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Medicare, on the other hand, can play a meaningful role in your retirement plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Consider working with a financial advisor to develop a comprehensive financial plan that addresses your income needs in retirement, estate plan and more. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard

            <p>
                The Women, Family and Community Development Minister said most of the cost would mainly come from the need to hire a large amount of new staff to run the department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nancy said when speaking to media after launching the Wanita Bangkit @ KPWKM Entrepreneurship programme on Saturday (Feb 25) that a large number of new staff must be hired and trained for the new department, in addition to the other costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She added that set-up of the new department would likely be done in phases due to budget constraints and that more comprehensive details would only be revealed later on.

                The Women, Family and Community Development Minister said most of the cost would mainly come from the need to hire a large amount of new staff to run the department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nancy said when speaking to media after launching the Wanita Bangkit @ KPWKM Entrepreneurship programme on Saturday (Feb 25) that a large number of new staff must be hired and trained for the new department, in addition to the other costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She added that set-up of the new department would likely be done in phases due to budget constraints and that more comprehensive details would only be revealed later on.

                Dr Ng was speaking during the Committee of Supply debate on his ministry’s budget, where he also noted that defence spending in the current financial year will be a projected S$18 billion (RM59 billion), or a 5.6 per cent increase from financial year 2022

                More info Barcelona's players are adamant that they would have progressed to the Europa League round of 16 at the expense of Manchester United if three more of their stars were available to play at Old Trafford, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second leg at Old Trafford was a game of fine margins, with Barcelona opening the scoring thanks to an early Robert Lewandowski spot-kick before goals from Fred and Antony sent United through to the next round after a 2-2 draw in last week's first leg at the Nou Camp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The occasion also saw Barcelona dumped out of the Europa League for the second season in a row but their players are said to be 'convinced' that things would have gone differently if they had three extra players available for selection.That's according to Sport, who are reporting that the general consensus in the dressing room is that Barcelona would have won if Gavi, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele had played against United on Thursday evening
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They believe that football has been 'very cruel' to them over the course of this season and feel they were unlucky to be drawn into a difficult Champions League group before coming up against United in Europe's second-tier club competition
            </p>
            
            <p>

                More info Barcelona's players are adamant that they would have progressed to the Europa League round of 16 at the expense of Manchester United if three more of their stars were available to play at Old Trafford, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second leg at Old Trafford was a game of fine margins, with Barcelona opening the scoring thanks to an early Robert Lewandowski spot-kick before goals from Fred and Antony sent United through to the next round after a 2-2 draw in last week's first leg at the Nou Camp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The occasion also saw Barcelona dumped out of the Europa League for the second season in a row but their players are said to be 'convinced' that things would have gone differently if they had three extra players available for selection.That's according to Sport, who are reporting that the general consensus in the dressing room is that Barcelona would have won if Gavi, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele had played against United on Thursday evening
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They believe that football has been 'very cruel' to them over the course of this season and feel they were unlucky to be drawn into a difficult Champions League group before coming up against United in Europe's second-tier club competition

                The Federal Court was answering two Constitutional questions referred by the High Court that required answers directly from the apex court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The scheme of the Federal Constitution requires that when investigating a criminal complaint, the relevant criminal investigative body must first consult the Chief Justice before commencing any investigations into a judge of the superior court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, there could not be an investigation against a judge of the superior court without the consultation of the Chief Justice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There cannot be any [investigation] ..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                without permission of the Chief Justice,” said the Indian Supreme Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was in the light of the above that Tengku Maimun saw fit to list out a set of protocols which must be followed when a judge of the superior court is investigated, the first of which is for the relevant criminal investigative body to “first seek leave from the Chief Justice to investigate any Judge.” “The Chief Justice might know details that the investigative body does not and, in any case, informing the Chief Justice is necessary as a safeguard of judicial independence,” said Tengku Maimun

                The Federal Court was answering two Constitutional questions referred by the High Court that required answers directly from the apex court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The scheme of the Federal Constitution requires that when investigating a criminal complaint, the relevant criminal investigative body must first consult the Chief Justice before commencing any investigations into a judge of the superior court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, there could not be an investigation against a judge of the superior court without the consultation of the Chief Justice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There cannot be any [investigation] ..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                without permission of the Chief Justice,” said the Indian Supreme Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was in the light of the above that Tengku Maimun saw fit to list out a set of protocols which must be followed when a judge of the superior court is investigated, the first of which is for the relevant criminal investigative body to “first seek leave from the Chief Justice to investigate any Judge.” “The Chief Justice might know details that the investigative body does not and, in any case, informing the Chief Justice is necessary as a safeguard of judicial independence,” said Tengku Maimun

                “That’s not to say that Liverpool can’t spend big, but every club will almost have to have two strategies come the summer window, one with Champions League football and one without and because in previous seasons, Liverpool have always been able to near automatically budget with Champions League football and bigger spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And this is why many clubs including Liverpool, think that he could perform on the big stage

            <p>
                “I think Spurs are one to watch as well, as we know that they want a centre-back as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because he also has that modern center-back attribute and profile and has drawn a lot of attention because you know Liverpool will always look for value in the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So you know, we have to wait and see on that one now

            <p>
                But I think that centre-back after midfield, or in conjunction with midfield, will be very important for Liverpool.” The Reds are back in action on Saturday evening when they take on Crystal Palace in the Premier League

                “That’s not to say that Liverpool can’t spend big, but every club will almost have to have two strategies come the summer window, one with Champions League football and one without and because in previous seasons, Liverpool have always been able to near automatically budget with Champions League football and bigger spending

                Thus, a Japan Airlines (JAL) passenger was surprised when they were served just one banana after ordering a vegetarian breakfast

            <p>
                In a 21 Feb post on FlyerTalk, a forum for air travellers, netizen Kris_Chari said they’d boarded a flight from Jakarta to Tokyo that morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before take-off, the flight attendant confirmed their order of a vegetarian meal for breakfast
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, they mistakenly assumed she meant that breakfast included a banana

            <p>
                This isn’t the only time a business class passenger was underwhelmed by their food on an airline from North-east Asia

                Thus, a Japan Airlines (JAL) passenger was surprised when they were served just one banana after ordering a vegetarian breakfast
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a 21 Feb post on FlyerTalk, a forum for air travellers, netizen Kris_Chari said they’d boarded a flight from Jakarta to Tokyo that morning
            </p>

                Before take-off, the flight attendant confirmed their order of a vegetarian meal for breakfast
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, they mistakenly assumed she meant that breakfast included a banana

                “EPF is pleased that the Budget 2023 announced earlier today takes into account the demographic changes resulting in an increasing number of an aging population as well as the significant shift in the employment landscape from formal to informal employment,” EPF chief executive officer Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan said in a statement today

                Amir was commenting on the proposal to contribute a one-off RM500 to EPF account holders with savings below RM10,000, extend the i-Saraan matching contribution scheme in 2023, expand the scope of tax relief for voluntary EPF contributions up to RM3,000, and the enhancement of EPF’s shariah savings accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, he said the expansion of tax relief for voluntary EPF contributions to the limit of RM3,000 will encourage more Malaysians to increase their retirement funds
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between 2020 and 2022, EPF members were allowed four early withdrawals of not more than RM10,000 each time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since then, Perikatan Nasional MPs have continued to call for targeted EPF withdrawals to help Malaysians cope with the cost-of-living crisis, but the current unity government has declined to allow it.

                The Health Minister said the pilot project was one of the measures taken by the government to reduce congestion and patient waiting time at hospitals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said the ministry also welcomed the government’s move to impose excise duty on liquid or gel products containing nicotine used in electronic cigarettes or vape of which half of the excise duty will be reallocated to the Health Ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government's commitment to table the Control of Tobacco Products and Smoking Bill together with the Generational Endgame (GEG) can protect the younger generation from the smoking habit and reduce deaths due to diseases related to smoking and vaping, she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Health Ministry received the second-highest allocation of RM36.3bil compared with RM32.4bil in 2022, an increase of 12%

                Core PCE, which removes the volatile food and energy components, is set to show a 0.4% climb over the prior month — ticking up slightly from 0.3% in December — and a marginally slower rise of 4.3% over the year from 4.4% in the last month of 2022

            <p>
                Core PCE, which removes the volatile food and energy components, is set to show a 0.4% climb over the prior month — ticking up slightly from 0.3% in December — and a marginally slower rise of 4.3% over the year from 4.4% in the last month of 2022
            </p>

                "Fed credibility is on the line, and it is likely to risk overshooting rather than quitting the inflation fight too early." — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance

                MoF said funding for Budget 2023 will be sourced from income tax totalling 39.9 per cent of the total allocation, borrowings and use of government’s assets (24.5 per cent), non-tax revenue (19 per cent), indirect tax (14 per cent) and other direct tax (2.6 per cent)

                MoF said in the report that growth in 2022 was anchored by the services sector, which grew by 10.9 per cent and contributed 58.2 per cent share to the GDP, mainly supported by the wholesale and retail trade, transportation and storage, as well as real estate and business services sub-sectors

                The growth was also attributed to robust external demand, especially among Malaysia’s major trading partners, which resulted in a 27.8 per cent increment to RM2.848 trillion total trade last year

                Tengku Maimun said this while delivering a unanimous decision at the Federal Court on Friday (Feb 24) over an application to refer two constitutional questions relating to the MACC’s investigation on Court of Appeal judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali by two lawyers and an activist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tengku Maimun led a seven member panel in reading out the unanimous decision, among them were Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri Amar Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, acting Chief Judge of Malaya Datuk Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah, and Federal Court judges Datuk Nallini Pathmanathan, Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal and Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang.  In the ruling, she said that the protocol was that any investigative body needed to consult with the chief justice (CJ) first, before commencing probes against any judge.  The other protocols were that that public prosecutor must also consult with the CJ if they intend to prosecute the said judge, and facts of the investigation cannot be made public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The questions were posed by appellants activist Haris Ibrahim, and lawyers Nur Ain Mustapa and Sreekant Pillai.  “The failure to consult the chief justice, even if the chief justice is the subject of a criminal complaint, is thus a very strong indication of a lack of bona fides in a criminal investigation,” she said in reading out the judgement via Zoom proceedings on Friday (Feb 24) morning.  The first question pertains to whether criminal investigating bodies are only legally permitted to investigate judges of the High Court, the COA and the Federal Court who have been suspended

            <p>

                Tengku Maimun said this while delivering a unanimous decision at the Federal Court on Friday (Feb 24) over an application to refer two constitutional questions relating to the MACC’s investigation on Court of Appeal judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali by two lawyers and an activist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tengku Maimun led a seven member panel in reading out the unanimous decision, among them were Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri Amar Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, acting Chief Judge of Malaya Datuk Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah, and Federal Court judges Datuk Nallini Pathmanathan, Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal and Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang.  In the ruling, she said that the protocol was that any investigative body needed to consult with the chief justice (CJ) first, before commencing probes against any judge.  The other protocols were that that public prosecutor must also consult with the CJ if they intend to prosecute the said judge, and facts of the investigation cannot be made public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The questions were posed by appellants activist Haris Ibrahim, and lawyers Nur Ain Mustapa and Sreekant Pillai.  “The failure to consult the chief justice, even if the chief justice is the subject of a criminal complaint, is thus a very strong indication of a lack of bona fides in a criminal investigation,” she said in reading out the judgement via Zoom proceedings on Friday (Feb 24) morning.  The first question pertains to whether criminal investigating bodies are only legally permitted to investigate judges of the High Court, the COA and the Federal Court who have been suspended
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The trio’s application to refer the questions of constitutional law to the apex court was allowed by the High Court

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 24 — The nation’s highest court today unanimously held that the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s investigation against judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali did not follow proper protocol
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A criminal investigative body cannot on their own accord publicise or advertise facts of an investigation or contents of the investigation of a superior court judge without prior approval of the Chief Justice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The public prosecutor too must consult the Chief Justice during the course of giving instruction and during the course of investigation and in respect of his decision to prosecute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The curious timing against Justice Nazlan which was done without consultation with the judiciary also cast doubt on whether investigation against Justice Nazlan is bona fide,” she said in delivering the court’s decision through video-conferencing this morning

                In this photo released by China's Xinhua News Agency, rescuers work at the site of a collapsed open pit coal mine in Alxa League in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Feb 23, 2023
            </p>

            <p>
                The open-pit mine operated by small local firm Xinjing Coal Mining collapsed in a landslide on Wednesday, leaving workers buried under a pile of debris half a kilometre wide and an estimated 80m high, said state broadcaster CCTV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Three hundred rescue workers were using heavy machinery and rescue dogs in their search for the miners, state media said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The mine, once underground, was converted to an open-pit operation in 2012, according to state media

                Liverpool were tipped to make a shock transfer swoop for Arsenal star Bukayo Saka, whose current contract with the Gunners is due to expire in the summer of 2024 Bukayo Saka has ended Liverpool's hopes of signing him by agreeing a new contract with Arsenal

                Saka's current contract is due to expire in June 2024 after Arsenal triggered a one-year extension clause, but the Gunners have always been seeking to tie down one of manager Mikel Arteta's most important players on fresh terms

                Saka has helped his boyhood club reach the top of the Premier League table this season, but there were rumours last summer which suggested that Liverpool were lining up a surprise move

                THERE are currently no plans to review the tax structure for the automotive industry, especially the excise duty, says International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz

            <p>
                “Does the government have any plans to review the existing tax structure, which has some impact on vehicle prices, and be able to reduce vehicle prices?” asked Dr Wee, the Ayer Hitam MP, in a supplementary question during Question Time

                Tengku Zafrul said the government has no plans to review the tax structure for the automotive sector, especially the excise duty, which is important to spur the development of the industry

            <p>
                “This (excise duty) is to encourage local vendors to participate in the development of the automotive industry in the country,” said Tengku Zafrul, adding that the government had offered various incentives in the form of exemptions or reductions in excise duty and sales tax, in addition to the waiver of import duty for imported components used in the local assembly of vehicles

                MORE than two-thirds, or some 71%, of active Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributors aged 55 and below do not have enough money in their EPF accounts to keep them above the poverty level, warns Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amirudin had asked the government to state its stance on EPF withdrawals as a way to help ease the people’s financial burden
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also noted that any more withdrawals would only worsen the already alarming lack of savings among EPF members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that any additional withdrawals could also affect EPF’s ability to capitalise on new investment opportunities to ensure sustainable dividend payments to contributors in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that regardless of whether targeted or not, any type of early EPF withdrawal is not the right solution to address the financial burdens faced by contributors
            </p>
            
            <p>

                MORE than two-thirds, or some 71%, of active Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributors aged 55 and below do not have enough money in their EPF accounts to keep them above the poverty level, warns Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amirudin had asked the government to state its stance on EPF withdrawals as a way to help ease the people’s financial burden
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also noted that any more withdrawals would only worsen the already alarming lack of savings among EPF members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that any additional withdrawals could also affect EPF’s ability to capitalise on new investment opportunities to ensure sustainable dividend payments to contributors in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that regardless of whether targeted or not, any type of early EPF withdrawal is not the right solution to address the financial burdens faced by contributors
            </p>

                “As a huge social security institution, EPF must cooperate with government agencies in building and strengthening a holistic and sustainable social security system for the well-being of Malaysians,” he said.

                Manchester United transfer target Frenkie de Jong finally played at Old Trafford on Thursday but was on the losing side as his Barcelona crashed out of the Europa League  Jubilant Manchester United supporters cheekily asked transfer target Frenkie de Jong, 'what's the score?' after their team came from behind to beat his Barcelona at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Notably on the losing side was Dutch midfielder De Jong, who United manager Erik ten Hag made his top target during the summer transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now that his current employers are out of the Europa League, the Old Trafford faithful made sure to ridicule De Jong - who Ten Hag still wants to sign - after the full-time whistle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then half-time substitute Antony made an impact from the bench, executing a superb finish as Ten Hag's men wrestled hold control of the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the first game I thought Manchester United were on top, in the first-half of this game Barcelona really took control of the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second-half Erik ten Hag made the right changes and it was an instant result."  Can United mount a title challenge? Get our FREE daily Manchester United email newsletter

                Manchester United transfer target Frenkie de Jong finally played at Old Trafford on Thursday but was on the losing side as his Barcelona crashed out of the Europa League  Jubilant Manchester United supporters cheekily asked transfer target Frenkie de Jong, 'what's the score?' after their team came from behind to beat his Barcelona at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Notably on the losing side was Dutch midfielder De Jong, who United manager Erik ten Hag made his top target during the summer transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now that his current employers are out of the Europa League, the Old Trafford faithful made sure to ridicule De Jong - who Ten Hag still wants to sign - after the full-time whistle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then half-time substitute Antony made an impact from the bench, executing a superb finish as Ten Hag's men wrestled hold control of the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the first game I thought Manchester United were on top, in the first-half of this game Barcelona really took control of the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second-half Erik ten Hag made the right changes and it was an instant result."  Can United mount a title challenge? Get our FREE daily Manchester United email newsletter

                Some speculate that the wealthy elites are leaving New York because of the state’s high tax rates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That was more than any state in the study

            <p>
                Texas is another warm state that doesn’t have a state income tax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So it’s no surprise that high-income households are flocking to it

            <p>
                Arizona does have a state income tax, but it’s moving towards a 2.5% percent flat tax rate for this tax year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With that rate now in effect, the state now has the lowest flat tax in the country

                Vinicius, 22, scored twice, set up another goal and was voted UEFA's player of the match in Madrid's come-from-behind 5-2 win at Liverpool in the Champions League round of 16 first leg

                This is the way." Vinicius is set to lead Madrid's attack in Saturday's league derby against Atletico Madrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Atletico coach Diego Simeone, whose side have lost twice this season against Madrid, both in LaLiga and the Copa del Rey, is not surprised by Vinicius' rise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the Vinicius we need to win
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The Vinicius that we saw in Anfield is the Vinicius we need in every game." Madrid go into Saturday's game second in LaLiga, eight points adrift of league leaders Barca, who visit Almeria on Sunday

                Diego Simeone speaks about Atletico Madrid's hopes for this year and speaks about Vinicius Jr's form for Real Madrid

            <p>
                Vinicius, 22, scored twice, set up another goal and was voted UEFA's player of the match in Madrid's come-from-behind 5-2 win at Liverpool in the Champions League round of 16 first leg
            </p>

                This is the way." Vinicius is set to lead Madrid's attack in Saturday's league derby against Atletico Madrid

            <p>
                Atletico coach Diego Simeone, whose side have lost twice this season against Madrid, both in LaLiga and the Copa del Rey, is not surprised by Vinicius' rise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the Vinicius we need to win

                In general, the introduction of the new Home Wireless 5G plan has made Celcom the second telco in the country to provide 5G-based wireless broadband service to consumers

                Some speculate that the wealthy elites are leaving New York because of the state’s high tax rates

                Arizona does have a state income tax, but it’s moving towards a 2.5% percent flat tax rate for this tax year

                As your monthly car costs increase, you can dodge a debt default by avoiding two common auto loan mistakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the fact that car prices started to cool off by the end of 2022, a concerning trend of auto loan defaults and car repossessions has started to surface

                For example, if you have $15,000 left to pay on your auto loan and your car is now worth $10,000, that means you have negative equity of $5,000 that you still have to pay

            <p>
                If you can’t pay off your old auto loan out of pocket, you’ll have to roll the negative equity over to your new loan

            <p>
                The older your car, the more likely you’ll have to spend money on repairs and maintenance in addition to your monthly loan payments

                Lawyer Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee, who represented Shafee, confirmed the date of the decision when contacted Thursday (Feb 23)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee was also represented by Datuk Seri Rajan Navaratnam while LHDN senior counsel Norzilah Abdul Hamid and Muhammad Faqrol Syazreen Mohd Ghause also acted for the LHDN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyer filed the application in May 2021, among others, on the grounds that the tax claim was an attack on him as a political victim in his capacity as a lawyer for Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and was considered to be an Umno lawyer even though he was not the party's lawyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 27, 2021, LHDN requested that the suit against Shafee be decided through direct judgment on the grounds that the defendant failed to pay the entire income tax arrears and the tax increase imposed on him amounting to RM9,414,708.32 within the stipulated period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LHDN, which filed the suit on May 6, 2021, claimed that until now, the lawyer had still failed to pay the amount of income tax owed for the Assessment Years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016 including the increase on the imposed sum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee is Najib's lawyer in the case of misappropriation of SRC International Sdn Bhd and 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds

                Only temporary boost to government finances Last week, Subang Member of Parliament Wong Chen called on the government to study the possibility of listing the national oil firm via an initial public offering (IPO) to raise money to help reduce the national debt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Recently, economist Tan Sri Ramon Navaratnam warned that the proposed listing of Petronas on Bursa Malaysia would only give a temporary financial boost to the government

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — The Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) has appealed to the Finance Ministry and the Public Service Department (JPA) to provide the Health Ministry (MoH) the support it needs concerning the public healthcare system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following a townhall session with the Health Ministry in Putrajaya yesterday, MMA president Dr Muruga Raj Rajathurai acknowledged that no immediate solutions were found, but stressed that the session was still an important step towards dealing with medical practitioners’ concerns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We understand from our meetings with MoH that the health minister has been in close engagement with both the MoF and the JPA,” he said in a statement here

            <p>
                As for issues raised during the session, Dr Muruga said they were divided broadly into two categories namely human resources and infrastructure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Under infrastructure, MMA highlighted the need for proper development and maintenance of both physical and digital infrastructure including standardisation and proper maintenance to prevent a collapse of electronic records systems,” he said, adding that MMA would be following up with the ministry on their progress

            <p>

                Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, added that the number of active members who had reached the basic savings target of RM240,000 by the age of 55 had gone down from 36% in 2020 to 29% at the end of last year

                Amirudin had asked the government to state its stance on EPF withdrawals as a way to help ease the people’s financial burden

            <p>
                Anwar also noted any more withdrawals would only worsen the already alarming lack of savings among EPF members

            <p>
                He added that any additional withdrawal could also affect EPF's new investment opportunities and profit-generation for the purpose of dividend payment to contributors in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that regardless of whether targeted or not, any type of EPF withdrawal was not the right long-term solution to resolve the financial burden faced by contributors, especially those who are struggling

                Anwar also noted any more withdrawals would only worsen the already alarming lack of savings among EPF members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that any additional withdrawal could also affect EPF's new investment opportunities and profit-generation for the purpose of dividend payment to contributors in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that regardless of whether targeted or not, any type of EPF withdrawal was not the right long-term solution to resolve the financial burden faced by contributors, especially those who are struggling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As a huge social security institution, EPF must cooperate with government agencies in building and strengthening a holistic and sustainable social security system for the wellbeing of Malaysians," said the Prime Minister

                In the first case, Neo Jing Cong, 23; Wong Chee Keong, 19; and a 17-year-old juvenile were charged with gang-raping the girl at around 1.30am at a hotel room in Bahau on Jan 24 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second case, Wong, the 17-year-old juvenile and another 14-year-old suspect, allegedly gang-raped the girl at another hotel in Bahau at around 2pm on the same day

            <p>
                Deputy Public Prosecutor Goh Hsiao Tung then asked the court not to allow bail as the offence was a serious one involving a young girl

            <p>
                She also urged the court to impose additional conditions if it were to allow bail

            <p>
                Datuk PM Nagarajan, who represented Neo, Wong and the 14-year-old, asked the court to allow bail, adding that the amount should be low as all the accused earned little
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Neo was a site supervisor who earned around RM1,500, Wong was an assistant at a warehouse with a salary of about RM1,200 while the 14-year-old juvenile, a school dropout, would be bailed by his father who was present in court

                In the first case, Neo Jing Cong, 23; Wong Chee Keong, 19; and a 17-year-old juvenile were charged with gang-raping the girl at around 1.30am at a hotel room in Bahau on Jan 24 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second case, Wong, the 17-year-old juvenile and another 14-year-old suspect, allegedly gang-raped the girl at another hotel in Bahau at around 2pm on the same day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deputy Public Prosecutor Goh Hsiao Tung then asked the court not to allow bail as the offence was a serious one involving a young girl
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also urged the court to impose additional conditions if it were to allow bail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk PM Nagarajan, who represented Neo, Wong and the 14-year-old, asked the court to allow bail, adding that the amount should be low as all the accused earned little
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Neo was a site supervisor who earned around RM1,500, Wong was an assistant at a warehouse with a salary of about RM1,200 while the 14-year-old juvenile, a school dropout, would be bailed by his father who was present in court

                In 2008, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Batu Puteh belonged to Singapore, while sovereignty over the nearby Middle Rocks was awarded to Malaysia

                The maritime dispute was originally taken to the ICJ by Malaysia and Singapore in 2003.

                A seismic shake-up of the governance of English football, including the creation on an independent regulator for the elite game, will move closer with the publication of a wide-ranging government white paper on Thursday

            <p>
                It would also have the power to prevent English clubs from joining breakaway competitions such as the European Super League, which six Premier League clubs signalled their intent to join in 2021 before abandoning plans after a fans' backlash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "These bold new plans will put fans back at the heart of football and protect the rich heritage and traditions of our much-loved clubs." The Premier League, which has argued against the need for an independent regulator, said the white paper was a "significant moment" for English football, while the Football Association welcomed the commitment to improve the "financial sustainability and governance of professional clubs." Among the powers of the independent regulator would be to implement a licensing system from the Premier League down to the National League (fifth tier) and requiring clubs to demonstrate sound financial business models before being allowed to compete

            <p>
                The Premier League said it recognised the case for change in football governance and would carefully consider the government's plan for England to become the "first major nation to make football a government-regulated industry." It insists it has taken action to address issues raised in the Fan-Led Review and that £1.6bn is being reinvested down the pyramid over the next three seasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We will now work constructively with stakeholders to ensure that the proposed government regulator does not lead to any unintended consequences that could affect the Premier League's position as the most-watched football league in the world, reduce its competitiveness or put the unrivalled levels of funding we provide at risk," the Premier League said

                With this in mind, Liverpool will need to give themselves some stability in this regard

                Malaysia’s Local Government Development Minister Nga Kor Ming is seen here in parliament on Feb 23, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Based on previous experiences and its benefits to the housing sector, the ministry will continue this kind of sharing session to ensure its policies and actions are more comprehensive and practical,” he said during the Minister’s Question Time in parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The minister was responding to a question by Perikatan Nasional (PN) lawmaker Shaharizukirnain Abd Kadir regarding the government’s rationale for bringing in Singapore housing experts to consult on housing issues in Malaysia given there are urban planning experts in the country.  Mr Nga also noted that under the previous administration, the ministry not only established collaborations with Singapore's Housing and Development Board (HDB) but also with other related housing-related agencies from countries such as South Korea and Australia.  “The government takes a modest and humble attitude in this matter as long as it benefits the people and the country, so what's wrong learning from neighbouring countries, not only Singapore but also Indonesia and Thailand," he said.  Mr Nga added that the engagement sessions with HDB had started in 2018 through a visit by the former housing and local government minister to understand the planning and provisions of housing in Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also noted that the HDB has received various awards and recognition at the international level related to the housing sector
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We see the success of HDB and they have managed to build more than one million units of affordable social housing,” he said.  “Actually, we are not only learning from Singapore but also from Türkiye as one of the efforts to advance the country, bringing development to all parties regardless of race.” In January, Mr Nga denied a report which claimed that the government had to bring in experts from Singapore to resolve Malaysia’s housing issues due to an “inefficient” civil service that handles public housing.  “Our intention to invite foreign experts, including from Singapore, for seminars and workshops, is to gain knowledge and share expertise in the field of housing so that Malaysia can move forward and be in step with current developments,” he was quoted as saying by Bernama.  Mr Nga also said at that time that the ministry’s staff had always provided the best service while implementing affordable and holistic housing policies for the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was also previously reported that Mr Nga’s plan to invite Singapore experts in a move to build more affordable homes in Malaysia was criticised by the opposition

                As your monthly car costs increase, you can dodge a debt default by avoiding two common auto loan mistakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the fact that car prices started to cool off by the end of 2022, a concerning trend of auto loan defaults and car repossessions has started to surface

            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if you have $15,000 left to pay on your auto loan and your car is now worth $10,000, that means you have negative equity of $5,000 that you still have to pay
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you can’t pay off your old auto loan out of pocket, you’ll have to roll the negative equity over to your new loan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The older your car, the more likely you’ll have to spend money on repairs and maintenance in addition to your monthly loan payments

                For the full FY2022, Genting’s net loss narrowed to RM299.91 million from RM1.37 billion a year earlier due to higher adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and lower pre-opening expenses

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — Former Klang MP Charles Santiago today questioned how chicken and eggs can remain affordable for the B60 or those in the bottom 60 per cent income tier in Malaysia if the government removes the maximum selling price after June, given that just a few companies dominate production of these food items
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He called for transparency in the government’s removal of price controls or plan to float the prices of chicken and eggs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Given that eight firms control 65 per cent of production, how will the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS) ensure chicken and egg prices remain affordable to the B60 while also meeting self-sufficiency needs? “As this dominance is alarming, the Malaysia Competition Commission should release its findings on cartel activities in the industry before the float is introduced, especially since the findings have been pending for too long now,” he said in a statement, without naming those eight companies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As such, transparency is key, and the responsibility is on the government to make all information public,” he concluded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, the government has imposed price controls to only allow the maximum retail selling price in peninsular Malaysia for chicken to be at RM9.40 per kg, and the highest allowed selling price for eggs to be at 45 sen (Grade A), 43 sen (Grade B) and 41 sen (Grade C)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The maximum selling price in Langkawi, Labuan, Sabah and Sarawak depends on the different zones and districts there.

                Siti Bainun, 31, said she had also seen the injuries while Bella lived in the condominium, but denied that she had neglected Bella when the teenager was in her care

                Siti Bainun who was accused of neglecting and abusing the 13-year-old girl, said this during cross-examination by deputy public prosecutor Zahida Zakaria at her defence trial on Thursday (Feb 23)

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Questioned by another deputy public prosecutor Zilfinaz Abbas, Siti Bainun said she never left her children including Bella without adult supervision if she went out because a former resident of the house Yasmin Nahar Mahmood (the fifth prosecution witness) would be in the condominium
            </p>

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — Lynas Malaysia did not pay single sen in corporate taxes as it had been given tax-exempt status by the government for 12 years, Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Chang Lih Kang said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Since Lynas’ operations in 2012, not a single sen of corporate taxes have been paid because the government had given it tax-exempt status for 12 years,” he said in his winding-up speech at Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that the government was providing both certainty and consistency in reaffirming the decision it had made in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If the government makes one decision in 2020 and a different one in 2023, this would be seen as flip-flopping
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also clarified that the government is not closing down Lynas Malaysia’s operations, but merely not allowing its request to the government to drop the conditions imposed on it in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the licence could be revoked if it does not comply with four conditions that have been set out by the government, he warned

                More Info The Iraqi central bank announced Wednesday that, for the first time, it plans to allow trade from China to be settled directly in yuan instead of the US dollar to improve access to foreign currency

            <p>
                A second option to boost local banks’ yuan balances would involve converting US dollars held in the central bank’s accounts with JP Morgan and the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) to yuan before paying the final beneficiary in China

                “As littoral states in the South China Sea, Indonesia and China will work with other ASEAN member states to implement the declaration of conduct on the South China Sea and accelerate the negotiations for a code of conduct.” The ministers did not mention when the negotiations would take place but earlier this month, Mdm Marsudi had said that they would take place in March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The South China Sea is one of the most contested waters in the world.  China claims much of the South China Sea based on a nine-dash line map it uses to claim the waters which Indonesia considers as lacking international legal basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ASEAN countries have been trying to negotiate a code of conduct with China since the 1990s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides the South China Sea, the foreign ministers also talked about the Myanmar crisis.  Mdm Marsudi expressed her appreciation for China supporting the Five-Point of Consensus to end the violence in Myanmar following the February 2021 coup.  “The Five-Point of Consensus is the main reference for ASEAN to help Myanmar out of its political crisis,” she said referring to the consensus adopted by ASEAN leaders in Jakarta in April 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During a meeting in April 2021, all ASEAN leaders reached a consensus about the situation in Myanmar

                “As littoral states in the South China Sea, Indonesia and China will work with other ASEAN member states to implement the declaration of conduct on the South China Sea and accelerate the negotiations for a code of conduct.” The ministers did not mention when the negotiations would take place but earlier this month, Mdm Marsudi had said that they would take place in March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The South China Sea is one of the most contested waters in the world.  China claims much of the South China Sea based on a nine-dash line map it uses to claim the waters which Indonesia considers as lacking international legal basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ASEAN countries have been trying to negotiate a code of conduct with China since the 1990s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides the South China Sea, the foreign ministers also talked about the Myanmar crisis.  Mdm Marsudi expressed her appreciation for China supporting the Five-Point of Consensus to end the violence in Myanmar following the February 2021 coup.  “The Five-Point of Consensus is the main reference for ASEAN to help Myanmar out of its political crisis,” she said referring to the consensus adopted by ASEAN leaders in Jakarta in April 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During a meeting in April 2021, all ASEAN leaders reached a consensus about the situation in Myanmar

                Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob (BN-Bera) then stood up to say that the government should allow a targeted withdrawal for those who qualified and had enough savings

                Tong said that based on current sentiment, 94 per cent of developers in its survey attributed that having access to end financing for homebuyers continue to be the main challenge for homebuyers

            <p>
                "To counter the price increase in building materials, developers have no choice but to increase property selling prices (double digit on average) or lower their profit margin,” said Tong

            <p>
                Tong said 61 per cent of respondents had planned to launch their projects in 1H 2023, but the majority (83 per cent) viewed that their sales performance would record 50 per cent and below
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was supported by the optimism in the domestic economic environment sentiment of 70 per cent in 2H 2023 against 51 per cent in 1H 2023, and higher consumer purchasing power of 60 per cent in 2H 2023 from 44 per cent in 1H 2023 in the survey

            <p>
                To boost sales for the 1H 2023, he said, the survey outlined three top measures that include aggressive participation in digital marketing and virtual technology; assist with first 10 per cent in downpayment; and offer special rebates namely for second property purchased from the same developer (referral rebates)

                The MCA president used a short poem to ask Works Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi about the status of the much-needed project during a Parliament session on Wednesday (Feb 23)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nanta then replied that the proposal had been reviewed by the ministry which is also in agreement that the expansion is needed for the four-lane highway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The first phase will be the construction of an additional lane for both sides of the highway from Yong Peng Utara to Sedenak as part of Rolling Plan 3 (RP3)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Wee then asked when the construction of the new lanes was likely to begin, and Nanta replied it would start very soon if approved and included in Budget 2023 by the Finance Ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We sent our proposal to the Finance Ministry for review but the approval for the allocation of the funding needed will be subject to the priority and financial status of the government in Budget 2023," Nanta said.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin has today confirmed the resignation Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan as Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) information chief from today, The Bersatu president however said this decision is not an acknowledgement that Wan Saiful is guilty

            <p>
                This was in response to DAP Kepong MP Lim Lip Eng’s question on the status of the establishment of the Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission (IPCMC)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bill was later replaced when Perikatan Nasional (PN) took the government, with the Independent Police Conduct Commission Bill
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously announced in October 2022 that the EV maker is working on a next-generation platform that would be half the price of the Model 3 and Model Y, and a model that is set to be priced in the region of US$25,000 (RM111,025) is expected to make its debut in 2023, this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The idea of a more affordable Tesla model was put forth by Musk as early as 2018, at which time the CEO said the company could produce in three years from that time, or 2021
            </p>

                When June 2021 rolled around, Musk said that the new model, which will be a hatchback, is planned for a 2023 debut
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One way that Tesla could manage costs with the new model is with its tabless 4680 battery cell design, which the company revealed at its Battery Day event in September 2020

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan said today he has offered to relinquish his information chief position in the party due to his ongoing court case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But let this decision be made by the top leadership,” Wan Saiful told a press conference here at the Parliament building here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that his position as the information chief is an executive position, it was rightful that he relinquished it until he is able to prove his innocence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Wan Saiful claimed trial for two bribery charges at the Sessions Court here, in connection with the government’s Jana Wibawa scheme back in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second charge, Wan Saiful was accused of receiving RM6,962,694.54 from Nepturis in relation to the same government road project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sessions Court judge Azura Alwi set bail at RM400,000 and told Wan Saiful that he has to surrender his passport to the court before March 22.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan said today he has offered to relinquish his information chief position in the party due to his ongoing court case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But let this decision be made by the top leadership,” Wan Saiful told a press conference here at the Parliament building here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that his position as the information chief is an executive position, it was rightful that he relinquished it until he is able to prove his innocence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Wan Saiful claimed trial for two bribery charges at the Sessions Court here, in connection with the government’s Jana Wibawa scheme back in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second charge, Wan Saiful was accused of receiving RM6,962,694.54 from Nepturis in relation to the same government road project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sessions Court judge Azura Alwi set bail at RM400,000 and told Wan Saiful that he has to surrender his passport to the court before March 22.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 22 — The suspension of rail services since January was due to structural damage of the viaduct and cracked pier near the Bandaraya LRT station, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said today

            <p>

                South Korea's rural development agency in December estimated the North's crop production at around 4.5 million tonnes last year, 3.8 per cent down from 2021, citing heavy summer rains and other weather conditions

                Most UN agencies and Western relief groups have since left North Korea, with China remaining one of the few sources of external food assistance

                "Food production dropped from last year, and there is a possibility of distribution issues due to a change in their food supply and distribution policy," a ministry official told reporters

                South Korea's rural development agency in December estimated the North's crop production at around 4.5 million tonnes last year, 3.8 per cent down from 2021, citing heavy summer rains and other weather conditions

                Unification Minister Kwon Young-se has said Pyongyang had asked the UN food agency, the World Food Programme, to provide support but there was no progress because of differences over monitoring issues

            <p>
                The agency has not responded to a request for comment.

                One patent was revoked by the High Court in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Friday, in a landmark decision which addressed novel points of patent law, the Court of Appeal ordered the second patent to be revoked as it was not sufficiently clear and complete

            <p>
                One patent, identified as SG 508, relates to a method of changing the colour of a lab-grown diamond by heat treatment

            <p>
                Under the Patents Act, a patent is valid only if it discloses the invention “in a manner which is clear and complete”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court found that the patent was not sufficiently clear, as it did not set out the method to allow a skilled person reading the patent to grow the lab-grown diamond
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court found that the patent was also insufficient because it was “uncertain” – even if a skilled person grew a diamond, he would not know whether that diamond infringed Element Six’s patent.

                The jobless man pleaded not guilty when the charges under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act were read to him before Sessions Court Judge Azizah Ahmad yesterday

            <p>
                When requesting the court for a lower bail, his lawyer Dayang Nor Emilia Azman Shah said the accused has a four-month-old baby with the victim’s mother and had lost his job as a lorry driver
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azizah set bail at RM3,000 for each charge with one surety and March 22 for mention

            <p>
                When met after the court proceedings, Dayang Nor Emilia said the accused and the victim’s mother were not married but had stayed together

                Faizan pleaded guilty after being read the charge under Regulation 16(1)(b) of the Communications and Multimedia (Technical Standards) Regulations, which was read together with Regulation 16(3) of the same regulations
            </p>

                Alisson Becker — 5 That mistake to gift Real Madrid the equalizer unfortunately cemented his rating

            <p>
                Virgil van Dijk — 5 Less to blame for the Real Madrid goals

                Jordan Henderson — 6 Was one of Liverpool's better players
