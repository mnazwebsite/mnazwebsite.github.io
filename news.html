                Emilia Hanafi, 43, said that she chose to work part-time because she had to manage the schooling of her three sons, aged 17, 12 and 10, including dropping them off and fetching them from school
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seventh prosecution witness told the court that she took up a part-time job to support the family, including her three sons, for whom the interim maintenance of RM2,000 received for each child was insufficient
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Emilia testified on Thursday, after the court allowed the application of lawyer, Datuk Akberdin Abdul Kader, who represented SM Faisal, for Emilia to be called to testify despite objection from the prosecution

            <p>
                DPP Zahida Zakaria, however, informed the court that she would file a revision application against the court's order for Emilia to testify on Thursday

            <p>
                Thursday’s hearing was supposed to proceed with the sixth prosecution witness, Elisa Nani, who is Emilia's younger sister, to be cross-examined by the lawyer, but Akberdin applied for Emilia be called to testify first, because she is an important witness for the prosecution

                Hock Peng filed an application to strike out the suit on March 22, 2021, saying, among others, that the assessment years 2011 and 2012, as well as the additional assessments for 2013 and 2014, were invalid because they were made more than five years from the year of assessment on the income claimed to have accrued without complying with Section 91(3) of the Income Tax Act 1967

            <p>
                Joanna Yu, who is the 41st prosecution witness in the RM2.28bil 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) graft trial involving Najib, has consistently told the High Court that she dealt with Low, or better known as Jho Low, to get instructions on Najib's accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low's denial was brought up by Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah here at the High Court on Thursday (Feb 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defence has previously contended that Low was the "mastermind" behind the 1MDB scandal while Yu testified before that she would receive instructions from Low on managing Najib's bank account whenever she could not get hold of Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, who is the mandate holder to Najib's bank accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness said she was unsure how the questions were posed to Low by the MACC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness also said she had rejected job offers from Low several times because she did not want to work according to Low's lifestyle
            </p>
              
                		<p> </p>

                Thursday, 02 Feb 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joanna Yu, who is the 41st prosecution witness in the RM2.28bil 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) graft trial involving Najib, has consistently told the High Court that she dealt with Low, or better known as Jho Low, to get instructions on Najib's accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low's denial was brought up by Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah here at the High Court on Thursday (Feb 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defence has previously contended that Low was the "mastermind" behind the 1MDB scandal while Yu testified before that she would receive instructions from Low on managing Najib's bank account whenever she could not get hold of Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, who is the mandate holder to Najib's bank accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness said she was unsure how the questions were posed to Low by the MACC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness also said she had rejected job offers from Low several times because she did not want to work according to Low's lifestyle
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                In the statement of claim, Mohd Hatta said Dr Mahathir, who was then the seventh prime minister, had committed tort misfeasance in public office when he decided to postpone the HSR project, causing the government and the Malaysian people to pay compensation of almost RM46 million to the Singapore government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that Muhyiddin, who was then the eighth prime minister, also committed tort misfeasance in public office for terminating the project, causing the Malaysian government and the people to pay RM320,270,519.24 as compensation for the cancellation of the Bilateral Agreement between Malaysia and Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Hatta claimed that Mustapha, who was responsible for managing the project, had committed a similar offence by shelving the project, while Wee committed tort misfeasance in public office for denying the Malaysians their right to enjoy a first-class transport system with the cancellation of the HSR project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is seeking a court order to declare the cancellation of the project null and void, as well as for all the defendants to pay RM1 million compensation to him and all Malaysians for wrongfully and negligently cancelling the HSR project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 1, 2021, Malaysia and Singapore announced the termination of the 350-kilometre HSR project as the two countries failed to reach an agreement on changes proposed by Malaysia before the expiry of the project agreement on December 31, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Accordingly, Malaysia paid S$102.8 million (RM320.27 million) to Singapore for costs incurred for the development of the HSR project

                In the statement of claim, Mohd Hatta said Dr Mahathir, who was then the seventh prime minister, had committed tort misfeasance in public office when he decided to postpone the HSR project, causing the government and the Malaysian people to pay compensation of almost RM46 million to the Singapore government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that Muhyiddin, who was then the eighth prime minister, also committed tort misfeasance in public office for terminating the project, causing the Malaysian government and the people to pay RM320,270,519.24 as compensation for the cancellation of the Bilateral Agreement between Malaysia and Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Hatta claimed that Mustapha, who was responsible for managing the project, had committed a similar offence by shelving the project, while Wee committed tort misfeasance in public office for denying the Malaysians their right to enjoy a first-class transport system with the cancellation of the HSR project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is seeking a court order to declare the cancellation of the project null and void, as well as for all the defendants to pay RM1 million compensation to him and all Malaysians for wrongfully and negligently cancelling the HSR project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 1, 2021, Malaysia and Singapore announced the termination of the 350-kilometre HSR project as the two countries failed to reach an agreement on changes proposed by Malaysia before the expiry of the project agreement on December 31, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Accordingly, Malaysia paid S$102.8 million (RM320.27 million) to Singapore for costs incurred for the development of the HSR project

                Describing it as another significant victory for Malaysia against the self-claimed heirs, Azalina said the Spanish Court's annulment of Stampa’s appointment as arbitrator is final and reaffirms Malaysia’s position on the arbitration case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On June 29, 2021, the High Court of Justice of Madrid (HCJM) issued a decision that annulled the judicial appointment of Stampa to act as an arbitrator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stampa was initially appointed arbitrator in 2019 by the HCJM without Malaysia being involved in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The self-claimed Sulu claimants recognised that Stampa was not an arbitrator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This constitutional appeal did not say the effects of the annulment decision and as such, his Stampa's termination was already final and binding since a court decision on June 29, 2021, Azalina said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azalina said that the Spanish Constitutional Court had rejected the constitutional appeal filed by the Sulu claimants because they had withdrawn their claim to appoint an arbitrator following the annulment decision

                Liverpool and Michael Edwards help to put Chelsea's incredible transfer spending spree into perspective

            <p>
                In fact, remarkably, Boehly has spent more on incomings in the past six months than Michael Edwards did during his entire tenure as Liverpool’s sporting director
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having been appointed by FSG in November 2016, he guided Liverpool through 11 transfer windows, signing the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Alisson Becker, Mohamed Salah and Fabinho to name but a few
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His behaviour in the market allowed FSG's sell-to-buy transfer policy to prosper
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reds will require significant investment into their engine room when the transfer window reopens in the summer, with Liverpool appearing desperately in need of quality and fresh legs in the middle of the park
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It will cost money to fix that problem, but it remains to be seen whether FSG has the same desire and financial power as Boehly does at Chelsea

            <p>
                His behaviour in the market allowed FSG's sell-to-buy transfer policy to prosper
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reds will require significant investment into their engine room when the transfer window reopens in the summer, with Liverpool appearing desperately in need of quality and fresh legs in the middle of the park
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It will cost money to fix that problem, but it remains to be seen whether FSG has the same desire and financial power as Boehly does at Chelsea

                'No one believed he was one of ours.' Enzo Fernandez joined Chelsea in a British record £107million transfer from Benfica Fernandez is the latest star arrival at Chelsea following a January of heavy spending by the club Even during his boyhood years in his home nation of Argentina Fernandez was in-demand There is a River Plate shirt signed by Fernandez proudly displayed on the club wall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There had been a clamour for Fernandez to start that match
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fernandez (red) has the ability to become Chelsea's newest midfield leader after joining from Benfica Fernandez won the World Cup with Argentina alongside national hero Lionel Messi in Qatar 'Make sure you shoot, you'll score,' Pablo Esquivel, who had discovered five-year-old Enzo at La Recova, told him in a text message on the eve of that Mexico game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Messi who played him in and Fernandez's goal made him the youngest player (21 years and 313 days) since Messi (18 years and 257 days) to score in a World Cup group game for his country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fernandez can claim to have twice helped prevent Messi from retiring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By then Fernandez will be a year into life in west London and Chelsea will know if, as it was for La Recova, it is always worth doing whatever it takes to have him on your side.

                'No one believed he was one of ours.' Enzo Fernandez joined Chelsea in a British record £107million transfer from Benfica Fernandez is the latest star arrival at Chelsea following a January of heavy spending by the club Even during his boyhood years in his home nation of Argentina Fernandez was in-demand There is a River Plate shirt signed by Fernandez proudly displayed on the club wall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There had been a clamour for Fernandez to start that match
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fernandez (red) has the ability to become Chelsea's newest midfield leader after joining from Benfica Fernandez won the World Cup with Argentina alongside national hero Lionel Messi in Qatar 'Make sure you shoot, you'll score,' Pablo Esquivel, who had discovered five-year-old Enzo at La Recova, told him in a text message on the eve of that Mexico game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Messi who played him in and Fernandez's goal made him the youngest player (21 years and 313 days) since Messi (18 years and 257 days) to score in a World Cup group game for his country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fernandez can claim to have twice helped prevent Messi from retiring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By then Fernandez will be a year into life in west London and Chelsea will know if, as it was for La Recova, it is always worth doing whatever it takes to have him on your side.

                Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex settled Wednesday’s trade down $2.50 at $1,942.80 an ounce
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But after Powell spoke, the benchmark gold futures contract soared to $1,969.05 — its highest since April last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The $1,950 resistance had been viewed as a critical barrier for gold to break if the precious metal were to advance to the virtual record high of $2,078 attained in April last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since the start of 2023, gold futures have gained almost 8%, while spot gold has risen nearly 7%

                Sabitzer, 28, had become frustrated at a shortage of game time at Bayern since Julian Nagelsmann, his coach at Leipzig, took him to the Allianz Arena with him in the summer of 2021

                Sabitzer is welcomed to Bayern in the traditional manner after joining the club in August 2021 Sabitzer was a Bayern fan as a kid and once failed miserably in a trial there when he was 14 But Sabitzer's (left) time at Bayern had seen game time severely restricted in big games Ralf Rangnick, well known to United fans, was director of football for both Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg when he identified Sabitzer as a promising player at Rapid Vienna and signed him to the German club in 2014

                Erik ten Hag has told Jadon Sancho to keep smiling after the Manchester United forward made his return to football for the first time in three months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Most important players enjoy football, which gives energy, that gives them the motivation to act and to perform," Ten Hag told a news conference

                "He's just started again, he's back at Carrington for two weeks, we see that smile and hopefully he can keep that and contribute to the team." United beat Forest to book their place in a Wembley final for the first time since 2018

            <p>
                Ten Hag is on course to end a trophy drought which stretches back to the Europa League success under Jose Mourinho in 2017 but the Dutchman admits his team will first have to navigate a busy schedule
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We are aware of it but I have handled this before when I have to play a cup game after we play in Europe with Ajax so I know how to deal with it," said Ten Hag

                Determining How Much You Have You may think that you have $1.5 million for retirement, but a closer inspection of your assets and income streams may make you realize you have more

                Taking a thorough inventory can help you determine not only how long $1.5 million will last, but how much you can reasonably spend each year.  Retirement Assets  In addition to your $1.5 million, you may have other assets that can be used to supplement your income at a later date or will be included in your estate for your heirs

                Retire early? As the old saying goes, that’s good work if you can get it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why is that plan, in the words of economist Laurence Kotlikoff, “one of the worst money mistakes” you can make? For starters, the market has since retreated, erasing many of the pandemic’s gains and waking many from their early-retirement dreams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are, as a group, lousy savers, making early retirement unaffordable,” Kotlikoff wrote in a guest column for CNBC last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unexpected health expenses — never mind long-term care — are significant drains on retirement funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Social Security is currently on a timer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Economists have long warned against overly relying on Social Security, and many of them urge investors to build retirement plans that assume the program will be gone

                Retire early? As the old saying goes, that’s good work if you can get it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why is that plan, in the words of economist Laurence Kotlikoff, “one of the worst money mistakes” you can make? For starters, the market has since retreated, erasing many of the pandemic’s gains and waking many from their early-retirement dreams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are, as a group, lousy savers, making early retirement unaffordable,” Kotlikoff wrote in a guest column for CNBC last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unexpected health expenses — never mind long-term care — are significant drains on retirement funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Social Security is currently on a timer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Economists have long warned against overly relying on Social Security, and many of them urge investors to build retirement plans that assume the program will be gone
            </p>

                “Today, we activated the QRT at KLIA, which comprises 30 JIM officers who will be on duty at 26 counters at the international arrival hall during peak hours between 2pm and 8pm every day

                About Us Advertise PASIR GUDANG, Feb 1 — Johor PKR lawmaker Hassan Abdul Karim today urged Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to reconsider the appointment of his daughter, Nurul Izzah as his senior adviser, amid backlash and nepotism accusations from the public

                Members of the Incident Management Team coordinate the search for a radioactive capsule that was lost in transit by a contractor hired by Rio Tinto, at the Emergency Services Complex in Cockburn, Australia, in this undated handout photo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Caesium-137 capsule lost in transit more than two weeks ago was discovered when a vehicle travelling at 70 kms per hour equipped with specialist detection equipment picked up the radiation, according to officials from the state of Western Australia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The search team then used portable detection equipment to find the capsule, which was located about 2 metres from the side of the road in a remote area far from any community, they added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The radioactive capsule was part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed from Rio Tinto's  Gudai-Darri mine in the state's remote Kimberley region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                People had been told to stay at least five metres (16.5 feet) away if they spotted the capsule, because exposure could cause radiation burns or radiation sickness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Western Australia's Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said the find was an "extraordinary result" after a search involving the state's emergency response department, defence authorities and radiation specialists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Western Australia's Chief Health Officer Andrew Robertson said there would be an investigation and prosecutions would be considered under state radiation safety laws from 1975

                New home prices rose month-on-month in 12 cities, up from 10 in December, according to the survey by China Index Academy (CIA), one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms

                China's property sector, accounting for a quarter of the economy, has struggled with defaults and stalled projects, hitting market confidence and weighing on economic growth

                The survey also showed six cities, notably the Chinese capital Beijing and the populous city of Chengdu in southwest China, reversed declines to post growth

            <p>
                More broadly, prices in 100 cities monitored by the research firm fell 0.02 per cent from a month earlier in January compared with the bigger 0.08 per cent drop in December and marking the fourth straight month of narrowing declines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China's financial and commercial hub Shanghai saw a 0.04 per cent rise in home prices in January from a month earlier, extending the 0.01 per cent rise in December, while the mega-city of Hangzhou, capital of the prosperous coastal province of Zhejiang, reported a 0.11 per cent gain versus 0.06 per cent growth in the previous month

                "National property market policies will continue to ease, with some key first- and second-tier cities taking the lead in recovery and driving a gradual stabilisation of the national market," Cao said.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 1 — Several political analysts have weighed in on the “Malaysia Madani” concept launched by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim earlier last month, and whether it can be a useful guide for a new national narrative

                Amid concerns that it may fall by the wayside as so many previous government slogans, International Islamic University Malaysia’s (IIUM) political analyst Syaza Syukri said “Malaysia Madani” is a well-thought-out phrase that will influence the policy-making of the Anwar-led government

                THERE might not be any authentic Geordies in the Newcastle team once the Saudi money starts truly gushing into Tyneside.   So this was a night to cherish for the Toon Army, and for local hero Sean Longstaff, as his early double in front of the Gallowgate End propelled the club to its first Wembley final in 24 years.  The big midfielder, Newcastle born and bred, was serenaded with cries of "he’s one of our own" from a home crowd who thought they might be able to enjoy a significant win without much anxiety or tension

                Now, in the Carabao Cup Final, they will face Manchester United - barring a miracle from Nottingham Forest in the second leg at Old Trafford - seeking a first major trophy in 54 years and a first Wembley final success in 68 years

                Members of the Incident Management Team coordinate the search for a radioactive capsule that was lost in transit by a contractor hired by Rio Tinto, at the Emergency Services Complex in Cockburn, Australia, in this undated handout photo

            <p>
                The Caesium-137 capsule lost in transit more than two weeks ago was discovered when a vehicle travelling at 70 km per hour (43 mph) equipped with specialist detection equipment picked up the radiation, according to officials from the state of Western Australia

            <p>
                The search team then used portable detection equipment to find the capsule, which was located about 2 metres from the side of the road in a remote area far from any community, they added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The radioactive capsule was part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed from Rio Tinto's  Gudai-Darri mine in the state's remote Kimberley region

                Ryan Olohan said he was groped by Tiffany Miller at an upmarket Manhattan restaurant in December 2019, alleging that she told him she knew he liked Asian women, which she is, and that her marriage lacked “spice.” Miller, who is the director of Google’s programmatic media, allegedly complemented Olohan’s physique and touched his torso while they were at Fig & Olive during a company get-together, per a report by the New York Post

            <p>
                Olohan, 48, then took his concerns to human resources, which did not take any action

            <p>
                Miller did apologize, the lawsuit states, but “although Google was aware that Miller’s continued harassment of Olohan stemmed from his rejection of her sexual advances, it again took no action.” A further incident occurred in April 2022 during a company social event at a karaoke bar, when Miller once again verbally attacked Olohan while drunk, mocking him and reiterating that she knew he had a preference for Asian women with the prior knowledge that his wife is Asian

                Ryan Olohan said he was groped by Tiffany Miller at an upmarket Manhattan restaurant in December 2019, alleging that she told him she knew he liked Asian women, which she is, and that her marriage lacked “spice.” Miller, who is the director of Google’s programmatic media, allegedly complemented Olohan’s physique and touched his torso while they were at Fig & Olive during a company get-together, per a report by the New York Post

            <p>
                Olohan, 48, then took his concerns to human resources, which did not take any action

            <p>
                Miller did apologize, the lawsuit states, but “although Google was aware that Miller’s continued harassment of Olohan stemmed from his rejection of her sexual advances, it again took no action.” A further incident occurred in April 2022 during a company social event at a karaoke bar, when Miller once again verbally attacked Olohan while drunk, mocking him and reiterating that she knew he had a preference for Asian women with the prior knowledge that his wife is Asian

                As of November 2022, British American Tobacco (BTI) was the second-largest holding in Schiff’s portfolio

                Ambev is a cheap and stable dividend stock

            <p>
                That’s probably why it accounts for 2.8% of Peter Schiff’s portfolio

            <p>
                But it accounts for 2.23% of the company’s portfolio

                Yet Scotiabank is the 23rd largest position in Schiff’s portfolio

            <p>
                Schiff’s position could also be explained by Scotiabank’s valuation

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Brazilian has been at Old Trafford since 2018 but has had to deal with a more limited role this season due to Casemiro's and Eriksen's arrivals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is also possible that Eriksen's injury could trigger a wider tactical change
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag may wager that no individual player can bring quite what Eriksen excels at and switch formation entirely to a back three
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United have won 11 of the past 13 games with Ten Hag largely sticking to the same team where possible

                About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, Jan 31 — It is “shameful” of the “political bandits” who had recently tried to attempt a coup against Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor to now ask to be part of the new government, said Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) president Datuk Seri Maximus Ongkili
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili, whose PBS is part of the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) ruling coalition, described the three parties — Umno, Parti Warisan and Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Masyarakat (PKDM) — as “power-hungry political bandits” who had created the “disturbance” for their own political gain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Isn’t it a shameful political ploy that after failing to dislodge the chief minister and his government, you suddenly want to be invited to be part of the government?” he asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili, who was the former minister for Sabah and Sarawak affairs, said that he hoped the “cooling off period” called by Umno president and deputy prime minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is welcomed to strengthen political unity and solidarity in the state
            </p>

                Fahmi, who confirmed this on Tuesday (Jan 31), said that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had issued a directive at the Cabinet meeting two weeks ago that he (Fahmi) and the Communications and Digital Mnistry would act as the representative or spokesman for the government, especially when dealing with the media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fahmi said the media conference after the Cabinet meeting every Wednesday will be handled by him if the prime minister is unable to attend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Any week, for example, that the Prime Minister is unable to host the weekly media conference, the ministry and I will handle it,” he told the media after the the ministry's monthly gathering here Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fahmi said that as the government spokesman, the media can refer to him for confirmation of any issues that need to be verified

                stock market at the start of 2023 is likely to fizzle as the Federal Reserve prepares to defy investor hopes and lift interest rates for the eighth consecutive time, according to Morgan Stanley

                Michael Wilson, the chief U.S

            <p>
                equity strategist at Morgan Stanley and a longtime Wall Street bear, warned in an analyst note on Monday that despite recent market resilience, "reality is likely to return with month end and the Fed's resolve to tame inflation," "We think the recent price action is more a reflection of the seasonal January effect and short covering after a tough end to December and a brutal year," Wilson wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has previously suggested the S&P 500 could tumble to 3,000 points by year-end, down about 25% from current levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fed policymakers already voted to raise the benchmark interest rate seven straight times last year to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, well into restrictive territory

                stock market at the start of 2023 is likely to fizzle as the Federal Reserve prepares to defy investor hopes and lift interest rates for the eighth consecutive time, according to Morgan Stanley

            <p>
                equity strategist at Morgan Stanley and a longtime Wall Street bear, warned in an analyst note on Monday that despite recent market resilience, "reality is likely to return with month end and the Fed's resolve to tame inflation," "We think the recent price action is more a reflection of the seasonal January effect and short covering after a tough end to December and a brutal year," Wilson wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has previously suggested the S&P 500 could tumble to 3,000 points by year-end, down about 25% from current levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fed policymakers already voted to raise the benchmark interest rate seven straight times last year to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, well into restrictive territory

                "My only appeal is for them to settle this deal with Malaysia because 1MDB is known throughout the world.  "It is there in the books and I think that Goldman Sachs should come out clean and deal with Malaysia,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was previously reported that Goldman claimed that Malaysia had "undervalued" the assets already retrieved, as part of its recovery from the scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under a settlement announced in October 2020, Goldman was to pay US$2.5 billion (RM10.7 billion) while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4 billion of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the world.  According to Bloomberg, the settlement was in exchange for Malaysia to drop charges against Goldman Sachs.  The bank was also to make a one-time interim payment of US$250 million if Malaysia has not received at least US$500 million in assets and proceeds by August 2022.  However, Bloomberg reported that Goldman, in its filing to the United States' Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), had accused Malaysia of having “unilaterally reduced” the value of one asset by US$80 million.  Malaysia was also reportedly declined to include substantial additional assets in accounting of assets and proceeds recovered.  In the Bloomberg interview, Mr Anwar said that Malaysia is supposed to be paid much more than the amount stated in the settlement.  “Given a fair deal, we are supposed to be paid much more than that, which I intend to deal with them, if these things are not settled amicably,” he said in response to Goldman’s claims.  “It’s not my intention – I’m just new in the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How much we can get, I frankly can't say for now, but it's much more than we should be able to do," he said, adding that governments around the world should act more "responsibly" to assist the asset recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to The Star, the Malaysian government in 2018 turned its attention to Goldman Sachs for raising US$6.5 billion in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB.  A huge chunk of the funds - earmarked for development - was, however, diverted to pay bribes to government officials, according to US federal prosecutors.  In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion and the bank also agreed for its Malaysia subsidiary to plead guilty in a US federal court.  Under terms of the deal, Goldman agreed to pay a US$2.3 billion fine for breaking anti-bribery laws and to pay back US$600 million of ill-gotten gains as part of a deferred prosecution agreement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal also requires Goldman to improve its compliance controls.

                Under a settlement announced in October 2020, Goldman was to pay US$2.5 billion (RM10.7 billion) while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4 billion of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the world.  According to Bloomberg, the settlement was in exchange for Malaysia to drop charges against Goldman Sachs.  The bank was also to make a one-time interim payment of US$250 million if Malaysia has not received at least US$500 million in assets and proceeds by August 2022.  However, Bloomberg reported that Goldman, in its filing to the United States' Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), had accused Malaysia of having “unilaterally reduced” the value of one asset by US$80 million.  Malaysia was also reportedly declined to include substantial additional assets in accounting of assets and proceeds recovered.  In the Bloomberg interview, Mr Anwar said that Malaysia is supposed to be paid much more than the amount stated in the settlement.  “Given a fair deal, we are supposed to be paid much more than that, which I intend to deal with them, if these things are not settled amicably,” he said in response to Goldman’s claims.  “It’s not my intention – I’m just new in the game

            <p>
                "How much we can get, I frankly can't say for now, but it's much more than we should be able to do," he said, adding that governments around the world should act more "responsibly" to assist the asset recovery

                According to The Star, the Malaysian government in 2018 turned its attention to Goldman Sachs for raising US$6.5 billion in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB.  A huge chunk of the funds - earmarked for development - was, however, diverted to pay bribes to government officials, according to US federal prosecutors.  In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion and the bank also agreed for its Malaysia subsidiary to plead guilty in a US federal court.  Under terms of the deal, Goldman agreed to pay a US$2.3 billion fine for breaking anti-bribery laws and to pay back US$600 million of ill-gotten gains as part of a deferred prosecution agreement

            <p>
                The deal also requires Goldman to improve its compliance controls.

                These were among the common words that trickled from their lips in their remembrance of Sri Ram
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sithambaram, a senior lawyer who led the prosecution in Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s SRC International Sdn Bhd case, spoke of Sri Ram’s kindness and willingness to share his legal knowledge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                People are quite jealous about sharing but he loves to share and likes everyone to be a good lawyer.”Sithambaram also said Sri Ram worked very hard, right to the end.“I think it’s his calling to be a lawyer and a judge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Damansara MP Gobind Singh Deo, who is also a lawyer and former minister, described Sri Ram as a “brilliant” lawyer and judge who contributed immensely to the legal profession and who was always of great help to lawyers who need any advice or guidance.“He’s always been very, very helpful, when it came to guidance, when I had questions of law, he would help, he was always very quick to respond and to provide me with the guidance that a younger lawyer would need
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He lives and breathes the law,” said Sivananthan, who has known Sri Ram for 25 years since his days as a Court of Appeal judge.“As a legal eagle he’s one of a kind

                MOISES CAICEDO Coveted by several elite clubs, the 21-year-old had hoped his time to leave Brighton for Champions League football had arrived
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arguably one of the top central midfielders in the Premier League on the evidence of this season, it's no belittlement to Brighton that Caicedo will outgrow them at some point, but that time was not now

                BARCELONA Despite being linked with some big names in European football, the Catalans ended up empty-handed in the January transfer window (at least for the time being, with a €4m move for LA Galaxy right-back Julian Araujo still pending)

                People and rescue workers gather to look for survivors under a collapsed roof, after a suicide blast in a mosque in Peshawar, Pakistan January 30, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The attack, in the Police Lines district, was the deadliest in a decade to hit this restive, northwestern city near the Afghan border and comes amid a surge in violence against the police
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah told parliament that 97 of the 100 were police officials
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Authorities say they do not know how the bomber managed to breach the military and police checkpoints leading into the Police Lines district, a colonial-era, self-contained encampment in the city centre that is home to middle- and lower-ranking police personnel and their families

            <p>
                The attack is the deadliest in Peshawar since twin suicide bombings at All Saints Church killed scores of worshippers in September 2013, in what is the deadliest attack on Pakistan's Christian minority

                He was responding to claims by Goldman that Malaysia had "undervalued" the assets already retrieved, as part of its recovery from the scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Anwar, the 1MDB scandal is a "crime" committed not only against him, or the Malaysian government, but against all "Malaysians." He urged Goldman to "come clean" and settle the deal with Malaysia as 1MDB was a scandal known throughout the world, and not just dismiss it by flexing the firm's financial muscle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goldman raised US$6.5 billion (RM27.6 billion) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion (RM12.3 billion) and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge, to settle probes into the looting of billions of dollars from 1MDB and payment of bribes to win business for the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To a claim by Goldman that Malaysia was intentionally undervaluing the assets to force Goldman to pay a US$250 million interim payment, Anwar said that under a "fair deal", Malaysia was supposed to have been paid much more than that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How much we can get, I frankly can't say for now, but it's much more than we should be able to do (sic)," he said, urging governments around the world to act more "responsibly" to assist the asset recovery.

                Rob Dawson explains why Manchester City are open to letting star defender Joao Cancelo leave the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ESPN reported on Monday that Cancelo was keen to leave Premier League champions City after growing frustrated with his lack of playing time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'll give my best for FC Bayern." Sources told ESPN that City are unlikely to try to replace Cancelo, with Guardiola feeling he has enough cover at full-back and centre-back to cope without him during the second half of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                City remain in the hunt for trophies in the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cancelo arrived at the Etihad Stadium from Juventus in 2019 and was key to Premier League title wins in 2021 and 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We're very happy that Joao Cancelo will now play for FC Bayern," Bayern board member Hasan Salihamidzic said

                Rob Dawson explains why Manchester City are open to letting star defender Joao Cancelo leave the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ESPN reported on Monday that Cancelo was keen to leave Premier League champions City after growing frustrated with his lack of playing time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'll give my best for FC Bayern." Sources told ESPN that City are unlikely to try to replace Cancelo, with Guardiola feeling he has enough cover at full-back and centre-back to cope without him during the second half of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                City remain in the hunt for trophies in the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cancelo arrived at the Etihad Stadium from Juventus in 2019 and was key to Premier League title wins in 2021 and 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We're very happy that Joao Cancelo will now play for FC Bayern," Bayern board member Hasan Salihamidzic said

                Speaking at the 2021 National Sports Awards ceremony here on Tuesday (Jan 31), Anwar related his discussion with Alex Ferguson during a meeting that was made possible by former United States vice president Al Gore in New York some time ago

            <p>
                Anwar added that Ferguson's concern in safeguarding the values and welfare of the players should be exemplary and should be replicated by managers and administrators of sports in Malaysia so as to build strong values among athletes

                Malaysia had raised the debt limit to 60% of gross domestic product from 55% in 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, and lifted it further to 65% in 2021 to make room for additional borrowings to fund fiscal stimulus

                Malaysia’s actual debt is at 61% of GDP, and the law under which the ceiling was raised lapsed on Dec 31

                While Malaysia remains A-rated by credit agencies Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, a reduction in government debt ratio will be key to winning a higher credit score from Fitch Ratings Ltd, which is currently the only one of the three main rating companies to have a lower BBB+ rating on the South-East Asian nation

                Anwar, who doubles as Finance Minister, is set to table the revised 2023 Budget to Parliament on Feb 24 and has been preaching fiscal prudence as the South-East Asian nation stares down still-elevated debt levels in the wake of a Covid-era spending drive

                While he acknowledged that the goods and services tax remains the most transparent and efficient taxation system, he said his government isn’t in a hurry to reinstate the tax that was abolished in 2018

                Earlier this month, Anwar had warned that this year’s fiscal position won’t be comfortable, with about RM1.5 trillion in total debt and liabilities and a budget deficit setting around 5.8% of gross domestic product as of last year

            <p>
                Deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib this morning informed the High Court that although today was scheduled for the continued hearing of Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s 1MDB trial, they were asking for a postponement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah then allowed the prosecution’s request and said the trial will resume this Thursday morning with the continued cross-examination of 41st prosecution witness and former AmBank relationship manager Joanna Yu

            <p>
                Yesterday afternoon, Sri Ram — who was the lead prosecutor for the 1MDB trial — died at the age of 79 in a private hospital in Kuala Lumpur, following a lung infection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from the 1MDB trial, Sri Ram was also the lead prosecutor for Najib’s trial over the alleged tampering of the auditor-general’s 2016 report on 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram was also the lead prosecutor for Rosmah’s trial over the soliciting and receiving of millions of ringgit in bribes in exchange for helping to secure a RM1.25 billion contract, and her separate money-laundering trial — which has yet to start — involving over RM7 million.

                Idrus was responding to speculations that a private law firm will be replacing former Federal Court judge and lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram, who passed away on Sunday (Jan 29)

            <p>
                Previously, Sri Ram had worked together with DPPs from the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) in two 1MDB-related trials and Rosmah’s appeal on her corruption conviction

                He was appointed as lead prosecutor by then the attorney general Tan Sri Tommy Thomas in 2018

            <p>
                Sri Ram was also lead prosecutor in another 1MDB audit tampering trial involving Najib and former 1MDB CEO Arul Kanda Kandasamy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosmah was appealing to disqualify High Court judge Justice Mohamed Zaini Mazlan as the trial judge and to set aside her conviction and sentence

                Idrus was responding to speculations that a private law firm will be replacing former Federal Court judge and lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram, who passed away on Sunday (Jan 29)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Sri Ram had worked together with DPPs from the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) in two 1MDB-related trials and Rosmah’s appeal on her corruption conviction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was appointed as lead prosecutor by then the attorney general Tan Sri Tommy Thomas in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram was also lead prosecutor in another 1MDB audit tampering trial involving Najib and former 1MDB CEO Arul Kanda Kandasamy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosmah was appealing to disqualify High Court judge Justice Mohamed Zaini Mazlan as the trial judge and to set aside her conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                Deputy Public Prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib asked High Court judge Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah for the proceedings to be adjourned on Monday and Tuesday (Jan 31) in light of Sri Ram's sudden demise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Monday was set for a continued hearing where prosecution witness Joanna Yu, who was Datuk Seri Najib Razak's former relationship manager at AmBank, was supposed to take the stand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told the court that the defence has no objection to the adjournment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee also extended his condolences to the prosecution team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Sequerah then allowed the adjournment

            <p>
                Also earlier today, former Umno Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin who was among those sacked from the party, said that he will not be appealing the decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Khairy said he had discussed the matter with former supreme council member Tan Sri Noh Omar and former Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan who were also part of those purged from the party
            </p>

                Additionally, former vice-president Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein and former information chief Shahril Sufian Hamdan were suspended for six years, along with Datuk Maulizan Bujang and Datuk Seri Mohd Salim Sharif.

                This morning, Bernama reported Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as saying that his coalition Pakatan Harapan (PH) will take the views of component party leaders into consideration before deciding to accept expelled Umno leaders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also earlier today, former Umno Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin who was among those sacked from the party, said that he will not be appealing the decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Khairy said he had discussed the matter with former supreme council member Tan Sri Noh Omar and former Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan who were also part of those purged from the party
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I discussed the matter with Noh and Shahril
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, former vice-president Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein and former information chief Shahril Sufian Hamdan were suspended for six years, along with Datuk Maulizan Bujang and Datuk Seri Mohd Salim Sharif.

                ChatGPT has taken the world by storm

            <p>
                Elad Gil, a widely respected Silicon Valley angel investor—he made early bets on Airbnb, Instacart, and Square—believes “the fact that ChatGPT is down all the time right now is a great sign of product-market fit

                It’s really hard to know.” Meanwhile, when an idea works, it tends to work very quickly, something he’s seen repeatedly with companies he’s worked at and invested in over the years—and now sees with OpenAI and ChatGPT

Gordon will not be able to make his Newcastle debut in Tuesday's Carabao Cup semifinal second-leg against Southampton -- Newcastle lead 1-0 from the first-leg -- after becoming cup tied while playing in Everton's third round defeat against Bournemouth in November

            <p>
                "I'm really excited to work with him, to develop him, and I'm looking forward to seeing what he can do in a Newcastle shirt." ESPN reported earlier this week that Gordon failed to report for training at Everton amid interest from Newcastle, who are chasing a top-four finish in the Premier League and Champions League qualification

                In a statement, YTL said it is the first time electricity from Malaysia would be supplied to Singapore on a commercial basis, adhering to the Malaysian Energy Commission’s guide for cross-border electricity sales (CBES Guide)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                YTL PowerSeraya was awarded the electricity importer licence for Malaysia for a two-year trial by the Energy Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) after a competitive request for proposal process in October 2021, and will purchase the electricity from TNB Pasir Gudang Energy Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned special vehicle company by TNB Genco
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both parties will work closely with the EMA and the Energy Commission to refine all technical settings and regulatory arrangements under the Electricity Import Framework and the agreement will be effective upon fulfilment of the conditions precedent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “YTL PowerSeraya, together with YTL Power International, is honoured to work with TNB Genco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TNB, the national electricity utility in Malaysia, to contribute our part in diversifying Singapore’s energy sources and further enhancing the nation’s energy security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We believe that this is the first step in our vision of a strong Asean power grid, where electricity imports may eventually form a key part of Singapore’s energy mix,” YTL PowerSeraya chief executive officer John Ng said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will mark TNB Genco’s maiden foray into the Singapore market via CBES and we hope this will become the catalyst to capture future projects in this market.”

                In a statement, YTL said it is the first time electricity from Malaysia would be supplied to Singapore on a commercial basis, adhering to the Malaysian Energy Commission’s guide for cross-border electricity sales (CBES Guide)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                YTL PowerSeraya was awarded the electricity importer licence for Malaysia for a two-year trial by the Energy Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) after a competitive request for proposal process in October 2021, and will purchase the electricity from TNB Pasir Gudang Energy Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned special vehicle company by TNB Genco
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both parties will work closely with the EMA and the Energy Commission to refine all technical settings and regulatory arrangements under the Electricity Import Framework and the agreement will be effective upon fulfilment of the conditions precedent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “YTL PowerSeraya, together with YTL Power International, is honoured to work with TNB Genco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TNB, the national electricity utility in Malaysia, to contribute our part in diversifying Singapore’s energy sources and further enhancing the nation’s energy security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We believe that this is the first step in our vision of a strong Asean power grid, where electricity imports may eventually form a key part of Singapore’s energy mix,” YTL PowerSeraya chief executive officer John Ng said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will mark TNB Genco’s maiden foray into the Singapore market via CBES and we hope this will become the catalyst to capture future projects in this market.”

                Singapore-based Sea will also open a cloud computing project in the Johor town of Kulai
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Aziz at the Shopee headquarters in Singapore on Jan 29, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shopee is the largest pan-regional e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan.  Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tengku Zafrul Aziz announced this move during his official visit to the company’s headquarters in Singapore on Sunday (Jan 29).  Sea's decision to expand its investment footprint in Malaysia reflects the company’s confidence in the prospects, as well as the operational and policy stability of the country’s business landscape, he added.  During the minister's visit, Sea shared its proposed expansion plans in Malaysia, involving the setting up of cloud computing services, data hosting and processing, as well as a new logistics e-commerce warehouse.  The cloud computing project will be located in a three-storey green facility in the Johor town of Kulai, said Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This includes local sourcing, vendor development and the strengthening of the local industrial ecosystem, particularly in the digital space," said Tengku Zafrul.  Tengku Zafrul's three-day investment mission to Singapore is in conjunction with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s first official visit to the country on Monday.  During the visit, he will also have one-on-one business meetings with the Yondr Group, a global leader in data centres and INSEACT, a Singapore-based alternative protein company which specialises in producing sustainable insect protein for aquaculture.  Sea's co-founder and group chief operating officer, Gang Ye said the decision was a significant development not just for the group, but also for the local digital ecosystem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sea has also laid off more than 7,000 employees - or about 10 per cent of its workforce - as of December last year.  Staff cuts were also made at Garena in September 2022, including the shutting down some major projects to boost Sea's profitability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That same month, more Shopee employees were also laid off, with some of them having their job offers rescinded days before they began work.

                Azalina said the court found such conduct by the alleged Sulu heirs to amount to a "manifestly illicit hardship" that is detrimental to Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak in 2010 declared Stampa as having no jurisdiction over Malaysia and ordered a stop to the continued arbitrations in Spain, Stampa and the Sulu claimants ignored a Spanish court's decision to cancel his appointment and shifted the entire arbitration to France

            <p>
                Ignoring the Spanish and French courts' decisions which meant the arbitration was illegitimate, Stampa on February 28, 2022, gave his arbitration decision — also known as the "final award" — to order Malaysia to pay US$14.92 billion to the eight Sulu claimants

                After the seizure order issued in July 2022, Azalina said Malaysia had immediately applied to the District Court of Luxembourg to obtain an interim relief to release or set aside the seizure order known as "saisie arrêt"

                Mohd Nazifuddin, who is also a member of the Langkawi Umno Youth, said he wished to help the youth wing attract more youngsters to strengthen the party in the future

                He also said that as a member of a sports association, it would be his leverage to approach the young and bring them to the party’s fold

            <p>
                Mohd Nazifuddin, the secretary-general of the Malaysian Olympic Council, said he realised that one of Umno’s main challenges was in attracting the young to join the party, but that he was up to the task

            <p>
                "I humbly ask for support from all of my Umno Youth peers nationwide," he said

            <p>
                Umno will hold its party polls to appoint its new office bearers from Feb 1 to March 18.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 29 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will undertake his first official visit to Singapore tomorrow (Jan 30) at the invitation of his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong

            <p>
                The Malaysian Foreign Ministry (Wisma Putra), in a statement, said Anwar – in his maiden visit to the republic after being sworn in as the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia – will be meeting President Halimah Yacob and Lee
            </p>

                "Prime Minister will also hold an engagement with the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore," said the statement

            <p>
                The statement said the visit reflects the importance of the Malaysia-Singapore ties as close neighbours and partners in Asean
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar will be accompanied by his wife, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, and the delegation will comprise foreign affairs minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, Minister of Transport Anthony Loke Siew Fook, Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, Minister of Communications and Digital Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil, and officials from the relevant ministries and agencies

                Mohamed Salah has struggled to produce his best form for Liverpool this season It's not just Saturday, since the World Cup or even this season that Salah has looked a little off form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This time Salah did take a spot-kick - but crucially he missed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The end result right now though is Salah's source for chances is not delivering the goods like it once did
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Granted, he isn't quite man-marked out of game given his modest goals record this season but Liverpool's often relatively ponderous attacking build up is detrimental to Salah's game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp's tactics this term have forced Salah out to the right and have limited the forward Salah's drop in form could also come from a factor that no footballer can beat..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah's run of four league games without goal contributions is his worst run for two years That's not to say Salah is finished - far from it

                Mohamed Salah has struggled to produce his best form for Liverpool this season It's not just Saturday, since the World Cup or even this season that Salah has looked a little off form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This time Salah did take a spot-kick - but crucially he missed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The end result right now though is Salah's source for chances is not delivering the goods like it once did
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Granted, he isn't quite man-marked out of game given his modest goals record this season but Liverpool's often relatively ponderous attacking build up is detrimental to Salah's game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp's tactics this term have forced Salah out to the right and have limited the forward Salah's drop in form could also come from a factor that no footballer can beat..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah's run of four league games without goal contributions is his worst run for two years That's not to say Salah is finished - far from it
            </p>

                Liverpool takes on Brighton in the FA Cup later

            <p>
                But Liverpool has kept back-to-back clean sheets since then, with Stefan Bajčetić enjoying something of an emergence

                Matt Addison - Stefan Bajčetić stays in Liverpool might as well go strong here because they have a full week before facing Wolves

            <p>
                For me, that means bringing Joël Matip back into the side, and one of Fabinho or Jordan Henderson — you can't really take Bajčetić out after what he did against Chelsea, but Naby Keïta didn't do much on his first start of the season
            </p>

                Matt Addison - Stefan Bajčetić stays in Liverpool might as well go strong here because they have a full week before facing Wolves

                For me, that means bringing Joël Matip back into the side, and one of Fabinho or Jordan Henderson — you can't really take Bajčetić out after what he did against Chelsea, but Naby Keïta didn't do much on his first start of the season

                Then, some of the ones who stayed on the job quietly started doing the minimum work required.And more recently have come mass layoffs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The pandemic may have motivated people to re-evaluate their life priorities and also gotten them accustomed to more flexible work arrangements (e.g., work from home), leading them to choose to work fewer hours, especially if they can afford it,” the report said

            <p>
                The desire for work-life balance may play out as quiet quitting, in which workers merely coast on the job rather than putting in much effort, according to the report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the height of the pandemic, many people who were ill had to take significant time off and therefore reduced their hours, but the work-less trend continued last year when COVID had less of an impact.The changes in work hours happened against a backdrop of a strong labor market, with unemployment in December at a mere 3.5%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before the pandemic, the share of men in the workforce had also been on the decline

                is a very exceptional country where people value work so much, and they really idolize hard work, so that they work so many hours compared to other European countries,” Shin told Fortune earlier this month.“We don’t know the future, but it seems like this is something that may actually stick around,” he said about the decline in working hours

                Then, some of the ones who stayed on the job quietly started doing the minimum work required.And more recently have come mass layoffs

            <p>
                "The pandemic may have motivated people to re-evaluate their life priorities and also gotten them accustomed to more flexible work arrangements (e.g., work from home), leading them to choose to work fewer hours, especially if they can afford it,” the report said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The desire for work-life balance may play out as quiet quitting, in which workers merely coast on the job rather than putting in much effort, according to the report

            <p>
                During the height of the pandemic, many people who were ill had to take significant time off and therefore reduced their hours, but the work-less trend continued last year when COVID had less of an impact.The changes in work hours happened against a backdrop of a strong labor market, with unemployment in December at a mere 3.5%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before the pandemic, the share of men in the workforce had also been on the decline

                is a very exceptional country where people value work so much, and they really idolize hard work, so that they work so many hours compared to other European countries,” Shin told Fortune earlier this month.“We don’t know the future, but it seems like this is something that may actually stick around,” he said about the decline in working hours

                The Local Government Development Minister said the same people, when in power, had gone to Singapore to do the same, but failed to learn anything
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nga said government-to-government initiatives have been in place since the 1970s, not only with Singapore but other Asean countries such as Thailand and Indonesia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said what is important is that the ministry wants the best for the country and the people, and it does not matter where the advice comes from
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nga said that is the ministry’s only objective, adding that Singapore’s Housing Development Board has been recognised as one of the best in the world, and thus there is no harm learning from the city-state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Let me emphasise this – if a country fails to learn, then the country will not progress, and to develop we must continue lifelong learning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is our 41st anniversary of the Look East Policy, and if we can learn from Japan, what’s wrong if we do likewise with our neighbour Singapore?” he added

                The Local Government Development Minister said the same people, when in power, had gone to Singapore to do the same, but failed to learn anything
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nga said government-to-government initiatives have been in place since the 1970s, not only with Singapore but other Asean countries such as Thailand and Indonesia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said what is important is that the ministry wants the best for the country and the people, and it does not matter where the advice comes from
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nga said that is the ministry’s only objective, adding that Singapore’s Housing Development Board has been recognised as one of the best in the world, and thus there is no harm learning from the city-state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Let me emphasise this – if a country fails to learn, then the country will not progress, and to develop we must continue lifelong learning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is our 41st anniversary of the Look East Policy, and if we can learn from Japan, what’s wrong if we do likewise with our neighbour Singapore?” he added

                First, there was the “great resignation.” And now there's quiet quitting

                According to an August ResumeBuilder.com survey of 1,000 working Americans, 21% of respondents say they only do the bare minimum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another 5% say they do even less than what they’re paid to do

            <p>
                And even if they’re not doing the bare minimum, people are definitely pulling back

            <p>
                One-third of the survey’s respondents say they’ve reduced their weekly work hours by more than 50%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                About 34% of respondents in the Offsyte survey said they want to take on more responsibilities at their current employer and 31% said they want to learn new skill sets in 2023

            <p>
                Yii had earlier raised questions about the project and its cost

            <p>
                Yii, who is also DAP Youth national chief, said the state government should reveal the identity of the private entity making the CSR contribution and any past or imminent dealings with the state government

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 29 — Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor said he now leads Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah, also known as Gagasan Rakyat, to end his “party-less” status and strengthen his standing as the Sabah chief minister

            <p>
                Hasni, who refused to divulge his next course of action, said as a person who wanted the party to be dominant in Johor, he would not just be sitting around and doing nothing after his removal as state Umno chairman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasni, who has headed the state committee since 2018, said that he took over the helm when Umno was in the opposition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I hope our new chairman Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin will be able to call for a meeting soon to discuss the latest developments in the party," he said, adding that he was still an Umno supreme council member
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasni reminded his party leadership that whatever decision made in Umno should not be at the expense of giving an edge to other parties who were already wooing some of the leaders who were sacked or suspended

                Meor Azuan Hassan celebrates Shello Silverius' goal during their game against Japan at the Birsa Munda Stadium in Rourkela
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wily midfielder Shello Silverius was the toast with two goals in the seventh and 31st minute to end his World Cup campaign with three goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan's goals were scored by Kaito Tanaka (23rd minute) and Seren Tanaka (31st)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means Malaysia will end their World Cup in 13th, an improvement compared to their 2018 outing, where they were booted out of the group stages and finished 15th.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 28 — The real threat to the survival of the ethnic Malay community and Malaysia as a whole is corruption as well as leaders who steal the country’s wealth, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar was countering politicians who harp on race and religion, saying these are irrelevant to good governance

                The Malay survival is being threatened by a corrupt system, a greedy coterie of leaders who have been stealing public funds from this country, so we will have to continue to work together to make sure we save this country from corruption,” he said in his keynote speech at the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia's (ACCCIM) Chinese New Year open house here

            <p>
                Comm Idris said this was because the probe was still in the early stages and any further statement could jeopardise the probe

            <p>
                In the same report, Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Acryl Sani Abdullah Sani confirmed the matter but said the Sabah police chief would issue a statement later.

                According to Dr Yii, the best way to honour the return of Sarawak’s rights under MA63 is to ensure that such rights translate into direct benefit for the people of Sarawak
            </p>

                “But with ‘great power, comes great responsibility’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additional autonomy or even allocations should be vetted and scrutinised with utmost diligence and the Sarawak Government has the onus and greater responsibility to ensure its being spent prudently, without wastage, and more importantly benefiting the people of Sarawak,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Yii stressed that there are greater needs that can be invested in Sarawak especially when it comes to healthcare and even in education

            <p>
                Yesterday, a source told The Borneo Post that the Sarawak government was planning to erect the country’s highest flagpole to fly the Sarawak flag in Petra Jaya
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The source said the proposed flagpole would be 99 metres tall, four metres higher than the country’s current tallest flagpole at Merdeka Square in Kuala Lumpur

                According to Dr Yii, the best way to honour the return of Sarawak’s rights under MA63 is to ensure that such rights translate into direct benefit for the people of Sarawak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But with ‘great power, comes great responsibility’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additional autonomy or even allocations should be vetted and scrutinised with utmost diligence and the Sarawak Government has the onus and greater responsibility to ensure its being spent prudently, without wastage, and more importantly benefiting the people of Sarawak,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Yii stressed that there are greater needs that can be invested in Sarawak especially when it comes to healthcare and even in education

                Yesterday, a source told The Borneo Post that the Sarawak government was planning to erect the country’s highest flagpole to fly the Sarawak flag in Petra Jaya
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The source said the proposed flagpole would be 99 metres tall, four metres higher than the country’s current tallest flagpole at Merdeka Square in Kuala Lumpur

            <p>
                The states of Johor, Pahang and Sabah have been hit by flooding amid continuous heavy rain brought about by the northeast monsoon.  Nearly 14,000 people in the three states were in temporary flood relief centres, Bernama reported on Saturday morning, but that number fell significantly by evening.  “I don’t think a flood emergency should be declared because it only involves certain states and districts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The state disaster management committees have taken proactive measures together with the district disaster management committees,” said Ahmad Zahid, who is also the chairman of the Central Disaster Management Committee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The aid provided has been given to all the heads of families and, at the same time, we have other matters that need to be carried out, including post-flood assistance,” he told a media conference after visiting a temporary relief centre in Mersing.  Ahmad Zahid, who is also the rural and regional development minister, added that the government will look into improving coordination among non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the relevant agencies involved in post-flood management
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked to comment on political developments a day after his party UMNO expelled former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin and suspended former defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein, Ahmad Zahid, who is party president, said he would only address flood-related questions.  “This is a press conference on flood matters only," he said, as quoted by the Star.  UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), Malaysia’s oldest political party, expelled Khairy and supreme council member Noh Omar on Friday for breaching party disciplinary rules during the country’s recent general election

            <p>
                The states of Johor, Pahang and Sabah have been hit by flooding amid continuous heavy rain brought about by the northeast monsoon.  Nearly 14,000 people in the three states were in temporary flood relief centres, Bernama reported on Saturday morning, but that number fell significantly by evening.  “I don’t think a flood emergency should be declared because it only involves certain states and districts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The state disaster management committees have taken proactive measures together with the district disaster management committees,” said Ahmad Zahid, who is also the chairman of the Central Disaster Management Committee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The aid provided has been given to all the heads of families and, at the same time, we have other matters that need to be carried out, including post-flood assistance,” he told a media conference after visiting a temporary relief centre in Mersing.  Ahmad Zahid, who is also the rural and regional development minister, added that the government will look into improving coordination among non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the relevant agencies involved in post-flood management
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked to comment on political developments a day after his party UMNO expelled former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin and suspended former defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein, Ahmad Zahid, who is party president, said he would only address flood-related questions.  “This is a press conference on flood matters only," he said, as quoted by the Star.  UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), Malaysia’s oldest political party, expelled Khairy and supreme council member Noh Omar on Friday for breaching party disciplinary rules during the country’s recent general election

                Brighton is missing two key players going into the FA Cup fourth round against Liverpool, as coach Roberto De Zerbi has discussed Liverpool target Moisés Caicedo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The last time Liverpool ventured south, they were on the receiving end of a hiding from Roberto De Zerbi’s men
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool was demolished 3-0, and Jürgen Klopp will be hoping that score line doesn’t happen again any time soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Brighton’s task has been much that little bit harder with the news that former Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana and defender Levi Colwill are both set to miss the game through injury
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And De Zerbi has been speaking about Caicedo, who has been a Liverpool transfer target, has been speaking to the media in the build-up to the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I spoke with Moisés and told him it's difficult to change during the season

                Brighton is missing two key players going into the FA Cup fourth round against Liverpool, as coach Roberto De Zerbi has discussed Liverpool target Moisés Caicedo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The last time Liverpool ventured south, they were on the receiving end of a hiding from Roberto De Zerbi’s men
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool was demolished 3-0, and Jürgen Klopp will be hoping that score line doesn’t happen again any time soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Brighton’s task has been much that little bit harder with the news that former Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana and defender Levi Colwill are both set to miss the game through injury
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And De Zerbi has been speaking about Caicedo, who has been a Liverpool transfer target, has been speaking to the media in the build-up to the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I spoke with Moisés and told him it's difficult to change during the season
            </p>

                Arteta will now hope Bukayo Saka will follow in Martinelli's footsteps and pen a new deal with the England winger out of contract in 2024 - although the Gunners can extend this by a year.  Despite Martinelli reportedly penning a new deal, the Brazilian was rested for Arsenal's FA Cup fourth round tie with Manchester City on Friday night - with Arteta opting for new signing Leandro Trossard

                Former FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces fraud charges over the collapse of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, leaves on the day of a hearing at Manhattan federal court in New York City, US on Jan 3, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried, 30, has been free on a US$250 million bond since pleading not guilty to charges of fraud in the looting of billions of dollars from the now-bankrupt FTX
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prosecutors said their request was in response to Bankman-Fried's recent effort to contact a potential witness against him, the general counsel of an FTX affiliate, and was needed to prevent witness tampering and other obstruction of justice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They said a Signal ban isn't necessary because Bankman-Fried is not using the auto-delete feature, and the concern that he might is "unfounded"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyers also asked to remove a bail condition preventing Bankman-Fried from accessing FTX, Alameda or cryptocurrency assets, saying there was "no evidence" he was responsible for earlier alleged unauthorised transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an order on Saturday, Kaplan gave prosecutors until Monday to address Bankman-Fried's concerns

                Besides fiscal consolidation, Rafizi said, another challenge for the country is to broaden its revenue base

                Besides fiscal consolidation, Rafizi said, another challenge for the country is to broaden its revenue base

            <p>
                The third challenge, Rafizi said, is restructuring the economy, which means moving from a low wage-based, manufacturing-driven economy to one that is service-based with high tech and value content
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is more about our ability to provide the right skilled workforce, because we are no longer a low-value, low-wage manufacturing base

                Noh, who is still Tanjong Karang Umno chief, is expected to be subjected to disciplinary action with five other unnamed leaders from his division, Utusan Malaysia reported today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the source, Umno needs to take such disciplinary action to protect the party’s good name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is not difficult to figure out which Umno member will be subjected to disciplinary action,” the anonymous source was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noh, who is also an Umno supreme council member, resigned as Selangor Umno chief last November after saying that he no longer had confidence in party president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other than Noh, speculation has been rife that Umno will take disciplinary action against its former Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno’s supreme council meeting tonight will be closely watched as it is understood that disciplinary action will be taken against several party leaders.

                Noh, who is still Tanjong Karang Umno chief, is expected to be subjected to disciplinary action with five other unnamed leaders from his division, Utusan Malaysia reported today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the source, Umno needs to take such disciplinary action to protect the party’s good name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is not difficult to figure out which Umno member will be subjected to disciplinary action,” the anonymous source was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noh, who is also an Umno supreme council member, resigned as Selangor Umno chief last November after saying that he no longer had confidence in party president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other than Noh, speculation has been rife that Umno will take disciplinary action against its former Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno’s supreme council meeting tonight will be closely watched as it is understood that disciplinary action will be taken against several party leaders.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 27 — Some government hospitals might see their contract pharmacists walk out on the job in protest of a required interview as part of the procedure for permanent positions

                On January 18, 2023, BMW of North America announced a safety recall for all 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP motorcycles due to the potential risk of a broken gearbox input shaft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This could, in turn, block the rear wheel, which could increase the risk of a crash.  According to BMW, approximately 18,489 motorcycles are involved in this recall, which represents 100 percent of the population
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BMW intensified its analysis of the issue, and eventually determined that if there is an abrupt difference between the engine speed and the rotational speed of the final drive component, the gearbox input shaft could become overloaded, and break as a result
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s why BMW decided to issue this recall.  Owners will be notified via postal mail that they should stop riding their affected bikes and contact their local authorized BMW dealer for recall service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BMW has also issued a Stop Sale notice to its dealers for all affected 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP bikes until recall service has been performed.  BMW North America notified its dealer network about this recall on January 18, 2023

                Declan Rice is reportedly Arsenal's top transfer target for the summer window, but some supporters have a brilliant theory regarding a move before the end of this month Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters Signing a midfielder would be the ideal scenario for Arsenal before the January transfer window closes on Tuesday night, Mikel Arteta has revealed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Well, we need some more cover in midfield ideally if we can," the Spaniard toldfootball.london
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, it was public knowledge that Arsenal were interested in Raphinha and Lisandro Martinez during last summer's transfer window and then Mykhailo Mudryk this month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence a change of approach from Arteta and sporting director Edu Gaspar? Well, when it comes to stunning transfer theories, not many are better at it than Arsenal supporters and a brand new one has been created that involves Declan Rice with a midfield signing the priority between now and Tuesday night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Caicedo talk has to be a smokescreen"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, these Arsenal fans are unlikely to be proven right - well at least this month at least - as whilst Rice is reportedly a target for the Premier League leaders, it's said that any potential deal will happen at the end of the season with West Ham United understandably reluctant to sell before Tuesday

                Declan Rice is reportedly Arsenal's top transfer target for the summer window, but some supporters have a brilliant theory regarding a move before the end of this month Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters Signing a midfielder would be the ideal scenario for Arsenal before the January transfer window closes on Tuesday night, Mikel Arteta has revealed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Well, we need some more cover in midfield ideally if we can," the Spaniard toldfootball.london
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, it was public knowledge that Arsenal were interested in Raphinha and Lisandro Martinez during last summer's transfer window and then Mykhailo Mudryk this month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence a change of approach from Arteta and sporting director Edu Gaspar? Well, when it comes to stunning transfer theories, not many are better at it than Arsenal supporters and a brand new one has been created that involves Declan Rice with a midfield signing the priority between now and Tuesday night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Caicedo talk has to be a smokescreen"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, these Arsenal fans are unlikely to be proven right - well at least this month at least - as whilst Rice is reportedly a target for the Premier League leaders, it's said that any potential deal will happen at the end of the season with West Ham United understandably reluctant to sell before Tuesday

            <p>
                Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming of Universiti Malaya, a public health expert, said Malaysia has been one of the best countries in managing Covid-19 and has handled the pandemic well despite some initial hiccups

            <p>
                Public health expert Prof Dr Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia said the high number of deaths was unavoidable at one point as there was a severe health resource shortage and a lack of facilities, as well as proper isolation centres

                Besides Covid-19, Malaysia’s burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, hypertension and stroke are also high

            <p>
                Universiti Malaya professor of epidemiology and public health Prof Dr Sanjay Rampal said while the Health Ministry responded well to the initial pandemic, future resilience would be highly dependent on investments in public health and healthcare systems

                The International Court of Justice ruled in 2008 that Singapore had sovereignty over Pedra Branca
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In May 2018, Malaysia said it would discontinue an application for revision and a request for interpretation of the ICJ’s 2008 judgment
            </p>

                “Following the agreement between Malaysia and the Republic of Singapore on 23rd May 2018 to discontinue the two Applications, the ICJ by an Order dated 29th May 2018, had informed Malaysia and the Republic of Singapore that the Court had placed on record the discontinuance of the two Applications and directed the cases to be removed from the Court’s List,” the attorney-general at the time said

            <p>
                The matter was brought to the ICJ in 2003, and on May 23, 2008, it ruled that Singapore had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, while Middle Rocks was awarded to Malaysia and South Ledge belonged to the state in whose territorial waters it is located

            <p>
                As of December 2022, the average new car loan for a buyer with great credit was 8.6%, according to MyAutoloan

                But if you have bad credit, that average soars up to 22.16%

                That’s about as much as the interest rate on a credit card

            <p>
                If $400 goes into a car payment, and $300 to a credit card and more for student loans, suddenly you have far less cash on hand for your retirement

            <p>
                So why not pay down your mortgage too? It’s not just the cheaper borrowing costs, although with the average national mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed rate at 6.15%, that is an advantage

            <p>
                Aulas closing the door on a potential move could be seen as him trying to put pressure on Chelsea to increase their first offer and agree to let Gusto stay at Lyon on loan until the end of the season, which Chelsea have refused to agree to so far in the negotiations
            </p>

                Gusto has now played 47 times already with Lyon, his hometown club, including some European games and he is also on Didier Deschamps' radar for the national team after having represented France in every youth team
            </p>

                Asked if the Supreme Council will discuss the membership status of former party youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin, who had been critical of the party leadership as well as being vocal in wanting the top two posts to be contested, Ahmad Zahid said this will only be known after the meeting

                The application, which Ahmad Zahid said was bona fide (with good intentions), was to enable him to execute his duties in an official capacity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To enable a smooth movement in his official capacity as the Deputy Prime Minister, Ahmad Zahid said he was required to be in and out of the country and this would necessitate him holding his own passport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid also said that his travel document was needed, as it was required for him to apply for a diplomatic passport for official business inside and outside of the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said he has no intention to abscond or miss his court dates as he is still an MP and an active politician with all his family members still in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, Ahmad Zahid said it was reasonable for the court to consider approving his application as it would benefit the country's administration

                The application, which Ahmad Zahid said was bona fide (with good intentions), was to enable him to execute his duties in an official capacity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To enable a smooth movement in his official capacity as the Deputy Prime Minister, Ahmad Zahid said he was required to be in and out of the country and this would necessitate him holding his own passport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid also said that his travel document was needed, as it was required for him to apply for a diplomatic passport for official business inside and outside of the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said he has no intention to abscond or miss his court dates as he is still an MP and an active politician with all his family members still in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, Ahmad Zahid said it was reasonable for the court to consider approving his application as it would benefit the country's administration

            <p>
                Deputy Public Prosecutor Abdul Malik Ayob and lawyer Nabihah Meor Azli represented Ahmad Zahid during the case management

            <p>
                According to The Telegraph, Arsenal are actively showing interest in Caicedo as the club considers midfield options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An ideal alternative to Moises Caicedo would be Amadou Onana
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's believed Onana was on the Gunners' radar prior to his move to Merseyside, but again, he would not come cheaply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regardless of what happens in midfield, Arsenal beating the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Newcastle to land one of the hottest prospects in football would be an exciting piece of business in the remaining days of the window

                MANDATORY CREDIT MADRID (Reuters) -     An Iranian chess player who defected to Spain after she competed without a hijab and was warned not to return to her country met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Madrid on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She had taken part in the FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships held in Kazakhstan's Almaty in late December without a hijab - a headscarf mandatory under Iran's strict Islamic dress codes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In footage provided by the prime minister's office, Khadem is seen chatting with Sanchez on a couch while sporting a black suit and without wearing a hijab
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They later appear to engage in a game of chess at a table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "So I decided not to wear it anymore." Khadem is ranked 771st in the world, according to the International Chess Federation's website, and 9th in Iran

                MANDATORY CREDIT MADRID (Reuters) -     An Iranian chess player who defected to Spain after she competed without a hijab and was warned not to return to her country met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Madrid on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In footage provided by the prime minister's office, Khadem is seen chatting with Sanchez on a couch while sporting a black suit and without wearing a hijab
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They later appear to engage in a game of chess at a table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "So I decided not to wear it anymore." Khadem is ranked 771st in the world, according to the International Chess Federation's website, and 9th in Iran

                Latest Arsenal news takes a closer look at how Mohamed Elneny's injury setback could affect Mikel Arteta's plans leading up to transfer deadline day and the remainder of the season Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters The one downside coming out of Mikel Arteta's press conference ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup fourth round tie against Manchester City was the Mohamed Elneny injury update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But let’s see."  Whilst Elneny is by no means a regular under Arteta, he has proven to be a decent backup option for Thomas Partey at the base of Arsenal's midfield over the past six to eight months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One option, of course, is dipping into the transfer market before next Tuesday's deadline and Arteta himself has publicly stated that in an ideal world, he will be able to sign a midfielder

            <p>
                Having to rest Thomas today, I think it was a good option."  Hopefully, Elneny's injury isn't too serious and is available for selection soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in the event that he is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines and Arsenal don't manage to sign a replacement before the January transfer window closes then all signs point towards Arteta revisiting the Lokonga experiment as cover for Partey

                Biden thanked Germany for its decision to supply Ukraine with Leopard 2 tanks, and listed the other on-the-ground military hardware other NATO allies and other European countries were supplying

                Wednesday’s Tesla Q4 earnings report after the bell will be a big one — especially considering Tesla shares are hovering at 2-year lows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the profitability end, Tesla is expected to report adjusted net income of $3.98 billion, around $300 million more than Q3, and over $1.3 billion more than a year ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, investors will still be keen to track gross margin figures, which last quarter came in at 25.1%, with automotive gross margin hitting 27.9%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tesla’s long-term delivery target of 50% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) has remained in place despite deliveries missing the mark in recent quarters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, with recent price cuts reportedly boosting deliveries, and factory ramp ups ongoing at Giga Berlin and Giga Austin, it’s possible Tesla will keep its long-term delivery growth target intact

            <p>
                On the profitability end, Tesla is expected to report adjusted net income of $3.98 billion, around $300 million more than Q3, and over $1.3 billion more than a year ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, investors will still be keen to track gross margin figures, which last quarter came in at 25.1%, with automotive gross margin hitting 27.9%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tesla’s long-term delivery target of 50% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) has remained in place despite deliveries missing the mark in recent quarters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, with recent price cuts reportedly boosting deliveries, and factory ramp ups ongoing at Giga Berlin and Giga Austin, it’s possible Tesla will keep its long-term delivery growth target intact
