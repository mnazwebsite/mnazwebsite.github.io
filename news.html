                (Bloomberg) -- Turns out, the biggest short in the banking industry anywhere in the world isn’t in Switzerland or Silicon Valley, but rather, in the relatively tame financial center of Canada
            </p>
            
            <p>

                and a planned regional bank acquisition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, traders are “playing with short interest for TD more than normally” because the bank has become a merger arbitration play, according to Daneshvar Rohinton, a portfolio manager at Industrial Alliance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decline wiped out C$18.1 billion ($13.5 billion) from the bank’s market value
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Javice allegedly claimed that the startup had 4.25 million customers, but in reality, Frank had only about 300,000 clients, according to the lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Javice stood to gain more than $45 million from the fraud, the DOJ said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The DOJ charged Javice with separate counts of conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, according to the lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                JPMorgan Chase has also sued Charlie Javice, claiming the Frank founder and Olivier Amar, Frank’s chief growth officer, committed securities fraud, fraud with the contract, conspiracy to commit fraud, as well as aiding and abetting fraud for allegedly fabricating around 4 million nonexistent accounts that they said used Frank’s services
            </p>
            
            <p>
                JPMorgan Chase shut down the Frank website in January

                (AP) — Union Pacific routinely hires private investigators to check out employees' medical leave claims and then fires anyone who happens to leave their house while out on leave, according to a lawsuit filed against the railroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific says it didn’t do anything wrong when it fired De’Ron Rutledge because railroad managers believed he was abusing the medical leave rules by repeatedly taking time off as he was recovering from a back injury he suffered on the job
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spokeswoman Robynn Tysver said UP follows all the rules for providing Family Medical Leave Act time off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If we learn that an employee is misusing FMLA, Union Pacific may take disciplinary action, as permitted under the law.” This whole situation might be less of a problem if employees had paid sick time, but the railroads have only started to address that concern in recent months through agreements giving some of their unions four days of paid sick time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to his lawsuit, Rutledge had to take eight months off work to rehabilitate after the back injury in 2017 but after returning to the job he would occasionally need to take additional time off when his back condition flared up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ___ This story has been updated to correct that most conductors have not, rather than have, received paid sick time leave.

                In a media statement by Mahathir’s lawyers, Messrs Law Practice of Rafique, the law firm said that Anwar’s lawyers Messrs Thomas Philip had asked for a time extension to respond and that Anwar had requested for an extension until Monday, April 17

                On March 27, Mahathir had sent a LOD to Anwar demanding an apology and retraction of his comments within seven days of the date of the letter

            <p>
                In the letter, Mahathir also demanded that Anwar, who is also the PKR president, hold a press conference to retract and apologise unconditionally to him over the  statements, or face legal action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While he did not name anyone in the speech, Mahathir's lawyers, in the LOD, said Anwar's statements clearly referred to Mahathir

            <p>
                It is also meant to tarnish and affect Mahathir’s reputation as a former PM, a statesman, who is respected all over the world,” the LOD stated

                Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s lieutenant at Berkshire Hathaway and a veteran long-term investor, thinks this kind of speculative trading is akin to an addiction—one that it should be done away with
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On the other hand, I think the chances of changing it are practically zero.” Munger believes the effects of speculative trading caused the Great Depression, which started with the worst stock market crash in history in 1929
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the time that Munger gave the interview, meme stocks like GameStop and AMC had surged almost 100-fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Maybe it would happen once or twice a year

            <p>
                Now they trade billions of shares every day.” Buffett’s business partner has spoken several times about how speculative investing can harm the stock market, and simply won’t work as a strategy for investors over the long term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To be sure, this isn’t the only category of investing that Munger is critical of

                Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s lieutenant at Berkshire Hathaway and a veteran long-term investor, thinks this kind of speculative trading is akin to an addiction—one that it should be done away with
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On the other hand, I think the chances of changing it are practically zero.” Munger believes the effects of speculative trading caused the Great Depression, which started with the worst stock market crash in history in 1929
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the time that Munger gave the interview, meme stocks like GameStop and AMC had surged almost 100-fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Maybe it would happen once or twice a year

            <p>
                Now they trade billions of shares every day.” Buffett’s business partner has spoken several times about how speculative investing can harm the stock market, and simply won’t work as a strategy for investors over the long term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To be sure, this isn’t the only category of investing that Munger is critical of

                Spun off from Branson’s space tourism firm Virgin Galactic in 2017, Virgin Orbit air-launches rockets from beneath a modified Boeing 747 plane to send satellites into orbit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Virgin Orbit’s sixth mission in January with its centerpiece LauncherOne rocket, the first rocket launch out of Britain, failed to reach orbit and sent its payload of US and UK intelligence satellites plunging into the ocean

                Virgin Group funding Branson’s Virgin Group, which owned roughly 75 per cent of the launch company, said it had invested over US$1 billion in the unit, including $60 million in secured loans since November

                Virgin Investments, a unit of Virgin Group, will provide US$31.6 million in new money to Virgin Orbit through debtor-in-possession financing to fund operations while it looks for a buyer in bankruptcy, the companies said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Virgin Orbit had a market value of US$65 million based on Monday’s closing price, down from more than US$3 billion two years ago

                Tuesday's shareholder meeting marks an ignominious end for the 167-year-old flagship bank founded by Alfred Escher, a Swiss magnate affectionately dubbed King Alfred I, who helped build the country's railways and then Credit Suisse

                After a run on deposits, the Swiss government turned to UBS, which agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), a fraction of its earlier market value

                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said it is also agreed that the payment of the allowance is extended to include weekends

            <p>
                "I have also asked the Public Service Department (PSD) and the Ministry of Health (MoF) to look into this facility so that the on-call allowance could be extended to all other than medical officers,” he said during Minister’s Question Time at the Dewan Rakyat sitting here on Tuesday (April 4)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said this in reply to a supplementary question by Datuk Seri Wilfred Madius Tangau (PH-Tuaran) who wanted to know whether the government is planning to raise the on-call allowance for doctors in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister said even though the current rate of the on-call allowance is appropriate, it needs to be raised as the allowance did not include doctors working in health clinics or hospital emergency departments

                Given this, an opportunity seems to have been opened for scammers to pose as legitimate Baju Raya sellers online in a bid to con ususpecting shoppers

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, April 4 — The Federal Court here today struck out an application by two Sabahans to get leave to appeal to reinstate a lawsuit against PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang for alleged seditious remarks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohamad Zabidin, who delivered the court’s unanimous in an online proceeding, struck out the application with no order as to costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 7, 2021, High Court judge Datuk Akhtar Tahir allowed Abdul Hadi’s application to strike out the suit filed by the two men, who then lost their appeal which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on Aug 16 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court was supposed to hear their application for leave to appeal today, but Abdul Hadi’s lawyer, Yusfarizal Yussoff, raised a preliminary objection saying that there was no valid affidavit to support the application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yusfarizal, assisted by lawyer Adam Luqman Amdan, also said there was no application made by the applicants to seek leave of the court to use the defective affidavit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He told the court that attempts to get in touch with Maklin to affirm the affidavit were unsuccessful and requested the court to give him another chance to get the affidavit affirmed

            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Mah Sing has more than 40 years of entrepreneurship experience in manufacturing and property development in Malaysia, and we believe our extensive experience makes us the ideal partner for Chinese companies looking to invest here in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Our relationships with these Chinese companies will also help to expand Malaysia-China economic and trade relations."

                The fast food chain restaurant is shuttering its US offices this week as the company prepares to restructure and inform employees about layoffs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fast-food chain told corporate staff to work remotely Monday through Wednesday to provide confidentiality while it cuts hundreds of jobs, according to a person familiar with the company’s plans

            <p>
                Workers at Alphabet Inc’s Google have criticised the company’s recent mass layoffs and called for, among other things, future job cuts to be conducted in person so that employees can say goodbye to colleagues
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the past when a company had a large-scale layoff, such as a plant closure, the bosses would gather everyone together and tell them at the same time, said Sandra Sucher, a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School who studies trust between employers and employees

                There had also been speculation that De Zerbi was a potential candidate for Chelsea, given his success since replacing Potter at Brighton, but sources close to Chelsea have confirmed he is not of interest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that no appointment is imminent with Chelsea set to adopt a different approach in hiring Potter's successor, with the search set to be led by sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart

                Craig Burley discusses why he isn't surprised with Chelsea sacking manager Graham Potter and the club's recent decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - Inside story of why Chelsea sacked Graham Potter Sources have told ESPN that Julian Nagelsmann is on the shortlist, while the club are expected to sound out Mauricio Pochettino and Luis Enrique over the role
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There had also been speculation that De Zerbi was a potential candidate for Chelsea, given his success since replacing Potter at Brighton, but sources close to Chelsea have confirmed he is not of interest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that no appointment is imminent with Chelsea set to adopt a different approach in hiring Potter's successor, with the search set to be led by sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - Potter was wrong choice for Chelsea from the start
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Potter's former assistant Bruno Saltor will take interim charge of the first team for Tuesday's Premier League home clash with Liverpool

                Of course, the ideal situation for United would be to see De Gea extend his time at United, after he’s recovered spectacularly well from that previously mentioned dip in form, as well as bringing in Raya before the likes of Tottenham snatch him up

                KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Reuters) - Malaysia's parliament on Monday passed sweeping legal reforms to remove the mandatory death penalty, trim the number of offences punishable by death, and abolish natural-life prison sentences, a move cautiously welcomed by rights groups

            <p>
                Under the amendments passed, alternatives to the death penalty include whipping and imprisonment of between 30 to 40 years

                Acting Kuala Lumpur police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Yahaya Othman said in a statement on Monday (April 3) that the video apparently showed a policeman conducting an inspection near the Memorial Tunku Abdul Rahman signboard at Bulatan Datuk Onn here

            <p>
                "Preliminary investigations showed that the complainant alleged in a video that the extortion occurred after (she failed) to produce identification," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier in the day, it was alleged in a TikTok video that a Chinese national had been extorted after she failed to produce her passport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The video includes the police stop but it gets cut off after the officer asks for identification.

            <p>
                Abdul Rahman, who was chairing the five-judge bench, was the only judge who dissented or disagreed with the majority

            <p>
                On July 28, 2020, then High Court judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali found Najib guilty of all seven charges — three for criminal breach of trust, three for money laundering, and one for abuse of power — at the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Nazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal judge, then sentenced Najib to 12 years in prison and fined him RM210 million in default five years imprisonment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on December 8, 2021.

                Erik ten Hag was surprised Manchester United's players failed to match the intensity of Newcastle in their 2-0 defeat on what he admitted was "not a good day"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Newcastle had 22 attempts to United's six in a dominant performance that lifted them above Ten Hag's team into third place in the Premier League table
            </p>

                United beat Newcastle 2-0 in the League Cup final five weeks ago and Ten Hag felt that was a source of motivation for the hosts and Luke Shaw said Newcastle "wanted it more"

                Luke Shaw admitted Manchester United's players had a frank discussion among themselves in the dressing room following Sunday's 2-0 defeat to Newcastle United at St James' Park
            </p>

                "Bakhmut is Ukrainian and they have not captured anything and are very far from doing that, to put it mildly," he told Reuters

                A 'supercomputer' has predicted Liverpool's chances of Champions League qualification with 11 games to go, following Newcastle's win over Manchester United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But that wasn't the end of the weekend's action, and Liverpool was quickly left to wonder about the ramifications of Newcastle United's big win over Manchester United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What are the chances of Liverpool finishing in the final Champions League spot? On the surface, one would say it's slim, and this is borne out in mathematical terms, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tottenham has a 26 per cent chance of playing Champions League football again next season, while Newcastle and Manchester United, who both currently occupy the final spots, respectively have a 64 per cent and 66 per cent chance of holding their ground

                A 'supercomputer' has predicted Liverpool's chances of Champions League qualification with 11 games to go, following Newcastle's win over Manchester United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But that wasn't the end of the weekend's action, and Liverpool was quickly left to wonder about the ramifications of Newcastle United's big win over Manchester United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What are the chances of Liverpool finishing in the final Champions League spot? On the surface, one would say it's slim, and this is borne out in mathematical terms, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tottenham has a 26 per cent chance of playing Champions League football again next season, while Newcastle and Manchester United, who both currently occupy the final spots, respectively have a 64 per cent and 66 per cent chance of holding their ground

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple recommends that the backup drive have at least double the storage of the drive being backed up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When creating a backup strategy that works best for you, it’s important to prioritise which data to back up first
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For instance, if you own a desktop or laptop, you should back up your data to an external drive and the cloud
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And having your data on the cloud will ensure that your data is safe should you lose both your local storage due to, say, fire or flood
            </p>
            
            <p>
                David recommends taking the extra step of encrypting the backup data

                President Donald Trump's indictment by a Manhattan grand jury following a probe into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, in New York City, U.S., April 1, 2023

                MPAJ enforcement officers will be carrying out frequent checks from April to enforce the two-hour parking limit

            <p>
                Sivakumar lauded the two-hour parking initiative but said better enforcement was needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 22, MBPJ introduced the hot zone parking system at the Section 52 commercial area

            <p>
                In Ampang Jaya, the two-hour parking limit has been introduced in only one area – the busy Jalan Memanda commercial district – nearby Ampang Point mall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “MPAJ did not issue any compounds or tow vehicles that did not abide by the two-hour parking limit as long as users paid the parking charges,” she said

                It was previously reported that the Selayang Municipal Council (MPS) also has plans to introduce a two-hour limit for on-street parking

                Of the 1.15m-barrel cut announced, Saudi Arabia plans to cut output by 500,000 barrels per day, Iraq by 211,000 barrels per day and the UAE by 144,000 barrels per day

            <p>
                Moscow announced the 500,000 barrel per day cut unilaterally in February, in response to price caps on its oil imposed by G7 countries

            <p>
                In its latest monthly oil market report, covering February, the International Energy Agency said oil demand was set to rise by 2 million barrels of oil per day in 2023 to 101.9 million barrels per day

                So is Russia, a member of the Opec-plus coalition, which plans to extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 barrels per day until the end of 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moscow announced the 500,000 barrel per day cut unilaterally in February, in response to price caps on its oil imposed by G7 countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its latest monthly oil market report, covering February, the International Energy Agency said oil demand was set to rise by 2 million barrels of oil per day in 2023 to 101.9 million barrels per day

                "We are on track to achieve the targets -- for example, this year, for inflation to be between 2.8 per cent and 3.8 per cent and economic growth to be between four and five per cent,” he told reporters after the annual BNM Governor's Address on the Malaysian Economy forum organised by the Malaysian Economic Association today

                Earlier in his keynote address, Fraziali said the monetary policy would continue to balance the risks to domestic inflation and economic growth and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will continue to monitor the impact of the past OPR adjustments on the economy

                According to the BNM Economic and Monetary Review 2022, the MPC monetary policy considerations would focus on managing inflation risks while supporting sustainable economic growth in 2023, and similar to other economies, 2023 will be a challenging year for the Malaysian economy with a more moderate economic growth projected and inflation expected to remain elevated

            <p>
                BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus in the report said over-adjustments in monetary policy would negatively impact growth, while undershooting could lead to inflation expectations becoming unhinged with damaging effects on consumers’ purchasing power and the sustainability of economic growth

                Meanwhile, the bench dismissed Muhammad Sanusi’s appeal to set aside the High Court’s decision, made on November 8, 2021, which ordered him to pay damages to Mahfuz after allowing the latter’s (Mahfuz) defamation lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the court’s decision, Justice Vazeer said that there was no error by the High Court judge in his findings on liability, but said that the quantum of damages awarded to Mahfuz by the High Court was low
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sanusi’s lawyer, Yusfarizal Yussoff as well as Noorazmir Zakaria, representing Mahfuz, confirmed the Court of Appeal’s decision when contacted by Bernama

            <p>
                In November 2021, High Court Judicial Commissioner Datuk Mohd Arief Emran Arifin allowed Mahfuz’s defamation suit and ordered Muhammad Sanusi to pay RM50,000 in damages to Mahfuz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Judicial Commissioner also gave an injunction order to restrain Muhammad Sanusi or his agents from further publishing defamatory words against Mahfuz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mahfuz filed the suit on Oct 9, 2029, over a post made by Muhammad Sanusi on his Facebook account on July 30 the same year, linking Mahfuz as the Pokok Sena Member of Parliament to the matter of the transfer of a Sports Toto outlet to the area

                Although the Federal Court reached a split decision to reject the former prime minister’s application for review, Malaysian Bar president Karen Cheah said the majority ruling stood
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah also said in a statement that a Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigation on former High Court judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, who first decided Najib’s case, had no bearing as the agency was not the authority to oversee the judiciary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Investigations by the MACC in this regard are not only without jurisdiction, but also begs the question as to why MACC has traversed into areas that are not within the scope of the MACC Act 2009, nor within competence of the MACC,” Cheah said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah also said the sole dissenting judge in the Federal Court decision to reject Najib’s review application did not nullify the majority decision

                He also previously claimed the 4-1 decision against Najib was “not the end” for him in the SRC International case

            <p>
                Last week, the majority decision by four judges on the panel rejected Najib’s challenge against his conviction and jail sentence in the SRC case, and effectively endorsed the August 2022 decision of the Federal Court panel chaired by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat which had ordered Najib to begin serving his 12-year sentence

            <p>
                By contrast, at Liverpool, while the situation with Klopp's squad has been at the other extreme at times this season, particularly in midfield, it has at least allowed the prodigiously talented Stefan Bajčetić to emerge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The situation at Liverpool this season has been far from perfect, of course, and this season, even if it ends with Champions League football being secured, will have been a disappointment

            <p>
                But the joined-up thinking required to put that right is already in place, as Chelsea could suffer the unexpected consequences of a scattergun approach at the other end of the spectrum — allowing Liverpool and others to profit.

                “Now, how will Mikel Arteta’s side react? That was a statement performance from Manchester City, the pressure is now on Arsenal.”  Pressure? What pressure?  For Arsenal, this was a statement of their own, a statement made without producing their finest football, a statement that tells Pep Guardiola and City that the Premier League leaders are taking this title race in their elegant stride
            </p>

                And if the commentary and analysis was audible, the Arsenal supporters would have heard the same question time and time over
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Now, how will Mikel Arteta’s side react? That was a statement performance from Manchester City, the pressure is now on Arsenal.”  Pressure? What pressure?  For Arsenal, this was a statement of their own, a statement made without producing their finest football, a statement that tells Pep Guardiola and City that the Premier League leaders are taking this title race in their elegant stride
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Arteta did not even have to start his best player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is why Pep loved him, that is why Mikel loves him, that is why Arsenal fans love him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in truth, after that mediocre early spell, Arsenal won this game in a canter

            <p>
                Over half a million dollars for a home is a lot of money for most Americans, but what does that look like in a monthly mortgage payment and how do you know if you can actually afford a home at that price point? Figuring out whether you can afford a home is a lot more involved than just looking at the home’s sticker price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are several rules and guidelines you can use to determine how much you can comfortably afford to pay for a home
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, these figures are highly dependent on mortgage rates (which fluctuate regularly) and your down payment

                A change in rates or a higher or lower down payment can significantly impact your monthly payment

                For fiscal years 2018 through 2022, Altria has paid out over $30 billion in dividends, and repurchased more than $6 billion in stock shares
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Altria has kept up reliable dividend payments since 1989
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the past year, the company has regularly paid out both a base dividend and a variable dividend to all common shareholders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At that rate, the base dividend yields 2.4%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With it came a variable dividend declaration, of $2.15 per share, bringing the total dividend payment for 4Q22 to $2.95
            </p>

                For fiscal years 2018 through 2022, Altria has paid out over $30 billion in dividends, and repurchased more than $6 billion in stock shares

                (Bloomberg) -- Lincoln Power LLC, the owner of two Illinois power plants, filed for bankruptcy after its financial strain was exacerbated by nearly $39 million in penalties levied by the biggest US electric-grid operator

                A Group One winner over 2,000m in Chile pre-import, Alacrity could not quite get up to speed in time to mount an assault on last month’s Hong Kong Derby, but the four-year-old’s victory in the Class Three Tan Shan River Handicap (1,800m) showed he will not be wasting any more time

                Tze Liang, whose highest achievement was winning gold in the men’s 3 metre (m) springboard at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, has thrown down the gauntlet to his compatriots to step up in a bid to create more bigger splashes in the pool

                They have to win first,” he told reporters after taking home gold in the men’s 3m springboard at the 58th Malaysia Invitational Age Group (MIAG) Diving Championships here, today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the 29-year-old diver won’t be joining the 2023 SEA Games squad, he hoped that both Muhammad Syafiq Puteh and Gabriel Gilbert Daim will go all out so as to maintain their gold and silver medals respectively in the men’s 3m springboard event at the biennial games in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, next month

                Earlier, Tze Liang oozed class as he amassed 452.35 points to emerge as champion followed by another national diver Chew Yi Wei, who took silver with 407.10 points while Muhammad Syafiq had to settle for bronze with 402.70 points
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite unable to overcome Tze Liang in the men’s 3m springboard, Yi Wei still managed to take home gold for the national team, this time in the men’s synchronised 3m springboard with Gabriel after collecting 341.49 points

                More than a dozen people died while other were reported missing after an inter-island cargo and passenger ferry with about 200 passengers and crew onboard caught fire close to midnight in the southern Philippines, a provincial governor said Thursday

                Xi said this during a meeting with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim on Friday (March 31) after attending the Boao Forum for Asia on the island province of Hainan, according to China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying

Meanwhile, Hua said Xi also met Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a separate meet where the Chinese President told Lee that the "Asian region has blazed a development path featuring independence, mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, openness, inclusion and win-win cooperation with Asian characteristics." "In a world with fast-evolving major changes unseen in a century, we need to value and defend the hard-won development momentum, firmly reject hegemony and bullying, and not allow any country to deprive Asian people of the right to pursue a better life," Xi told Lee

                Here’s how to make a six-figure income and pay no income taxes on it – all legally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tack on another $27,700 in income that is tax-free from a standard deduction, and you can escape income tax on at least $116,950
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By way of the deduction, all taxpayers get the first portion of their income tax-free
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard deduction can reduce any kind of income, such as investment income or earned income (money from a job)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Making $116,950 in tax-free income sounds great
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moving to a no-tax state – there are nine states with no income tax currently – can drastically reduce your tax burden

                Here’s how to make a six-figure income and pay no income taxes on it – all legally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tack on another $27,700 in income that is tax-free from a standard deduction, and you can escape income tax on at least $116,950
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By way of the deduction, all taxpayers get the first portion of their income tax-free
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard deduction can reduce any kind of income, such as investment income or earned income (money from a job)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Making $116,950 in tax-free income sounds great
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moving to a no-tax state – there are nine states with no income tax currently – can drastically reduce your tax burden
            </p>

                by Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has given the go-ahead to sign Benfica striker Goncalo Ramos during the summer transfer window, according to AS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ramos has been one of those and it is now reported that United have shown the ‘most interest’ in signing  him from Benfica at the end of the campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Benfica are unlikely to sell Ramos for less than his €120 million release clause this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, his reputation is rising quickly and United will need to move fast to secure his services ahead of their European rivals in the next transfer window
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nuan Nuan was sent back to China in 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the agreement, each giant panda cub must be sent back to China when it reaches 24 months of age and no more than four years old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The presence of pandas at the Giant Panda Conservation Centre also contributed to the increase in the number of visitors and helped boost Zoo Negara’s income.

                Casemiro will miss Man United's next three Premier League fixtures after being sent-off prior to the international break

                Having introduced it for US companies late last year, Twitter’s verification programme for organisations has gone global

            <p>
                In Malaysia, it will cost RM4,500 per month for verification, and another RM230 per month if you want an affiliate (like a subsidiary brand, a leader, a spokesperson or an employee) vetted as well

            <p>
                As with Twitter Blue, the cost to get a gold checkmark in Malaysia is broadly similar to the US, where you’ll need to pay USD1,000 per month (around RM4,412) for verification and USD50 per month (around RM221) to add an affiliate

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 — Student group Ikatan Mahasiswa Demokratik Malaysia today chided Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Roziah Mohd Janor for claiming that it did not submit an application to host a dialogue session that was blocked by the university this week

                “This allegation is also very one-sided because the vice chancellor's office has not only denied the students' right to dialogue peacefully, but has even defamed us.” The student group affiliated with Malaysian United Democratic Alliance (Muda) said that UiTM had no problem approving the application and no issue was raised after it sent the documents applying to hold the dialogue session

            <p>
                It also said that a letter has been sent to the vice-chancellor’s office on March 27 to notify the university's top officials of the event

                Prior to that, UiTM warned its students against participating in the dialogue session as students were only allowed to participate in programmes on-campus that have the university’s approval.

                This new duty will be imposed beginning tomorrow (April 1) following the commencement of the Excise Duties (Amendment) Order 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new duty was sighted in a federal government gazette notice released today (March 31) on the Federal Legislation Portal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Excise Duties (Amendment) Order 2023 was delivered by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim under subsection 6(1) of the Excise Act 1976
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The gazette would be presented before the Dewan Rakyat pursuant to subsection 6(2) of the Excise Act 1976
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the tabling of the Budget 2023 in February, Anwar said the government planned to impose an excise duty on vape products
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said the government supported the generational endgame Bill (GEG) and agreed that half of the proceeds from this excise duty would be allocated to the Health Ministry as an effort to improve the quality of health services

                “Apart from the lack of permanent posts, there are many other issues that are causing frustration among the public health care workforce which the government should focus on resolving now as some of the issues do not even require financial commitment to resolve,” he said in a statement today

            <p>
                On Wednesday, Anwar assured contract doctors that 1,500 of them would be made permanent this year and the government would need three years to resolve the problems they faced

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Public Health Organisation Malaysia advisor Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar, when contacted by Bernama, said the government assurance to resolve the contract doctor issues had given hope to the doctors involved and their families
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saying the government promise to absorb contract doctors into permanent service this year is a short-term solution, he suggested that the government look into the rate of appointment in relation to the number of existing contract doctors

            <p>
                Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Services (Cuepacs) president Datuk Adnan Mat hoped that the Health Ministry and Public Service Department (JPA) would get Cuepacs involved in discussions to resolve the contract doctor issues

            <p>
                Adnan said going on strike would not resolve any issues and instead would create more problems especially for the people, who want the best service

                “Apart from the lack of permanent posts, there are many other issues that are causing frustration among the public health care workforce which the government should focus on resolving now as some of the issues do not even require financial commitment to resolve,” he said in a statement today

                On Wednesday, Anwar assured contract doctors that 1,500 of them would be made permanent this year and the government would need three years to resolve the problems they faced
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Public Health Organisation Malaysia advisor Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar, when contacted by Bernama, said the government assurance to resolve the contract doctor issues had given hope to the doctors involved and their families
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saying the government promise to absorb contract doctors into permanent service this year is a short-term solution, he suggested that the government look into the rate of appointment in relation to the number of existing contract doctors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Services (Cuepacs) president Datuk Adnan Mat hoped that the Health Ministry and Public Service Department (JPA) would get Cuepacs involved in discussions to resolve the contract doctor issues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adnan said going on strike would not resolve any issues and instead would create more problems especially for the people, who want the best service

                While Ahmad’s Zahid management of UMNO is an internal party matter, the appointments to state agencies run counter to pledges the Pakatan Harapan (PH)-led coalition government made during the November polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid's actions have not only become a lightning rod for the opposition leaders, who are accusing Mr Anwar of backsliding on his election promises to bring about reforms in return for ensuring UMNO’s continued support for the coalition government.  They are also fuelling unease among senior PH leaders, who have long been wary about Mr Anwar’s move to strike a partnership with Ahmad Zahid and UMNO, sources told CNA.  “Making a deal with (Ahmad) Zahid and UMNO was always going to be problematic and that is now playing out,” said a senior PH minister, who also added that the issues over the appointments were being unfairly amplified because Ahmad Zahid was exercising his authority as minister over appointments involving agencies under his ministry.  “The problem with UMNO is that it believes it is business as usual even as a minority partner (in government) and Anwar’s challenge is to make sure that he draws the line when it comes to GLCs,” said the PH politician
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current uneasiness over how Ahmad Zahid has positioned his allies in government agencies reflects the messy state of Malaysia’s coalition politics following the 15th General Election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stakes are high for both Anwar and Ahmad Zahid on how the ruling coalition performs in the Malay-belt states
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Should UMNO show no improvement in the support from the Malays, the outcome would be considered a rejection of UMNO and Ahmad Zahid, who is battling corruption charges in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister, too, will have to account to his supporters for being too accommodating to UMNO.

                The prosecution filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal on Sept 26 last year against the Shah Alam High Court's decision to acquit and discharge Ahmad Zahid, who is now deputy prime minister, of all the charges after ruling that the prosecution had not made out a prima facie case against him

            <p>
                According to the charge sheet, Ahmad Zahid was alleged to have committed those offences at Seri Satria, Precinct 16, Putrajaya and Country Heights, Kajang, between October 2014 and March 2018

                Gerawat was replying to Sarawak Timber Association (STA) chairman Dato Henry Lau’s call to the state government to expedite the entry process of foreign workers from source countries other than Indonesia for the timber industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the timber industry, 250 APs have been approved in 2022 and only 24 were utilised, leaving a balance of 226 unutilised APs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that from January to March this year, 280 APs were approved for the timber industry, all of which have yet to be utilised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On STA’s complaint that the time taken to get approval was too long, Gerawat said his ministry had organised a review of the internal processes for hiring of foreign general workers which was jointly conducted by the state’s Department of Labour, Immigration Department, and the Immigration and Labour Management Unit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To further improve this process, Gerawat said the state cabinet had also approved his ministry’s proposal for the engagement of a vendor to develop an end to end digital platform to digitise all the components relating to the processing of foreign workers application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will slash approval time for foreign workers, enhance transparency, ensure integrity of the process for foreign workers applications and enable the enforcement and regulatory authorities to effectively monitor the entry and movement of foreign workers within the state, he added

                Now, it has emerged that Man Utd have also become a threat in the battle for Ndicka’s signature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Football Insider, Erik ten Hag’s side may well be the main rival to Liverpool on that front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report reminds that Man Utd are willing to sell club captain Harry Maguire in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judging from Football Insider‘s information, it could be a two-horse race between Man Utd and Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joining Man Utd might be more attractive at present because of their better form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, Ndicka might be able to carve out his own role more clearly with Liverpool

                Now, it has emerged that Man Utd have also become a threat in the battle for Ndicka’s signature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Football Insider, Erik ten Hag’s side may well be the main rival to Liverpool on that front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report reminds that Man Utd are willing to sell club captain Harry Maguire in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judging from Football Insider‘s information, it could be a two-horse race between Man Utd and Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joining Man Utd might be more attractive at present because of their better form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, Ndicka might be able to carve out his own role more clearly with Liverpool
            </p>

                The central bank said the DuitNow-NETS QR code payment linkage is a key milestone in the ongoing collaboration between Malaysia and Singapore to enhance cross-border payment connectivity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said the cross-border QR code payment linkage is a "significant step forward in realising the vision of an Asean network of fast, efficient, and interconnected retail payment systems.” "The QR linkage between Malaysia and Singapore will benefit millions of commuters across the Causeway as well as business and leisure travelers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to BNM, the initiative is a testament to both countries’ commitment to improving the cost, speed, access, and transparency of cross-border payments, in line with the Asean Payment Connectivity Initiative and the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank said the payment linkage would support in-person payments through the scanning of physical QR codes displayed by merchants, and online cross-border e-commerce transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the next phase, BNM and MAS plan to expand the payment linkage to enable cross-border account-to-account fund transfers and remittances, which would allow users to make real-time fund transfers between Malaysia and Singapore conveniently using just the recipient’s mobile phone number via DuitNow and PayNow

                The central bank said the DuitNow-NETS QR code payment linkage is a key milestone in the ongoing collaboration between Malaysia and Singapore to enhance cross-border payment connectivity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said the cross-border QR code payment linkage is a "significant step forward in realising the vision of an Asean network of fast, efficient, and interconnected retail payment systems.” "The QR linkage between Malaysia and Singapore will benefit millions of commuters across the Causeway as well as business and leisure travelers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to BNM, the initiative is a testament to both countries’ commitment to improving the cost, speed, access, and transparency of cross-border payments, in line with the Asean Payment Connectivity Initiative and the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank said the payment linkage would support in-person payments through the scanning of physical QR codes displayed by merchants, and online cross-border e-commerce transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the next phase, BNM and MAS plan to expand the payment linkage to enable cross-border account-to-account fund transfers and remittances, which would allow users to make real-time fund transfers between Malaysia and Singapore conveniently using just the recipient’s mobile phone number via DuitNow and PayNow

                Man Utd travel to face Newcastle in the Premier League this weekend and the match could have a huge say in their season

            <p>
                United could yet win another two trophies before the end of the season and qualify for the Champions League, but first they must navigate one of their toughest tests yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United have taken 30 points at home this season, but just 20 in away matches this campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United could end the next match day in third, but they could also finish it in fifth due to their inferior goal difference compared with top-four rivals Tottenham and Newcastle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It would still take a sizeable collapse for United to drop out of the top-four, and they would also have to rely on their competitors to take advantage of such a slump
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United's next match really is their most important

                Man Utd travel to face Newcastle in the Premier League this weekend and the match could have a huge say in their season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United could yet win another two trophies before the end of the season and qualify for the Champions League, but first they must navigate one of their toughest tests yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United have taken 30 points at home this season, but just 20 in away matches this campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United could end the next match day in third, but they could also finish it in fifth due to their inferior goal difference compared with top-four rivals Tottenham and Newcastle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It would still take a sizeable collapse for United to drop out of the top-four, and they would also have to rely on their competitors to take advantage of such a slump
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United's next match really is their most important

                Retirement Income From $2.5 Million A retirement nest egg of $2.5 million can likely produce an annual income of $100,000 for as long as you are likely to live
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if inflation runs at the 2% rate that is the target of federal policymakers, the retiree will withdraw $100,000 the first year of retirement, $102,000 the second year, $104,040 the third year and so on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This would permit a 65-year-old retiree to maintain consistent purchasing power until age 95 and beyond

                The jury was sequestered for around two hours before they returned to completely deny Sanderson’s claim, and to award Paltrow the $1 that she had asked for

                De Gea is facing an uncertain future at Man Utd after rejecting their opening offer of a new contract

                Man Utd want De Gea to reduce his wages before agreeing to stay at the club

            <p>
                By making such a move, De Gea would reunite with former Man Utd boss Jose Mourinho, who gave him 113 of his 529 appearances for the club to date

                If Man Utd haven’t been able to offer him enough yet, it is unlikely that Roma could usurp them

            <p>
                But if there was a way for the transfer to materialise, De Gea might reunite with ex-Man Utd defender Chris Smalling and midfielder Nemanja Matic

            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Man Utd haven’t been able to offer him enough yet, it is unlikely that Roma could usurp them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if there was a way for the transfer to materialise, De Gea might reunite with ex-Man Utd defender Chris Smalling and midfielder Nemanja Matic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, other sources have indicated there is still a confidence that he will renew his contract with Man Utd

                FOREIGN submarines must seek permission from Malaysian authorities should they want to sail submerged while in the country’s waters, says Defence Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad said the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) is clear on this issue, requiring any submarine passing through the territory of another nation to be on the surface
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If a foreign submarine, whether conventional or nuclear powered, wants to sail submerged underwater in our waters, permission must be sought from the Royal Malaysian Navy,” the Defence Minister said when answering a question raised by Lim Guan Eng (PH-Bagan)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim had asked about Malaysia’s stand on the recent A$368bil (RM1.08 trillion) deal by Australia to purchase eight submarines under the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (Aukus) enhanced security partnership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This was followed by a call from the United States Secretary of Defence and a meeting with the minister of state at the Ministry of Defence, the United Kingdom, on March 28,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad said during the discussions, he made it clear that Malaysia’s position on Aukus remains

                Premier League • England A Man Utd attacker has sent a message to Erik ten Hag over his minutes, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed two deals for the same player could soon be sanctioned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His first start for the club came on March 16 as Man Utd saw off Real Betis in the Europa League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, speaking to ESPN during the recent international break, Pellistri revealed his hunger to earn more minutes under Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Romano claimed another loan move could be sanctioned this summer, though only if he signs a new deal first
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “What’s going on right now is that for Pellistri, Man Utd are prepared to offer him a new contract and then decide if they want to send him on loan next season or keep him in the squad,” said Romano
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is something that, of course, has to be decided with Ten Hag.” Romano added Pellistri had loan proposals in January from “Bologna and Sassuolo in Italy, some Spanish clubs but also Flamengo in Brazil.” Ten Hag refused to greenlight a mid-season exit, though the story may be different six months later

                First Citizens Bank picked up assets from collapsed Silicon Valley Bank at a deep discount, a deal negotiated in part by a billionaire family well-versed in buying failed banks.  Forbes looked at the Holding Family, the North Carolina banking dynasty behind First Citizens BancShares, which saw an opportunity to expand its banking empire after this month's implosion of SVB.  First Citizen's growth has accelerated in part through the purchases of more than 20 failed small banks since the 2008 global financial crisis, the report said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cumulative stake was worth $2.7 billion after a 54% stock price surge Monday following the SVB deal.  First Citizens with the SVB transaction is moving into the ranks of the largest 20 banks in the US, with $219 billion in assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its purchases of failed banks include First Regional Bank and Temecula Valley Bank in California and Denver-based United Western Bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its assets jumped from $109 billion just before the SVB deal and have increased from $16.7 billion at the end of 2008.  Before the SVB agreement, First Citizens' largest deal was the $2.2 billion buyout of bankrupt CIT Group in January 2022.  Under terms of the SVB deal, First Citizens, for a $16.5 billion discount, is taking over $119 billion in deposits and $72 billion worth of the failed bank's loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The FDIC will hold onto about $90 billion worth of securities and other assets.  First Citizens, founded in 1898, got underway as Bank of Smithfield and focused on farmers in Johnston County, North Carolina, Forbes stated

                Real estate investment guru Grant Cardone has given a tentative nod to the hot new trend of tokenized real estate — but he has his reservations

                Real estate tokenization converts the value of real estate into digital tokens stored on a blockchain

            <p>
                This method enables fractional real estate ownership, which allows a broader group of investors to invest directly in real estate of all kinds, including commercial, residential or trophy

            <p>
                But Uncle G has one big reservation about trading real estate as a digital asset — “everybody … forgets one little group called the SEC.” Generally, the SEC considers real estate tokens as “securities,” meaning they’re subject to disclosure and registration requirements, unlike pure brick-and-mortar real estate investments

                There is no age cap on your ability to convert to a Roth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also no earned income requirement to convert to a Roth

                A financial advisor may help you understand how to manage the tax repercussions of a Roth conversion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Roth conversions make the most sense when you can choose to pay the income tax on your IRA balance and move it to a Roth in a relatively low-income tax year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other Tax Implications Federal income tax gets all the attention when Roth conversions come up

                What Are RMDs? You don’t pay taxes on the money in your IRA or 401(k) when you put it in, which is why these accounts are considered tax-advantaged retirement accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The money will be taxed according to your current tax bracket in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is beneficial if you are in a lower tax bracket in retirement than you were when you first earned the money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before the SECURE 2.0 Act, or the Securing a Strong Retirement Act, was signed into law, you had to take RMDs following the year you turn 72 or 70.5 if you were born before July 1, 1949
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line The SECURE 2.0 Act gives your tax-advantaged account more time to grow tax free before you have to withdraw money and, therefore, pay taxes on that money

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 31 — A large group of people did not miss the opportunity to turn a turf of cow grass from the Bukit Jalil National Stadium field here today into a memorable memento in their backyard or football field

            <p>
                The grass at the hallowed turf of the national football team was also the venue for the Harimau Malaya squad to qualify for the 2023 Asian Cup on merit, ending a wait of more than four decades last June, in addition to other sports and entertainment events
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the football faithful who turned up for a piece of football history, Erik Tan, 47, said he will keep the grass at home for precious memory by re-planting the turf in his yard

                Former Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou visits an exhibition on how China fought against COVID-19, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in handout picture released on Mar 30, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ma arrived in China on Monday, the first time a former or sitting Taiwanese president has visited the country since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The two sides must maintain exchanges, cooperate together, and do everything possible to avoid war and conflict." China's official Xinhua news agency cited Song as telling Ma that people in China and Taiwan should both "resolutely oppose Taiwan independence separatist activities and interference from external forces, and jointly safeguard the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ma is visiting China at a time of heightened tension between Taipei and Beijing, as China ramps up military and diplomatic pressure to try and force the democratically governed island to accept Chinese sovereignty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She has repeatedly offered talks with China but been rebuffed, as Beijing views her as a separatist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, which Ma is a senior member of, says it is vital to speak to China to try and lessen tensions.

                If you've ever been interested in what's called "bucket strategy," you're in luck – Morningstar has put together three specific examples of bucket strategy for you to check out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you plan for retirement and manage your portfolio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bucket Strategy Basics If you're not familiar with bucket strategy, it calls for structuring your retirement assets in three buckets based on longevity and when cash is needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first bucket holds your cash, cash equivalents and other liquid assets designed to be used in the first years of retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line The bucket strategy is an intuitive and relatively straightforward approach for spreading your assets across cash, bonds and stocks in retirement

                If you've ever been interested in what's called "bucket strategy," you're in luck – Morningstar has put together three specific examples of bucket strategy for you to check out

                A financial advisor can help you plan for retirement and manage your portfolio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bucket Strategy Basics If you're not familiar with bucket strategy, it calls for structuring your retirement assets in three buckets based on longevity and when cash is needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first bucket holds your cash, cash equivalents and other liquid assets designed to be used in the first years of retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line The bucket strategy is an intuitive and relatively straightforward approach for spreading your assets across cash, bonds and stocks in retirement

                Of this amount, domestic debts totalled RM1,050.1 billion while offshore loans amounted to RM29.5 billion

            <p>
                If the government’s exposure to other liabilities were to be taken into consideration, the federal government’s total debt and liabilities at end-2022 would be RM1.45 trillion, or 80.9 per cent of GDP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This amount includes federal government debt (RM1,079.6 billion), guaranteed commitments (RM205.9 billion), 1MDB (RM18.2 billion), and other liabilities (RM142.2 billion)

            <p>
                Despite the revelation, the Fed Funds Futures Curve, a market-based gauge of what the Fed will do at future meetings, has only increased the chances of rate hike in May to 45% from 43% previously

                A lower-than-expected result will indicate the labour market is still strong and encourage the Fed to continue raising rates to combat inflation.  Gross Domestic Product Annualized (Q4) will provide a perspective on general economic growth that could also effect Fed rate hike expectations, the US Dollar and Gold price

            <p>

            <p>
                A lower-than-expected result will indicate the labour market is still strong and encourage the Fed to continue raising rates to combat inflation.  Gross Domestic Product Annualized (Q4) will provide a perspective on general economic growth that could also effect Fed rate hike expectations, the US Dollar and Gold price

                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa (pic) said this was to deal with the workload that exceeded the capacity of available resources, as well as to reduce the burden of the pension scheme borne by the country at the moment, which amounted to RM29.1bil in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "So, the way out is to absorb contract workers on a permanent basis, but without a pension, yet they enjoy the same benefits as other permanent workers, like eligible for housing loan," she said during the question and answer session in the Dewan Negara on Thursday (March 30)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was responding to a supplementary question from Datuk Jefridin Atan who wanted to know whether the Health Ministry was considering employing more contract doctors to overcome the workload of health workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Dr Zaliha said due to the increase in cases of non-communicable diseases (NCD) cases, the ministry was facing an increase in the number of in- and out-patients in health facilities, causing overcrowding in hospitals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The Health Ministry is also intensifying its digitalisation efforts to reduce the workload of MoH members, in addition to implementing scheduling practices that can help ensure members have sufficient rest time between shifts, including giving leave to health workers," she said

                China’s long-term battle to reduce the dollar’s dominance in world trade took two steps forward this week, with the first LNG trade in yuan, plus Brazil agreeing to trade via local currencies   China’s long-term battle to reduce the power and reach of US dollar hegemony took two steps forward this week

                The central bank said that a move to re-peg the ringgit to the US dollar would force the country to impose capital controls on financial flows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a boxed article accompanying its annual report for 2022, the central bank said that a move to re-peg the ringgit to the US dollar would force the country to impose capital controls on financial flows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Without capital controls, such an exchange rate regime would require the overnight policy rate (OPR) to match the rise in the interest rate of the country to which the ringgit is pegged

            <p>
                “This being the US dollar, the OPR would need to be raised by 475 basis points (more than four times higher than the cumulative 100-basis-point hike) to match the rise in the federal funds rate

            <p>
                According to Bank Negara, a 5% change in the ringgit-US dollar exchange rate is associated with a 0.2 percentage point change in core inflation over a year

                Bank Negara acknowledged that under a flexible exchange rate regime, large swings in the exchange rate within a very short time would exacerbate uncertainties and cause individuals and firms to delay their decisions to consume and invest

                Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said yesterday when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 or the national budget for the second reading in the Dewan Negara that the new initiatives include expanding the Hari Raya Aidilfitri assistance, a two-year extension of individual tax relief for the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN), and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said the increase is the biggest aid the government has ever given to fishermen, padi farmers and rubber smallholders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Budget 2023, tabled on Feb 24, the government announced the Special Aidilfitri Assistance of RM300 per month for fishermen and RM200 per month for padi farmers for a period of three months per season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for SSPN until 2024.“This was decided after hearing public concerns and complaints made to the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister also announced that, effective April 1, this year, the government will expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to those with fixed and fluctuating monthly incomes who want to own their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said the government would also prioritise filling public service positions in critical sectors, especially health and education, and this is expected to involve an additional expenditure of up to RM800mil this year

                As a sellable asset, however, cashing in on the Brazilian could well be an option available to Klopp if he wishes to free up further funds and decides that Liverpool has seen the best of the 29-year-old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either as a cut-price alternative to the aforementioned Bellingham or as a fresh option at the base of midfield, the potential signing of the 85-time international could prove astute for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given Brozović's invaluable experience and potential availability, the Croatian could be an ideal addition and free up funds in other areas during what is likely to be a busy summer at Anfield.

                Liverpool have heavily been linked with Jude Bellingham ahead of a potential summer move this summer but Jürgen Klopp could also do with more experience in midfield

            <p>
                As a sellable asset, however, cashing in on the Brazilian could well be an option available to Klopp if he wishes to free up further funds and decides that Liverpool has seen the best of the 29-year-old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either as a cut-price alternative to the aforementioned Bellingham or as a fresh option at the base of midfield, the potential signing of the 85-time international could prove astute for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given Brozović's invaluable experience and potential availability, the Croatian could be an ideal addition and free up funds in other areas during what is likely to be a busy summer at Anfield.

                China consumes over half of the world’s chips as a global manufacturing hub, but US companies are market leaders in chip activities that are most research-intensive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The concern was not only China’s tech rise, but the pace at which China’s tech rise was taking place

            <p>
                China’s chip purchases, meanwhile, have enabled Taiwanese and South Korean companies “selling at the doorsteps of China” to become the largest in the world, Wang added

                China consumes over half of the world’s chips as a global manufacturing hub, but US companies are market leaders in chip activities that are most research-intensive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The concern was not only China’s tech rise, but the pace at which China’s tech rise was taking place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And at the same time, the US-China strategic rivalry was intensifying,” he noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the USA also knows that China doesn’t have many other options to respond to this.” Currently, China consumes more than 50 per cent of global chips as the manufacturing hub of the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China has also condemned the provision in the US’ Chips Act that prevents American tech companies that receive funding from expanding their advanced chip manufacturing in China for 10 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China’s chip purchases, meanwhile, have enabled Taiwanese and South Korean companies “selling at the doorsteps of China” to become the largest in the world, Wang added

                We are urgently seeking further clarification from FIFA as to the details of the extension and its variance from the FIGC sanction." Spurs added that when Paratici conducted an interview on club channels on Tuesday, "neither he nor the Club had any indication of this decision being made by FIFA, based on the fact the the FIGC sanction was taken on 20 January 2023 and remains subject to an Appeal on 19 April 2023."

                After playing every minute of England's two Euro qualifiers during the international break, Harry Maguire will face a familiar situation when he returns to Manchester United ahead of their trip to Newcastle United this weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I've played nearly 200 times for Manchester United and I've captained the club for three years." Maguire lifted his first trophy as United captain in February after a 2-0 win over Newcastle, but it was shared with stand-in skipper Bruno Fernandes after Maguire was only asked to play the final two minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag decided to keep Maguire as captain last summer, but made a point to his squad that no player was guaranteed a place in the team and that everyone would be judged on form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because Ten Hag wants a right-footed player paired with a left-footed player in the centre of defence, Maguire has been competing for one place with Varane and hasn't done enough to dislodge the Frenchman since he was dropped for United's 2-1 win over Liverpool in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Maguire did decide to find a new club this summer, what options does he have? There was interest from West Ham in January, but the England defender decided to stay and fight for his place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United need to sell to boost the summer transfer budget, and it's likely any reasonable offer for Maguire will be considered, particularly if Ten Hag firms up his interest in Ajax's Jurrien Timber
