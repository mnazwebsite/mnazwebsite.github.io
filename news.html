                Fred's goal with 14 minutes to play came just three minutes after United had opened the scoring through Anthony Martial who had recently come off the bench as United strolled to an overall 5-0 aggregate win in the semi-final clash

                The pair's careers did briefly overlap with the Portugal team between 2017 and 2018.  Bruno Fernandes (left) played a skillful assist to set up Fred (with Marcus Rashford, far right) for Manchester United's second goal in their 2-0 Carabao Cup victory over Nottingham Forest Fernandes (right) celebrates a Portugal goal with Ricardo Quaresma (second left) in 2018 Quaresma had a short spell on loan at Chelsea in 2009 but only played five times Quaresma had a good friendship with Cristiano Ronaldo as together they won Euro 2016 'I learned from Quaresma so I had a great professor in Portugal so you have to learn with the players

                It represents a first chance for the Portugal star to win his first trophy with United, who are on a trophy drought stretching back to 2017 when they lifted the Europa League under Jose Mourinho

                As Europe battles a cost-of-living crisis, Britain’s umbrella labour organisation the Trades Union Congress (TUC) called it the “biggest day of strike action since 2011”

                Ibrahima Konaté's injury is a reminder that Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp has been denied a key luxury enjoyed by Arsenal and Newcastle so far this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even when you apply criteria as broad as this, there are only two Premier League matches this season where you could genuinely make the case that Klopp has been able to field his best team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was the first game of the season against Fulham, when Matip started alongside Van Dijk, Henderson captained the side and Firmino and Díaz joined Salah in the forward line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On one level, this offers us mitigation for Liverpool's collapse this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unlike Arsenal and Newcastle, Liverpool hasn't been able to reap the benefits of a settled side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even if it had enjoyed the same luxuries as Newcastle, Liverpool might have still have been outside the top four

                Ibrahima Konaté's injury is a reminder that Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp has been denied a key luxury enjoyed by Arsenal and Newcastle so far this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even when you apply criteria as broad as this, there are only two Premier League matches this season where you could genuinely make the case that Klopp has been able to field his best team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was the first game of the season against Fulham, when Matip started alongside Van Dijk, Henderson captained the side and Firmino and Díaz joined Salah in the forward line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On one level, this offers us mitigation for Liverpool's collapse this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unlike Arsenal and Newcastle, Liverpool hasn't been able to reap the benefits of a settled side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even if it had enjoyed the same luxuries as Newcastle, Liverpool might have still have been outside the top four

                'No one believed he was one of ours.' Enzo Fernandez joined Chelsea in a British record £107million transfer from Benfica Fernandez is the latest star arrival at Chelsea following a January of heavy spending by the club Even during his boyhood years in his home nation of Argentina Fernandez was in-demand There is a River Plate shirt signed by Fernandez proudly displayed on the club wall

            <p>
                Fernandez (red) has the ability to become Chelsea's newest midfield leader after joining from Benfica Fernandez won the World Cup with Argentina alongside national hero Lionel Messi in Qatar 'Make sure you shoot, you'll score,' Pablo Esquivel, who had discovered five-year-old Enzo at La Recova, told him in a text message on the eve of that Mexico game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Messi who played him in and Fernandez's goal made him the youngest player (21 years and 313 days) since Messi (18 years and 257 days) to score in a World Cup group game for his country

            <p>
                By then Fernandez will be a year into life in west London and Chelsea will know if, as it was for La Recova, it is always worth doing whatever it takes to have him on your side.

            <p>
                Determining How Much You Have You may think that you have $1.5 million for retirement, but a closer inspection of your assets and income streams may make you realize you have more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taking a thorough inventory can help you determine not only how long $1.5 million will last, but how much you can reasonably spend each year.  Retirement Assets  In addition to your $1.5 million, you may have other assets that can be used to supplement your income at a later date or will be included in your estate for your heirs

            <p>
                Time is every investor's friend.  Here's how fast you would run out of money with each portfolio type, assuming you have a $1.5 million portfolio and withdrew $60,000 annually, taking out 3.8% more every year for inflation, which is the historical average annual inflation rate since 1960.  Cash Portfolio Withdrawing $60,000 annually from a $1.5 million portfolio kept in cash would cause you to run out of money in 18 years

            <p>
                Working with a financial advisor can help you determine the right way to invest your portfolio for long-term stability.  The Bottom Line How long $1.5 million will last in retirement depends foremost on how quickly you spend money

                Rayo Vallecano president Raul Martin Presa has confirmed that left-back Fran Garcia will join Real Madrid this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Garcia, 23, was a highly rated Madrid youth product who left for Rayo in July 2021, where he has excelled and become one of LaLiga's top attacking full-backs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We've reached an agreement with Madrid," Martin Presa told Cadena COPE radio on Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Fran Garcia will go at the end of the [season]
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But we spoke to them and out of respect to Rayo, to not hurt Rayo, they've behaved like gentlemen." Madrid left-back Mendy suffered a hamstring injury in their Copa del Rey win over Atletico Madrid last Thursday, and midfielder Eduardo Camavinga has since deputised in the position
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                A box-to-box midfielder by trade, Sabitzer is most likely set to slot in as Eriksen’s direct replacement alongside Casemiro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That would allow United to keep their most tried-and-trusted shape under Ten Hag

                NOTTINGHAM FOREST have confirmed THREE deadline day signings in Felipe, Jonjo Shelvey and Keylor Navas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Tricky Trees brought in a remarkable 23 new players during the summer window ahead of their first season back in the Premier League for more than two decades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shelvey, 30, was the next man to be confirmed by the club as he swapped Newcastle for Nottingham - signing a contract until 2025
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "You can see it’s a club looking to really grow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I previously knew of him from my time at Liverpool, so I knew what a fantastic coach he was, but meeting him for the first time has been a breath of fresh air
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He’s told me what he expects and the high standards he sets, so I can hope I can come and help the team push to stay in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Forest's most decorated deadline day signing was undoubtedly keeper Navas

                NOTTINGHAM FOREST have confirmed THREE deadline day signings in Felipe, Jonjo Shelvey and Keylor Navas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Tricky Trees brought in a remarkable 23 new players during the summer window ahead of their first season back in the Premier League for more than two decades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shelvey, 30, was the next man to be confirmed by the club as he swapped Newcastle for Nottingham - signing a contract until 2025
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "You can see it’s a club looking to really grow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I previously knew of him from my time at Liverpool, so I knew what a fantastic coach he was, but meeting him for the first time has been a breath of fresh air
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He’s told me what he expects and the high standards he sets, so I can hope I can come and help the team push to stay in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Forest's most decorated deadline day signing was undoubtedly keeper Navas

                Members of the Incident Management Team coordinate the search for a radioactive capsule that was lost in transit by a contractor hired by Rio Tinto, at the Emergency Services Complex in Cockburn, Australia, in this undated handout photo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Caesium-137 capsule lost in transit more than two weeks ago was discovered when a vehicle travelling at 70 km per hour (43 mph) equipped with specialist detection equipment picked up the radiation, according to officials from the state of Western Australia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The search team then used portable detection equipment to find the capsule, which was located about 2 metres from the side of the road in a remote area far from any community, they added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The radioactive capsule was part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed from Rio Tinto's  Gudai-Darri mine in the state's remote Kimberley region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK' Western Australia's Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said the find was an "extraordinary result" after a search involving the state's emergency response department, defence authorities and radiation specialists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Western Australia's Chief Health Officer Andrew Robertson said there would be an investigation and prosecutions would be considered under state radiation safety laws from 1975

                The Caesium-137 capsule lost in transit more than two weeks ago was discovered when a vehicle travelling at 70 km per hour (43 mph) equipped with specialist detection equipment picked up the radiation, according to officials from the state of Western Australia

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 1 — TikTok star Callum Ryan set himself up for his coolest challenge yet — to fly to Italy and buy a pizza for cheaper than the price of a UK Domino’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Upon arrival in Milan, he used TikTok to find the best place for pizza and headed straight there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As soon as he was seated, he was served a free glass of prosecco and a piece of what he described as a pizza pesto thing that he concluded was, “Quite nice.” He then ordered a Margherita pizza and also a beer which didn’t count as it was an optional extra
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After finishing the pizza that he said looked beautiful, it was time to pay for the bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pizza on its own was €8.50 and the table service was €2.50, which meant a total of €11, which converted into £9.72 (RM52)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adding to that the price of the £8 flight ticket, it means he paid just £17.72 (RM 94) — cheaper than a UK medium Domino’s pizza which costs £19.99 (RM106)

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 1 — TikTok star Callum Ryan set himself up for his coolest challenge yet — to fly to Italy and buy a pizza for cheaper than the price of a UK Domino’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Upon arrival in Milan, he used TikTok to find the best place for pizza and headed straight there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As soon as he was seated, he was served a free glass of prosecco and a piece of what he described as a pizza pesto thing that he concluded was, “Quite nice.” He then ordered a Margherita pizza and also a beer which didn’t count as it was an optional extra
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After finishing the pizza that he said looked beautiful, it was time to pay for the bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pizza on its own was €8.50 and the table service was €2.50, which meant a total of €11, which converted into £9.72 (RM52)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adding to that the price of the £8 flight ticket, it means he paid just £17.72 (RM 94) — cheaper than a UK medium Domino’s pizza which costs £19.99 (RM106)

                Porsche said it had been in touch with the first person who made an online reservation and “negotiated an agreeable outcome” regarding the one vehicle the dealership had in stock

                Porsche contacted all of the other bidders individually to explain the situation and apologise, and will refund reservation fees within 48 hours, the spokeswoman said

                New home prices rose month-on-month in 12 cities, up from 10 in December, according to the survey by China Index Academy (CIA), one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms

                China's property sector, accounting for a quarter of the economy, has struggled with defaults and stalled projects, hitting market confidence and weighing on economic growth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The survey also showed six cities, notably the Chinese capital Beijing and the populous city of Chengdu in southwest China, reversed declines to post growth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More broadly, prices in 100 cities monitored by the research firm fell 0.02 per cent from a month earlier in January compared with the bigger 0.08 per cent drop in December and marking the fourth straight month of narrowing declines

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 1 — Several political analysts have weighed in on the “Malaysia Madani” concept launched by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim earlier last month, and whether it can be a useful guide for a new national narrative

                Since February 2021, humanitarian groups have found it difficult to assess the security situation on the ground, while many of their partners have exited Myanmar

            <p>
                According to the United Nations, more than 1.4 million people have also been internally displaced since the coup, and the future of Myanmar’s 54 million people remains uncertain.  Myanmar was already one of Southeast Asia’s poorest countries prior to the coup

            <p>
                Many humanitarian groups in Indonesia, the country with the world’s largest Muslim population, had been involved in helping people in Myanmar.  Among them is Jakarta-based Dompet Dhuafa, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that used to regularly send humanitarian aid to Myanmar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From 2015 until the coup took place, it ran regular programmes such as those for Iftar, which means breaking the fast during Ramadan, for Myanmar Muslims.  "Dompet Dhuafa sent assistance to Myanmar several times and created regular programmes such as the Ramadan programme Iftar in exile and for Myanmar Muslims.  “This was done regularly from 2015 until the coup and we also gave other humanitarian emergency assistance,” he said

                Indonesian non-governmental organisation Dompet Dhuafa sent humanitarian assistance to Myanmar from 2015 until the 2021 coup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the United Nations, more than 1.4 million people have also been internally displaced since the coup, and the future of Myanmar’s 54 million people remains uncertain.  Myanmar was already one of Southeast Asia’s poorest countries prior to the coup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many humanitarian groups in Indonesia, the country with the world’s largest Muslim population, had been involved in helping people in Myanmar.  Among them is Jakarta-based Dompet Dhuafa, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that used to regularly send humanitarian aid to Myanmar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From 2015 until the coup took place, it ran regular programmes such as those for Iftar, which means breaking the fast during Ramadan, for Myanmar Muslims.  "Dompet Dhuafa sent assistance to Myanmar several times and created regular programmes such as the Ramadan programme Iftar in exile and for Myanmar Muslims.  “This was done regularly from 2015 until the coup and we also gave other humanitarian emergency assistance,” he said

            <p>
                Full-year profit of $55.7 billion far exceeded Exxon’s prior record of $45.2 billion in 2008, which at the time marked the biggest in US corporate history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Exxon’s outperformance was in marked contrast to US rival Chevron Corp., which last week posted a surprise earnings miss last week just days after announcing a mammoth $75 billion share-buyback program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Exxon expanded buybacks multiple times last year and already has signaled its intention to repurchase $50 billion of stock through 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A slowdown in Chevron’s Permian Basin annual growth to 10% probably will be an “overhang” on the stock, Cowen & Co

            <p>
                Full-year profit of $55.7 billion far exceeded Exxon’s prior record of $45.2 billion in 2008, which at the time marked the biggest in US corporate history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Exxon’s outperformance was in marked contrast to US rival Chevron Corp., which last week posted a surprise earnings miss last week just days after announcing a mammoth $75 billion share-buyback program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Exxon expanded buybacks multiple times last year and already has signaled its intention to repurchase $50 billion of stock through 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A slowdown in Chevron’s Permian Basin annual growth to 10% probably will be an “overhang” on the stock, Cowen & Co

                Doherty is Atletico's preferred choice ahead of Roma's Rick Karsdorp, with sources telling ESPN the relationship between Atletico and Spurs allowed for a deal to be reached quickly ahead of the January transfer deadline

                About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, Jan 31 — It is “shameful” of the “political bandits” who had recently tried to attempt a coup against Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor to now ask to be part of the new government, said Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) president Datuk Seri Maximus Ongkili
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili, whose PBS is part of the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) ruling coalition, described the three parties — Umno, Parti Warisan and Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Masyarakat (PKDM) — as “power-hungry political bandits” who had created the “disturbance” for their own political gain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Isn’t it a shameful political ploy that after failing to dislodge the chief minister and his government, you suddenly want to be invited to be part of the government?” he asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili, who was the former minister for Sabah and Sarawak affairs, said that he hoped the “cooling off period” called by Umno president and deputy prime minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is welcomed to strengthen political unity and solidarity in the state

                According to Perodua president and CEO Datuk Zainal Abidin Ahmad, the increase in the new Axia’s price is because of the larger vehicle size as well as the inclusion of more advanced features compared to its predecessor

            <p>
                “For new prices, like our Axia, the size of this model has increased compared to the current (car)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, the Axia was basic and didn’t have ASA (Advanced Safety Assist)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Safety is very important

            <p>
                “So, with the increased specifications, the increase in safety, the pricing will be different from before

            <p>
                Only the GXtra onwards came with Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and traction control, but the new Axia will have VSC, traction control and hill start assist as standard across the range

                Muhammad Mohan, the chairman of the local chapter TI-Malaysia, said despite an increase in the ranking to 61st out of 108 countries compared to 62nd previously, Malaysia’s score continued to fall after reaching its height of 53 points in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have to turn around this downward trend,” he told reporters when presenting the 2022 Malaysia CPI report here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad said among the nine surveys that determine the CPI score, Malaysia had dropped significant points in the 2022 World Economic Forum executive opinion survey from 54 to 47 points, while dropping from 48 to 45 points in the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index Expert Survey for the same period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also lauded the new Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim government's commitment to good governance, fighting corruption and judicial independence, mandatory competitive bidding for procurement contracts and review of certain high-value projects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s good but this is basic, I'm very surprised the previous ministers don’t even look at the report,” he said, referring to Anwar

            <p>
                Denmark placed first with a score of 90, followed by New Zealand and Finland with 87

                He was responding to claims by Goldman that Malaysia had "undervalued" the assets already retrieved, as part of its recovery from the scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Anwar, the 1MDB scandal is a "crime" committed not only against him, or the Malaysian government, but against all "Malaysians." He urged Goldman to "come clean" and settle the deal with Malaysia as 1MDB was a scandal known throughout the world, and not just dismiss it by flexing the firm's financial muscle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goldman raised US$6.5 billion (RM27.6 billion) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion (RM12.3 billion) and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge, to settle probes into the looting of billions of dollars from 1MDB and payment of bribes to win business for the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To a claim by Goldman that Malaysia was intentionally undervaluing the assets to force Goldman to pay a US$250 million interim payment, Anwar said that under a "fair deal", Malaysia was supposed to have been paid much more than that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How much we can get, I frankly can't say for now, but it's much more than we should be able to do (sic)," he said, urging governments around the world to act more "responsibly" to assist the asset recovery.

                He was responding to claims by Goldman that Malaysia had "undervalued" the assets already retrieved, as part of its recovery from the scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Anwar, the 1MDB scandal is a "crime" committed not only against him, or the Malaysian government, but against all "Malaysians." He urged Goldman to "come clean" and settle the deal with Malaysia as 1MDB was a scandal known throughout the world, and not just dismiss it by flexing the firm's financial muscle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goldman raised US$6.5 billion (RM27.6 billion) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion (RM12.3 billion) and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge, to settle probes into the looting of billions of dollars from 1MDB and payment of bribes to win business for the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To a claim by Goldman that Malaysia was intentionally undervaluing the assets to force Goldman to pay a US$250 million interim payment, Anwar said that under a "fair deal", Malaysia was supposed to have been paid much more than that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How much we can get, I frankly can't say for now, but it's much more than we should be able to do (sic)," he said, urging governments around the world to act more "responsibly" to assist the asset recovery.

                Khairy also told CNA that he felt it would be difficult for Umno to return from its present state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I believe it will be hard for Umno to come back from this and not because they dismissed me, but because the entire trajectory of Umno is downwards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Umno now only has 26 parliamentary seats and they are still reluctant to reform,” he reportedly said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Khairy said that there was a possibility that he will return to Umno one day, but added that the party needs to be a significantly different party before he considers rejoining it

                Mohd Hatta Sanuri, who filed the suit through Messrs Mohaji, Hazury & Ismail on Dec 30 last year, also named former Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Economy) Mustapa Mohamed, former transport minister Wee Ka Siong and the government as the three other defendants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the statement of claim, Mohd Hatta said Dr Mahathir, who was then prime minister, had committed tort misfeasance in public office when he decided to postpone the HSR project, causing the government and the Malaysian people to pay compensation of almost RM46 million (S$14.2 million) to the Singapore Government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that Muhyiddin also committed tort misfeasance in public office for terminating the project when he was prime minister, causing the Malaysian government and the people to pay RM320.3 million as compensation for the cancellation of the bilateral agreement between Malaysia and Singapore.  Mohd Hatta also claimed that Mustapha, who was responsible for managing the project, had committed a similar offence by shelving the project, while Wee committed tort misfeasance in public office for denying Malaysians their right to enjoy a first-class transport system

            <p>
                On Jan 1, 2021, Malaysia and Singapore announced the termination of the 350km HSR project as the two countries failed to reach an agreement on changes proposed by Malaysia before the expiry of the project agreement on Dec 31, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Last Friday, Rapid Rail Sdn Bhd stopped trains from passing the station after the tracks became bent following movements in the concrete segment supporting the rail

                A visual examination of the pier, sandwiched between a DBKL office block and the Gombak river, found that cracks had developed at the upper part of the pier that holds up the concrete segment that in turn supports the rail

            <p>
                The single biggest stock market loss came from the fund's stake in Amazon (AMZN.O), which declined in value by 56 billion crowns, followed by a loss in shares of Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) of 52 billion and in Tesla (TSLA.O) with 47 billion

            <p>
                Still, despite the record loss, the value of the fund rose overall by 89 billion crowns or $8.9 billion year-on-year, partly due to the weak Norwegian currency and a record 1.1 trillion crowns of cash inflows

                The previous largest loss was 633 billion crowns in 2008

            <p>
                There is just nowhere to hide," fund Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen told a news conference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The single biggest stock market loss came from the fund's stake in Amazon (AMZN.O), which declined in value by 56 billion crowns, followed by a loss in shares of Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) of 52 billion and in Tesla (TSLA.O) with 47 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, despite the record loss, the value of the fund rose overall by 89 billion crowns or $8.9 billion year-on-year, partly due to the weak Norwegian currency and a record 1.1 trillion crowns of cash inflows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fund invests the Norwegian state's revenues from petroleum production
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "And then of course we have still geopolitical hotspots." The fund's return on investment in 2022 stood at minus 14.1% for the year, which was 0.88 percentage point better than the return on the fund's benchmark index

                Michael Gunson is hoping to get home earlier than 9 February after his flight was cancelled.

                Aucklander Michael Gunson was booked to travel on the same cancelled Malaysia Airlines flight as the Cocker family

                Speaking at the 2021 National Sports Awards ceremony here on Tuesday (Jan 31), Anwar related his discussion with Alex Ferguson during a meeting that was made possible by former United States vice president Al Gore in New York some time ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Alex Ferguson said as a leader, we must express our love and respect to those who are in the team and from there, we can mould a team that will be tightly knit although they come from different backgrounds and places," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar added that Ferguson's concern in safeguarding the values and welfare of the players should be exemplary and should be replicated by managers and administrators of sports in Malaysia so as to build strong values among athletes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said success in sports cannot be achieved if the welfare of athletes is ignored

                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking at the 2021 National Sports Awards ceremony here on Tuesday (Jan 31), Anwar related his discussion with Alex Ferguson during a meeting that was made possible by former United States vice president Al Gore in New York some time ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Alex Ferguson said as a leader, we must express our love and respect to those who are in the team and from there, we can mould a team that will be tightly knit although they come from different backgrounds and places," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar added that Ferguson's concern in safeguarding the values and welfare of the players should be exemplary and should be replicated by managers and administrators of sports in Malaysia so as to build strong values among athletes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said success in sports cannot be achieved if the welfare of athletes is ignored
            </p>

                Even if you love your career, you probably spend more time than you’d be willing to admit fantasizing about retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And whether you’re diligent about your savings goals or feeling behind on them, preparing for retirement isn’t just a financial endeavor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These rituals and routines can lead to happiness in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether you’re 10 years from retirement or right on its doorstep, you might be tempted to put your assets on cruise control
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But young or old, it’s still prudent to keep a sharp eye on your investments and income flow, and to stay atop any government rule changes or other situations that could change how much you receive (along with any new taxes you may owe) in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Keep it up, because paying attention to your health now can pay off in retirement, quite literally

            <p>
                Even if you love your career, you probably spend more time than you’d be willing to admit fantasizing about retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And whether you’re diligent about your savings goals or feeling behind on them, preparing for retirement isn’t just a financial endeavor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These rituals and routines can lead to happiness in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether you’re 10 years from retirement or right on its doorstep, you might be tempted to put your assets on cruise control
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But young or old, it’s still prudent to keep a sharp eye on your investments and income flow, and to stay atop any government rule changes or other situations that could change how much you receive (along with any new taxes you may owe) in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Keep it up, because paying attention to your health now can pay off in retirement, quite literally

                Malaysia had raised the debt limit to 60% of gross domestic product from 55% in 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, and lifted it further to 65% in 2021 to make room for additional borrowings to fund fiscal stimulus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s actual debt is at 61% of GDP, and the law under which the ceiling was raised lapsed on Dec 31
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Malaysia remains A-rated by credit agencies Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, a reduction in government debt ratio will be key to winning a higher credit score from Fitch Ratings Ltd, which is currently the only one of the three main rating companies to have a lower BBB+ rating on the South-East Asian nation

                Anwar, who doubles as Finance Minister, is set to table the revised 2023 Budget to Parliament on Feb 24 and has been preaching fiscal prudence as the South-East Asian nation stares down still-elevated debt levels in the wake of a Covid-era spending drive

            <p>
                Earlier this month, Anwar had warned that this year’s fiscal position won’t be comfortable, with about RM1.5 trillion in total debt and liabilities and a budget deficit setting around 5.8% of gross domestic product as of last year

                Its president Karen Cheah said another lead counsel could be appointed by the Attorney General to replace the late Sri Ram in the trial

            <p>
                lead counsel (may come) from within the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) or Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) officers to continue with the cases,” said Cheah when contacted on Monday (Jan 30)

            <p>
                Asked if there was a deadline to appoint a new lead prosecutor, Khoo said it needed to be done reasonably soon, so as not to delay the trial

                Sri Ram’s wake and cremation ceremony would be held on Tuesday (Jan 31)

                Hazland said Singapore requires more energy supply for its industries and companies and Sarawak via SEB,could provide the republic island with green and renewable energy generated by its major hydroelectric dams

                Bakun dam, which was then held by Federal government-owned Sarawak Hidro Sdn Bhd, was acquired by SEB in 2017

                Saying that selling energy to Singapore will bring huge benefits to Sarawak, Hazland said Sarawak’s plan to export electricity to Singapore is also in line with its big plan to connect countries through the Asean Grid

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! The Bad Stefan Bajčetić and Naby Keïta have helped the Liverpool midfield considerably since coming into the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But even that in itself is an issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bajčetić is undoubtedly the best option as the deepest-lying midfielder that Liverpool has available at the moment, while Keïta set up the goal and won four out of seven duels in 59 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Right now, Liverpool is reliant on Bajčetić and Keïta staying fit (as well as Thiago Alcântara, with a patchy injury record of his own), and even when available, they cannot play every minute of every game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That, though, was just the start

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! The Bad Stefan Bajčetić and Naby Keïta have helped the Liverpool midfield considerably since coming into the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But even that in itself is an issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bajčetić is undoubtedly the best option as the deepest-lying midfielder that Liverpool has available at the moment, while Keïta set up the goal and won four out of seven duels in 59 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Right now, Liverpool is reliant on Bajčetić and Keïta staying fit (as well as Thiago Alcântara, with a patchy injury record of his own), and even when available, they cannot play every minute of every game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That, though, was just the start
            </p>

                Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Aziz at the Shopee headquarters in Singapore on Jan 29, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shopee is the largest pan-regional e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan.  Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tengku Zafrul Aziz announced this move during his official visit to the company’s headquarters in Singapore on Sunday (Jan 29).  Sea's decision to expand its investment footprint in Malaysia reflects the company’s confidence in the prospects, as well as the operational and policy stability of the country’s business landscape, he added.  During the minister's visit, Sea shared its proposed expansion plans in Malaysia, involving the setting up of cloud computing services, data hosting and processing, as well as a new logistics e-commerce warehouse.  The cloud computing project will be located in a three-storey green facility in the Johor town of Kulai, said Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This includes local sourcing, vendor development and the strengthening of the local industrial ecosystem, particularly in the digital space," said Tengku Zafrul.  Tengku Zafrul's three-day investment mission to Singapore is in conjunction with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s first official visit to the country on Monday.  During the visit, he will also have one-on-one business meetings with the Yondr Group, a global leader in data centres and INSEACT, a Singapore-based alternative protein company which specialises in producing sustainable insect protein for aquaculture.  Sea's co-founder and group chief operating officer, Gang Ye said the decision was a significant development not just for the group, but also for the local digital ecosystem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sea has also laid off more than 7,000 employees - or about 10 per cent of its workforce - as of December last year.  Staff cuts were also made at Garena in September 2022, including the shutting down some major projects to boost Sea's profitability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That same month, more Shopee employees were also laid off, with some of them having their job offers rescinded days before they began work.

                Azalina said the court found such conduct by the alleged Sulu heirs to amount to a "manifestly illicit hardship" that is detrimental to Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak in 2010 declared Stampa as having no jurisdiction over Malaysia and ordered a stop to the continued arbitrations in Spain, Stampa and the Sulu claimants ignored a Spanish court's decision to cancel his appointment and shifted the entire arbitration to France

            <p>
                Ignoring the Spanish and French courts' decisions which meant the arbitration was illegitimate, Stampa on February 28, 2022, gave his arbitration decision — also known as the "final award" — to order Malaysia to pay US$14.92 billion to the eight Sulu claimants

                After the seizure order issued in July 2022, Azalina said Malaysia had immediately applied to the District Court of Luxembourg to obtain an interim relief to release or set aside the seizure order known as "saisie arrêt"

                That’s down from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And people who remember the ridiculously high interest rates that followed the high inflation of the ’70s say buckle down and be prudent, because we’re in for a long haul

                By 1980, inflation was at 14.5% and unemployment hit 7%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The high interest rate made getting ahead almost impossible, says Mike Drak, who was a banker at the time

                He remembers his mortgage rate was 17.5% at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                And people who remember the ridiculously high interest rates that followed the high inflation of the ’70s say buckle down and be prudent, because we’re in for a long haul

                As inflated gas prices came down at the end of last years, the fuel cost for most Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles was comparatively cheaper in the final quarter of 2022 than charging an electric vehicle (EV), analysts with the Anderson Economic Group (AEG) said

            <p>
                AEG's cost analysis looked at the underlying cost of energy for gas, diesel and electricity, as well as road taxes and fees, added costs to operate pump or EV charger and the cost to drive to a fueling station

                EV DRIVERS STRUGGLE TO FIND CHARGING STATIONS AMERICANS STRUGGLING TO MAKE CAR PAYMENTS IS HIGHEST SINCE GREAT RECESSION READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP The analysis found that in Q4 2022, a typical mid-priced gas car driver paid about $11.29 to fuel their vehicle for 100 miles of driving
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That was about 31 cents cheaper than what a mid-priced electric car driver paid charging their vehicle at home, and more than $3 less than what comparable EV drivers pay when they charge their vehicles at a fuel station

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 29 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will undertake his first official visit to Singapore tomorrow (Jan 30) at the invitation of his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian Foreign Ministry (Wisma Putra), in a statement, said Anwar – in his maiden visit to the republic after being sworn in as the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia – will be meeting President Halimah Yacob and Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Prime Minister will also hold an engagement with the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore," said the statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement said the visit reflects the importance of the Malaysia-Singapore ties as close neighbours and partners in Asean
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar will be accompanied by his wife, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, and the delegation will comprise foreign affairs minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, Minister of Transport Anthony Loke Siew Fook, Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, Minister of Communications and Digital Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil, and officials from the relevant ministries and agencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Separately, Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said that Anwar’s visit to Singapore “underscores the close and enduring relationship between Singapore and Malaysia, and our peoples.” The ministry said Anwar will attend an official welcome ceremony at the Istana

                Mohamed Salah has struggled to produce his best form for Liverpool this season It's not just Saturday, since the World Cup or even this season that Salah has looked a little off form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This time Salah did take a spot-kick - but crucially he missed

            <p>
                The end result right now though is Salah's source for chances is not delivering the goods like it once did
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Granted, he isn't quite man-marked out of game given his modest goals record this season but Liverpool's often relatively ponderous attacking build up is detrimental to Salah's game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp's tactics this term have forced Salah out to the right and have limited the forward Salah's drop in form could also come from a factor that no footballer can beat..

            <p>
                Salah's run of four league games without goal contributions is his worst run for two years That's not to say Salah is finished - far from it

                Washington's allegations that North Korea has provided arms to Russia are a "baseless" effort to justify its own military aid to Ukraine, Kwon Chung-keun, director of US affairs at North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA

                US and South Korean officials have also warned the North could be preparing for its first test of a nuclear device since 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The White House said in December that North Korea completed an initial arms delivery of infantry rockets and missiles to a private Russian military company, the Wagner Group, to shore up Russian forces in Ukraine.

                Djokovic was the most emotional he had ever been after a title win as he finally won his 10th Australian Open crown and was able to match long-time rival Nadal's record of 22 Grand Slams with his win over Tsitsipas on Sunday

                Tsitsipas had a set point at 4-5 in the second set before losing a tiebreak and broke the Djokovic serve at the start of the third set

            <p>
                At 4-5, the Greek earned a break point but Djokovic won a superb 15-stroke rally with a fierce forehand winner after a fan had cried out during the point

            <p>
                The Serb then took a seven-minute toilet break - and was then broken for the first time following an audacious Tsitsipas drop shot on break point

            <p>
                But again the Greek was unable to raise his game in the tiebreak as Djokovic race to a 5-0 lead

                Tsitsipas had a set point at 4-5 in the second set before losing a tiebreak and broke the Djokovic serve at the start of the third set
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Djokovic, who lost only five points on his serve in the first set, took his first set point with a service winner after only 36 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At 4-5, the Greek earned a break point but Djokovic won a superb 15-stroke rally with a fierce forehand winner after a fan had cried out during the point
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Greek hit a backhand long on Djokovic’s first set point - his fifth unforced error of the tiebreak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Serb then took a seven-minute toilet break - and was then broken for the first time following an audacious Tsitsipas drop shot on break point
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But again the Greek was unable to raise his game in the tiebreak as Djokovic race to a 5-0 lead

                Man United defender Harry Maguire heaped special praise on Casemiro after their FA Cup win over Reading
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, Casemiro fired home a brilliant second, bending home a delicious effort from outside the penalty area, ahead of substitute Fred flicking the ball home from close range to make it 3-0
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In and out of possession he has really improved us." Victory over the Royals marked United's 11th successive win on their own patch, meaning you have to go back to the goalless draw with Newcastle United on October 16 for the last time they failed to win at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Man United defender Harry Maguire heaped special praise on Casemiro after their FA Cup win over Reading
            </p>

                First, Casemiro fired home a brilliant second, bending home a delicious effort from outside the penalty area, ahead of substitute Fred flicking the ball home from close range to make it 3-0
            </p>

                In and out of possession he has really improved us." Victory over the Royals marked United's 11th successive win on their own patch, meaning you have to go back to the goalless draw with Newcastle United on October 16 for the last time they failed to win at Old Trafford

                Japan's goals were scored by Kaito Tanaka (23rd minute) and Seren Tanaka (31st)

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 28 — The real threat to the survival of the ethnic Malay community and Malaysia as a whole is corruption as well as leaders who steal the country’s wealth, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar was countering politicians who harp on race and religion, saying these are irrelevant to good governance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's a way and attempt by political leaders to disguise and hijack the central issues of governance in this country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Now my answer to that question is, it is not being challenged by Malay businessmen or Chinese businessmen or Indian businessmen or Sabah, Sarawak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malay survival is being threatened by a corrupt system, a greedy coterie of leaders who have been stealing public funds from this country, so we will have to continue to work together to make sure we save this country from corruption,” he said in his keynote speech at the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia's (ACCCIM) Chinese New Year open house here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his speech, Anwar also alluded to ACCCIM president Tan Sri Low Kian Chuan’s earlier speech on issues of good governance and a firm commitment and determination to wipe out corruption which had become systemic and endemic in Malaysia

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 28 — The real threat to the survival of the ethnic Malay community and Malaysia as a whole is corruption as well as leaders who steal the country’s wealth, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar was countering politicians who harp on race and religion, saying these are irrelevant to good governance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's a way and attempt by political leaders to disguise and hijack the central issues of governance in this country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Now my answer to that question is, it is not being challenged by Malay businessmen or Chinese businessmen or Indian businessmen or Sabah, Sarawak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malay survival is being threatened by a corrupt system, a greedy coterie of leaders who have been stealing public funds from this country, so we will have to continue to work together to make sure we save this country from corruption,” he said in his keynote speech at the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia's (ACCCIM) Chinese New Year open house here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his speech, Anwar also alluded to ACCCIM president Tan Sri Low Kian Chuan’s earlier speech on issues of good governance and a firm commitment and determination to wipe out corruption which had become systemic and endemic in Malaysia
            </p>

                Indian billionaire Gautam Adani addresses delegates during the Bengal Global Business Summit in Kolkata, India on Apr 20, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani was born in Ahmedabad to a middle-class family but dropped out of school at 16 and moved to the financial capital Mumbai to find work in the lucrative gems trade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani is seen as an acolyte of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow Gujarat native, and has aligned his own business interests with those of "nation building"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani batted away press freedom fears, but told the Financial Times that journalists should have the "courage" to say "when the government is doing the right thing every day"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The issues now facing Adani's empire "strike at the heart" of India's corporate sector and the dominance of family-controlled firms, Global CIO Office chief executive Gary Dugan told Bloomberg on Friday

                Memphis police chief Cerelyn Davis said before the video's release that it showed behaviours on the part of police officers "that defy humanity"

                Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old black man who was pulled over while driving and died three days later, is detained by Memphis Police Department officers on Jan 7, 2023, in this screengrab from a video released by Memphis Police Department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The officers, all black, were dismissed from the police department last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The beatings appeared to continue far beyond a point where Nichols could pose any threat to police
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nichols is heard repeatedly screaming, "Mom! Mom!" as he struggles with officers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Memphis police chief Cerelyn Davis said before the video's release that it showed behaviours on the part of police officers "that defy humanity"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nichols' family and Biden appealed for calm in Memphis, a city of 628,000 where nearly 65 per cent of residents are black

                Manchester United's defence has gone from shambolic to steely - with Erik ten Hag's side amassing the joint-second most clean sheets in all of Europe this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His first match was slightly delayed after his arrival, but since he has come into the starting line-up, United haven't looked back

                LUKE SHAW STEPPING UP Most have been lauding the centre-back partnership of Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane, but just as important is left-back Luke Shaw
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Luke Shaw has not put a foot wrong since being re-called at either left-back or centre-back Even more bizarrely with England left-back Luke Shaw deployed as a centre-back, much to everyone's surprise - helping shut down Erling Haaland and Pep Guardiola's array of Man City stars in one of those matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has heaped praise on Shaw numerous times, but a stand-out moment was after the City win
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's been huge either at centre-half or left full-back

                Manchester United's defence has gone from shambolic to steely - with Erik ten Hag's side amassing the joint-second most clean sheets in all of Europe this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His first match was slightly delayed after his arrival, but since he has come into the starting line-up, United haven't looked back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LUKE SHAW STEPPING UP Most have been lauding the centre-back partnership of Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane, but just as important is left-back Luke Shaw
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Luke Shaw has not put a foot wrong since being re-called at either left-back or centre-back Even more bizarrely with England left-back Luke Shaw deployed as a centre-back, much to everyone's surprise - helping shut down Erling Haaland and Pep Guardiola's array of Man City stars in one of those matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has heaped praise on Shaw numerous times, but a stand-out moment was after the City win
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's been huge either at centre-half or left full-back

                The states of Johor, Pahang and Sabah have been hit by flooding amid continuous heavy rain brought about by the northeast monsoon.  Nearly 14,000 people in the three states were in temporary flood relief centres, Bernama reported on Saturday morning, but that number fell significantly by evening.  “I don’t think a flood emergency should be declared because it only involves certain states and districts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The state disaster management committees have taken proactive measures together with the district disaster management committees,” said Ahmad Zahid, who is also the chairman of the Central Disaster Management Committee

                “The aid provided has been given to all the heads of families and, at the same time, we have other matters that need to be carried out, including post-flood assistance,” he told a media conference after visiting a temporary relief centre in Mersing.  Ahmad Zahid, who is also the rural and regional development minister, added that the government will look into improving coordination among non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the relevant agencies involved in post-flood management

                Former FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces fraud charges over the collapse of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, leaves on the day of a hearing at Manhattan federal court in New York City, US on Jan 3, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried, 30, has been free on a US$250 million bond since pleading not guilty to charges of fraud in the looting of billions of dollars from the now-bankrupt FTX
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prosecutors said their request was in response to Bankman-Fried's recent effort to contact a potential witness against him, the general counsel of an FTX affiliate, and was needed to prevent witness tampering and other obstruction of justice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They said a Signal ban isn't necessary because Bankman-Fried is not using the auto-delete feature, and the concern that he might is "unfounded"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyers also asked to remove a bail condition preventing Bankman-Fried from accessing FTX, Alameda or cryptocurrency assets, saying there was "no evidence" he was responsible for earlier alleged unauthorised transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an order on Saturday, Kaplan gave prosecutors until Monday to address Bankman-Fried's concerns

                Defending Housing and Local Government Minister Nga Kor Ming’s plan to invite experts from other countries, including Singapore, to improve Malaysia’s existing housing policies, Pua said Muhammad Sanusi’s racially-tinged criticism was totally unwarranted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Puah, who is also Johor PKR vice-chairman, said there is no denying that Singapore’s Housing Development Board (HDB) is one of the most successful housing policies in the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that Singapore’s HDB units not only provide quality and affordable housing for its citizens, but its subsequent maintenance is also good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kedah Perikatan Nasional (PN) chief claimed that there is a hidden plan to revive the local government elections by emulating Singapore’s HDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dismissing the claims, Puah said Muhammad Sanusi may not realise that affordable housing is among one of the most pressing issues for young Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is after Nga revealed that his ministry would be meeting with contractors from Singapore’s HDB in order to learn about the island republic’s successful public housing programme.

                Defending Housing and Local Government Minister Nga Kor Ming’s plan to invite experts from other countries, including Singapore, to improve Malaysia’s existing housing policies, Pua said Muhammad Sanusi’s racially-tinged criticism was totally unwarranted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Puah, who is also Johor PKR vice-chairman, said there is no denying that Singapore’s Housing Development Board (HDB) is one of the most successful housing policies in the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that Singapore’s HDB units not only provide quality and affordable housing for its citizens, but its subsequent maintenance is also good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kedah Perikatan Nasional (PN) chief claimed that there is a hidden plan to revive the local government elections by emulating Singapore’s HDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dismissing the claims, Puah said Muhammad Sanusi may not realise that affordable housing is among one of the most pressing issues for young Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is after Nga revealed that his ministry would be meeting with contractors from Singapore’s HDB in order to learn about the island republic’s successful public housing programme.

                On January 18, 2023, BMW of North America announced a safety recall for all 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP motorcycles due to the potential risk of a broken gearbox input shaft

                BMW intensified its analysis of the issue, and eventually determined that if there is an abrupt difference between the engine speed and the rotational speed of the final drive component, the gearbox input shaft could become overloaded, and break as a result

                That’s why BMW decided to issue this recall.  Owners will be notified via postal mail that they should stop riding their affected bikes and contact their local authorized BMW dealer for recall service

                So all those payments take away from your retirement income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of December 2022, the average new car loan for a buyer with great credit was 8.6%, according to MyAutoloan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if you have bad credit, that average soars up to 22.16%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s about as much as the interest rate on a credit card
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If $400 goes into a car payment, and $300 to a credit card and more for student loans, suddenly you have far less cash on hand for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why not pay down your mortgage too? It’s not just the cheaper borrowing costs, although with the average national mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed rate at 6.15%, that is an advantage

                So all those payments take away from your retirement income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of December 2022, the average new car loan for a buyer with great credit was 8.6%, according to MyAutoloan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if you have bad credit, that average soars up to 22.16%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s about as much as the interest rate on a credit card
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If $400 goes into a car payment, and $300 to a credit card and more for student loans, suddenly you have far less cash on hand for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why not pay down your mortgage too? It’s not just the cheaper borrowing costs, although with the average national mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed rate at 6.15%, that is an advantage
            </p>

                Aulas closing the door on a potential move could be seen as him trying to put pressure on Chelsea to increase their first offer and agree to let Gusto stay at Lyon on loan until the end of the season, which Chelsea have refused to agree to so far in the negotiations

                Gusto has now played 47 times already with Lyon, his hometown club, including some European games and he is also on Didier Deschamps' radar for the national team after having represented France in every youth team

                Tan’s defence lawyers said in court that she intends to file an appeal against her conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The acquitted charge relates to an alleged incident of Tan hitting Lozares’ torso with a stick sometime in 2018 at the residence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court heard that Tan’s abuse of the victims began in September 2018, a month after both Lozares and Vegafria were employed by Tan’s husband Sim Guan Huat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her evidence, Lozares said that Tan was angry with her for putting on the socks wrongly

                About Us Advertise   PUTRAJAYA, Jan 26 — Umno will carry out a large-scale 'cleansing' of the party by focusing on those found to have sabotaged the party and its candidates in the 15th general election (GE15), party president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In the recent Umno general assembly, I said we will carry out a large-scale cleansing of the party including those who sabotaged the party and party candidates in GE15, including those who ‘shot themselves in the foot’ (self-sabotage) during the election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if the Supreme Council will discuss the membership status of former party youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin, who had been critical of the party leadership as well as being vocal in wanting the top two posts to be contested, Ahmad Zahid said this will only be known after the meeting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2022 Umno General Assembly recently approved a motion for the president and deputy president posts to not be contested during the party election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Separately, Ahmad Zahid, who is also the deputy prime minister, said the government has not yet decided whether the Political Funding Bill will be tabled in the next Parliament session
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He, however, welcomed support from all political party leaders to be directly involved in drafting the bill

                Pep Guardiola vents his frustration after Manchester City's comeback win over Tottenham in the Premier League

                And just this week, Guardiola said that City had "no chance" of catching Arsenal in the title race if they continued to play as they have been in recent weeks
            </p>

                With Ten Hag and United, the challenge is less immediate, but it is there nonetheless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Guardiola has never had to worry about United being a rival in terms of winning trophies

                MANCHESTER UNITED fans really were united after Wout Weghorst bagged his first goal for the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Netherlands international opened his account for the club in the first leg of United's Carabao Cup semi-final tie with Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst - who joined on loan at the Theatre of Dreams from Burnley to replace Cristiano Ronaldo - doubled United's lead with a perfectly-placed rebound before the stroke of half-time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And his finish - and how he's settled in at his new club better than new Al-Nassr star Ronaldo - quickly became the talk of the Old Trafford faithful

                MANCHESTER UNITED fans really were united after Wout Weghorst bagged his first goal for the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Netherlands international opened his account for the club in the first leg of United's Carabao Cup semi-final tie with Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst - who joined on loan at the Theatre of Dreams from Burnley to replace Cristiano Ronaldo - doubled United's lead with a perfectly-placed rebound before the stroke of half-time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And his finish - and how he's settled in at his new club better than new Al-Nassr star Ronaldo - quickly became the talk of the Old Trafford faithful

            <p>
                It is not enough to have soul but no excellence or excellence and no soul,” Osman said.

                The Prime Minister also stated that Islamic civilisation studies are long overdue in the national curriculum

                That is the tradition of seeking knowledge,” said Anwar

                It is not enough to have soul but no excellence or excellence and no soul

            <p>
                To enable a smooth movement in his official capacity as the Deputy Prime Minister, Ahmad Zahid said he was required to be in and out of the country and this would necessitate him holding his own passport

            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid also said that his travel document was needed, as it was required for him to apply for a diplomatic passport for official business inside and outside of the country

            <p>

                Elon Musk sees the toughest competition for Tesla in China, home of the company he expects “most likely to be second” in electric vehicles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China is Tesla Inc’s second-largest market — accounted for about two-thirds of all electric vehicles sales globally in 2022 — and the home of Tesla’s biggest plant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked about Tesla’s competition, Musk responded that he respected car companies in China, calling it the most competitive market in the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Musk did not identify any Chinese automakers by name

            <p>
                “And so we guess, there is probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla.” Tesla recently promoted China chief Tom Zhu to run US factories and sales in North America and Europe, Reuters has reported

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 26 — Any “madani” concept for the advancement of civil society must properly follow the precepts of Islam to succeed, according to PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang

            <p>

                He stressed that the gathering of Muslims and non-Muslims living together as a plural society in the Arabic city of Medina proves the success of the “madani” concept
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 26 — Despite its explanation, the Education Ministry continued to come under fire from some parents of the SMK Infant Jesus Convent in Johor over a workshop for students who will be sitting for their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a joint statement, eight members of the secondary school’s parent-teacher association (PTA) asserted that there were discrepancies between the ministry’s explanations and what they had been told by SMK Infant Jesus Convent’s principal Ande Noor Munawarah Bachok, news portal The Vibes reported today

                According to The Telegraph, Arsenal are actively showing interest in Caicedo as the club considers midfield options

            <p>
                An ideal alternative to Moises Caicedo would be Amadou Onana

            <p>
                It's believed Onana was on the Gunners' radar prior to his move to Merseyside, but again, he would not come cheaply

            <p>
                Regardless of what happens in midfield, Arsenal beating the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Newcastle to land one of the hottest prospects in football would be an exciting piece of business in the remaining days of the window

                After experiencing their second major flood in three years, some residents of Kampung Contoh have grown weary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This time, it is not so bad, the (water) level is only around my waist," the 45-year-old told CNA on Thursday (Jan 26)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet for residents in Kampung Contoh, what is most concerning is the increasing frequency of the floods.  Student Nurul Husnina Kamaluddin, another Kampung Contoh resident, told CNA that this was the second time in three years her family was forced to evacuate their home due to floods.  "I still remember how in end-2021, the floods were so bad, we had to be moved to the relief shelter on boats," the 16-year-old recounted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's tiring," she added.  Kampung Contoh is located near the Kahang River
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Residents told CNA that the village is flood-prone because the river tends to overflow when it rains heavily

            <p>
                After experiencing their second major flood in three years, some residents of Kampung Contoh have grown weary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This time, it is not so bad, the (water) level is only around my waist," the 45-year-old told CNA on Thursday (Jan 26)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet for residents in Kampung Contoh, what is most concerning is the increasing frequency of the floods.  Student Nurul Husnina Kamaluddin, another Kampung Contoh resident, told CNA that this was the second time in three years her family was forced to evacuate their home due to floods.  "I still remember how in end-2021, the floods were so bad, we had to be moved to the relief shelter on boats," the 16-year-old recounted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's tiring," she added.  Kampung Contoh is located near the Kahang River
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Residents told CNA that the village is flood-prone because the river tends to overflow when it rains heavily

                China is Tesla's second-largest market - accounting for about two-thirds of all electric vehicles sales globally in 2022 - and the home of Tesla's biggest plant

                German Leopard 2 and American M1 Abrams tanks, in addition to British Challenger 2 tanks pledged earlier in January, will be the first heavy combat vehicles sent to join in the fight against Russian forces
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US has pledged to send 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine

            <p>
                Some analysts had earlier declared tanks obsolete in the face of effective anti-tank weapons, which contributed to Russian losses of almost 970 tanks according to open-source intelligence defense website Oryx

                Police officers aiding flood evacuees in Kota Marudu, Sabah on Jan 26, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of 12pm on Thursday (Jan 26), Malaysia’s National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) recorded 5,528 flood victims in Johor and 6,331 flood victims in Sabah.  This is an increase from the 3,937 flood victims in Johor recorded by the agency 24 hours prior.  Bernama reported that 55 relief centres have been opened in Johor as of 8am on Thursday to house the flood evacuees
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Segamat was the most affected district in Johor, followed by Kluang and Mersing, according to the state disaster management committee on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Sabah has seen more than 6,000 new flood evacuees in just a day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Bernama, 26 flood relief centres were opened as of 8am on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last month, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who is the Central Disaster Management Committee chairman, called for immediate long-term measures to resolve the country’s flood problem, including holistic flood mitigation projects.  Ahmad Zahid said that such flood management efforts, when completed, could ensure good long-term flood management until 2100

                Latest Arsenal news takes a closer look at how Mohamed Elneny's injury setback could affect Mikel Arteta's plans leading up to transfer deadline day and the remainder of the season Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters The one downside coming out of Mikel Arteta's press conference ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup fourth round tie against Manchester City was the Mohamed Elneny injury update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But let’s see."  Whilst Elneny is by no means a regular under Arteta, he has proven to be a decent backup option for Thomas Partey at the base of Arsenal's midfield over the past six to eight months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One option, of course, is dipping into the transfer market before next Tuesday's deadline and Arteta himself has publicly stated that in an ideal world, he will be able to sign a midfielder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Well, we need some more cover in midfield ideally if we can," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having to rest Thomas today, I think it was a good option."  Hopefully, Elneny's injury isn't too serious and is available for selection soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in the event that he is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines and Arsenal don't manage to sign a replacement before the January transfer window closes then all signs point towards Arteta revisiting the Lokonga experiment as cover for Partey

                Latest Arsenal news takes a closer look at how Mohamed Elneny's injury setback could affect Mikel Arteta's plans leading up to transfer deadline day and the remainder of the season Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters The one downside coming out of Mikel Arteta's press conference ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup fourth round tie against Manchester City was the Mohamed Elneny injury update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But let’s see."  Whilst Elneny is by no means a regular under Arteta, he has proven to be a decent backup option for Thomas Partey at the base of Arsenal's midfield over the past six to eight months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One option, of course, is dipping into the transfer market before next Tuesday's deadline and Arteta himself has publicly stated that in an ideal world, he will be able to sign a midfielder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Well, we need some more cover in midfield ideally if we can," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having to rest Thomas today, I think it was a good option."  Hopefully, Elneny's injury isn't too serious and is available for selection soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in the event that he is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines and Arsenal don't manage to sign a replacement before the January transfer window closes then all signs point towards Arteta revisiting the Lokonga experiment as cover for Partey

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 25 — The police cautioned the public today against joining two planned marches to the Swedish embassy here on Friday as both would violate public assembly laws
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The police did not receive any notification of assembly from any party to hold any assembly as provided under Section 9 (1) of the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Assembly without notification is an offence under Section 9 (5) of the same Act,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the police, one march was scheduled for approximately 8.30am this coming Friday, from the Tabung Haji Mosque to the Swedish Embassy in Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other was scheduled for about 2pm the same day, after the compulsory Muslim Friday prayers, marching from the As-Syakirin KLCC Mosque to the embassy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Swedish authorities have said the act did not violate any of the country’s laws

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 25 — The police cautioned the public today against joining two planned marches to the Swedish embassy here on Friday as both would violate public assembly laws
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The police did not receive any notification of assembly from any party to hold any assembly as provided under Section 9 (1) of the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Assembly without notification is an offence under Section 9 (5) of the same Act,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the police, one march was scheduled for approximately 8.30am this coming Friday, from the Tabung Haji Mosque to the Swedish Embassy in Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other was scheduled for about 2pm the same day, after the compulsory Muslim Friday prayers, marching from the As-Syakirin KLCC Mosque to the embassy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Swedish authorities have said the act did not violate any of the country’s laws

                As of 2pm, the number of flood victims in Johor alone increased to 4,207 people from 1,164 families currently placed in 45 temporary relief centers in Segamat, Muar, Kluang, Kota Tinggi, Batu Pahat and Mersing

                Lee Cheng Yan could have the luxury car forfeited to the state following the hearing in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was not said in court when Lee had allegedly pledged the vehicle to his parents

            <p>
                The value of the car was also not mentioned in court

            <p>
                His sister added Lee had pledged the car to them to repay his loans

            <p>
                Lee, who is now serving his jail sentence and is not represented by a lawyer, turned up in court in his purple prison outfit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the officer was standing next to the driver’s door, Lee suddenly reversed the car then accelerated forward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lee was also ordered to pay a $1,000 penalty over graft charges

                About Us Advertise   NEW YORK, Jan 25 ― A woman in New York state has filed a civil suit against Mike Tyson, accusing the former boxing champion of raping her in a limousine in the early 1990s, according to court filings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The woman, who asked the court to remain anonymous, filed her complaint in early January under a temporary New York state law allowing victims of sexual assault to seek civil damages regardless of the statute of limitations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tyson spent three years in jail beginning in 1992 after being found guilty of raping model Desiree Washington, who was 18 at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As a result of Tyson's rape, I suffered and continue to suffer from physical, psychological and emotional injury,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By late Tuesday, Tyson had not issued any public statement

                Stocks went on to surge as much as 52% after the July 2020 golden cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The indicator can help alert traders to securities in the stock market that are solidifying their uptrend and are likely to experience a continuation with higher stock prices.  In December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average flashed the golden cross signal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The opposite signal to the golden cross is the "death cross," which is a sell signal that triggers when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He found that on average, stocks were higher three months after a golden cross 62% of the time, and higher six months after the golden cross 64% of the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average three-month return when stocks were higher after a golden cross was 7.33%, while the average return six months after the golden cross was 10.65%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stressing the importance that moving average crossover signals are not perfect, Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co., said of The Chart Report, "All big rallies start with a golden cross, but not all golden crosses lead to a big rally." The golden cross signal is one of many trading patterns that technical analysts employ to buy stocks. Meanwhile, the bearish death cross is in addition to many trading patterns that traders use to sell stocks.

                Even a new year can't shake the bearishness from GMO's Jeremy Grantham, who said in a Tuesday letter that the stock market will drop another 20% this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Grantham said the ongoing deterioration of financial conditions will be capped off by a downturn in the housing market, representing the "final phase" of the stock market bubble that should help drive the S&P 500 to 3,200 by year-end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So you shouldn't be tempted to think its absolutely cannot happen," Grantham warned.  The key to whether or not Grantham's bleak scenario plays out this year hinges on investor confidence, which was on a slow yet steady decline throughout 2022 as every rally in stocks ended up being sold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The debt ceiling is another overhang for investors this year.  "Almost any pin can prick such supreme confidence and cause the first quick and severe decline," Grantham said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's because in 1929, 2000, and 2007, the largest part of the stock market decline occurred after the first rate cut from the Fed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Grantham does take comfort in the fact that corporate earnings estimates have yet to significantly decline despite all of the bearish possibilities.  "But still I'd prefer a lot more optimism, which a year ago was nearly universal," Grantham said.

                Alcaraz, who can definitely play a bit, released Che Adams but the sub almost had too much time to think and shot too close to Pope, who stuck out a foot to save.  This was more like it from Southampton and soon Adams forced a sprawling save from Pope.  But then Alexander Isak, just on for Callum Wilson, beat his man down the right and centred low for Joelinton to finally end his frustration from two yards as the Geordies cavorted behind him

                As Mohammed Salisu hacked clear, there were a queue of Newcastle players waiting but Joelinton seemed to control with his arm before his shot found the net and ref Stuart Attwell ruled it out.  Pope was soon forced into an improvised save from a fizzing, swerving low drive from Carlos Alcaraz.  And Pope, suddenly busy, had to dart out of his area to clear from Moussa Djenepro, thudding into the Saints winger as he did so but escaping punishment despite the howls of the home players and supporters

                After the break, Almiron was leaving scorched earth down the left flank again but when he cut back, Sean Longstaff cleared the bar, the theme for Newcastle’s evening
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Almiron’s pace and trickery bewildered the Saints defence but after his low centre located Joelinton six yards out, the Brazilian somehow shot over despite attempting to side-foot, rather than blast it

                As Mohammed Salisu hacked clear, there were a queue of Newcastle players waiting but Joelinton seemed to control with his arm before his shot found the net and ref Stuart Attwell ruled it out.  Pope was soon forced into an improvised save from a fizzing, swerving low drive from Carlos Alcaraz.  And Pope, suddenly busy, had to dart out of his area to clear from Moussa Djenepro, thudding into the Saints winger as he did so but escaping punishment despite the howls of the home players and supporters

                Almiron’s pace and trickery bewildered the Saints defence but after his low centre located Joelinton six yards out, the Brazilian somehow shot over despite attempting to side-foot, rather than blast it

                Alcaraz, who can definitely play a bit, released Che Adams but the sub almost had too much time to think and shot too close to Pope, who stuck out a foot to save.  This was more like it from Southampton and soon Adams forced a sprawling save from Pope.  But then Alexander Isak, just on for Callum Wilson, beat his man down the right and centred low for Joelinton to finally end his frustration from two yards as the Geordies cavorted behind him

                Stocks went on to surge as much as 52% after the July 2020 golden cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The indicator can help alert traders to securities in the stock market that are solidifying their uptrend and are likely to experience a continuation with higher stock prices.  In December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average flashed the golden cross signal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The opposite signal to the golden cross is the "death cross," which is a sell signal that triggers when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He found that on average, stocks were higher three months after a golden cross 62% of the time, and higher six months after the golden cross 64% of the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average three-month return when stocks were higher after a golden cross was 7.33%, while the average return six months after the golden cross was 10.65%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stressing the importance that moving average crossover signals are not perfect, Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co., said of The Chart Report, "All big rallies start with a golden cross, but not all golden crosses lead to a big rally." The golden cross signal is one of many trading patterns that technical analysts employ to buy stocks. Meanwhile, the bearish death cross is in addition to many trading patterns that traders use to sell stocks.

                (Bloomberg) -- China invoked the US’s brinkmanship over its own debt limit as it hit back at Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s criticism of Beijing’s handling of debt issues in developing countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China holds about $870 billion in US debt, according to the latest data for November, down from more than $1.3 trillion in late 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China has become the world’s biggest creditor to developing countries, some of which are facing a mounting debt crisis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Debt Burden China has come under criticism for its perceived lack of engagement in a global effort to reduce debt burdens for developing nations, with Yellen saying on multiple occasions that Beijing has become the biggest obstacle to progress
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She repeated the call on Monday in Zambia, which Africa’s first pandemic-era sovereign defaulter in 2020, and since then has been struggling to revamp external debt that topped $17 billion, more than a third of which is held by Chinese creditors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Assuming Secretary Yellen’s statements about debt were correct, the best prospect of the debt issues outside the US would be the US Treasury Department solving the US’ own domestic debt problem, given how well she knows about facts, her professional capacities and her team’s implementation ability,” the Chinese embassy in Lusaka said

                (Bloomberg) -- China invoked the US’s brinkmanship over its own debt limit as it hit back at Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s criticism of Beijing’s handling of debt issues in developing countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China holds about $870 billion in US debt, according to the latest data for November, down from more than $1.3 trillion in late 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China has become the world’s biggest creditor to developing countries, some of which are facing a mounting debt crisis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Debt Burden China has come under criticism for its perceived lack of engagement in a global effort to reduce debt burdens for developing nations, with Yellen saying on multiple occasions that Beijing has become the biggest obstacle to progress
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She repeated the call on Monday in Zambia, which Africa’s first pandemic-era sovereign defaulter in 2020, and since then has been struggling to revamp external debt that topped $17 billion, more than a third of which is held by Chinese creditors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Assuming Secretary Yellen’s statements about debt were correct, the best prospect of the debt issues outside the US would be the US Treasury Department solving the US’ own domestic debt problem, given how well she knows about facts, her professional capacities and her team’s implementation ability,” the Chinese embassy in Lusaka said

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then suddenly that morning Google’s parent, Alphabet, announced that it was cutting 12,000 jobs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justin Moore had worked at Google for more than 16 years, according to his LinkedIn profile, before he was laid off last Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I’m sad, angry,” said Bolick, who had been at the company for over four years.When employees lost access to their company communication channels, it was harder for them to bid farewell to colleagues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A Google product manager, Manas Minglani, who was impacted by the layoffs wrote that he couldn’t say his goodbyes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google’s most recent quarterly earnings, announced in October, missed analyst expectations

                Thai officials are angry at plans by Cambodia to refer to the event -- which they regard as their national sport -- on the official programme as Kun Khmer instead of Muay Thai
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the name Muay Thai may be better known around the world, Cambodian officials insist the sport originated from their Khmer culture
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Charoen Wattanasin, vice-chairman of the National Olympic Committee of Thailand, said the International Olympic Committee had not endorsed the term Kun Khmer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We are the host country so we have the right to change it to Kun Khmer as the sport has its origin in Khmer and it is our culture," Vath Chamroeun, secretary-general of the Cambodian Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee, told AFP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sport will be called Muay Thai at that event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muay Thai secured Olympic recognition as a sport in 2021 -- but its pathway to the Olympic games is uncertain because of safety concerns

                Thai officials are angry at plans by Cambodia to refer to the event -- which they regard as their national sport -- on the official programme as Kun Khmer instead of Muay Thai
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the name Muay Thai may be better known around the world, Cambodian officials insist the sport originated from their Khmer culture
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Charoen Wattanasin, vice-chairman of the National Olympic Committee of Thailand, said the International Olympic Committee had not endorsed the term Kun Khmer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We are the host country so we have the right to change it to Kun Khmer as the sport has its origin in Khmer and it is our culture," Vath Chamroeun, secretary-general of the Cambodian Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee, told AFP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sport will be called Muay Thai at that event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muay Thai secured Olympic recognition as a sport in 2021 -- but its pathway to the Olympic games is uncertain because of safety concerns
            </p>
