                About Us Advertise   SHAH ALAM, March 9 ― The Societies Act 1966 (Act 832) is a law approved by Parliament, and if there are parties who want it amended, the matter should be brought up in Parliament, said Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If there is disagreement, you have to look back at the Societies Act 1966
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is an act that was approved by Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said this to comment on the video clip of former Rembau Member of Parliament, Khairy Jamaluddin, who was not satisfied with Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail's decision to grant exemption to Umno in accordance with Section 70 of the Societies Act 1966 (Act 832), regarding the party's election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Umno's next direction, Ahmad Zahid expects that the party's new leadership line-up, which will be elected, will work with him to translate the implementation of the party's new direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said that the direction, which has 21 steps, will be announced and realised after the party's election on March 18

                About Us Advertise   SHAH ALAM, March 9 ― The Societies Act 1966 (Act 832) is a law approved by Parliament, and if there are parties who want it amended, the matter should be brought up in Parliament, said Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If there is disagreement, you have to look back at the Societies Act 1966
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is an act that was approved by Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said this to comment on the video clip of former Rembau Member of Parliament, Khairy Jamaluddin, who was not satisfied with Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail's decision to grant exemption to Umno in accordance with Section 70 of the Societies Act 1966 (Act 832), regarding the party's election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Umno's next direction, Ahmad Zahid expects that the party's new leadership line-up, which will be elected, will work with him to translate the implementation of the party's new direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said that the direction, which has 21 steps, will be announced and realised after the party's election on March 18

                welcome back! — and with the squad still in need of reinforcements at key positions, Liverpool are back in the transfer rumour section with a vengeance, linked with players left and right in the past few days

            <p>
                While Goncalo Ramos was the standout this time around, notching a goal either side of half-time, rumours — and any reasonable analysis of squad needs — are that Liverpool were rather looking at Florentino Luís and António Silva

            <p>
                While Silva is a somewhat raw but exceptionally gifted ball-playing centre-back who made his debut for the side as an 18-year old this season, Florentino has been around for a while, and is by many considered the catalyst for Enzo Fernández’s outstanding six months at the club before moving to Chelsea for circus money in January, as his ability to cover ground and spot a tackle allowed the Argentinian freedom to roam

                While Milan can celebrate reaching the last eight of Europe's premier club competition for the first time since 2011-12, Spurs are left to rue another trophyless season with a performance that will increase speculation over the future of head coach Antonio Conte

                After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the bank isn’t finished raising rates, one market expert has warned a crash could come in a matter of days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The withdrawal of capital from middle-class families has been "spectacular," McDonald argued, as the Fed continues its most aggressive rate hike campaign since the 1980s to crush decades-high inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Ten million in cash today generates $510,000 a year in Treasuries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have to do the math here, common sense," McDonald explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You're flat to down after two years, and now you're looking over at a money market fund or a one-year treasury, and you get $510,000 of interest risk-free when a year ago you were getting 70." The market crash trigger, he further predicted, will come from the S&P earnings missing estimates big time

                After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the bank isn’t finished raising rates, one market expert has warned a crash could come in a matter of days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The withdrawal of capital from middle-class families has been "spectacular," McDonald argued, as the Fed continues its most aggressive rate hike campaign since the 1980s to crush decades-high inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Ten million in cash today generates $510,000 a year in Treasuries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have to do the math here, common sense," McDonald explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You're flat to down after two years, and now you're looking over at a money market fund or a one-year treasury, and you get $510,000 of interest risk-free when a year ago you were getting 70." The market crash trigger, he further predicted, will come from the S&P earnings missing estimates big time

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 — Home Minister Senator Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has defended his decision to exempt Umno from deregistration over its motion to prohibit contests for its top two posts during internal elections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dissatisfied with Saifuddin’s answer, Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan (Perikatan Nasional - Kota Baru) then asked the minister to verify a supposed letter from the Registrar of Societies (RoS) to Umno directing the party to take “corrective measure” over the motion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Opposition chief whip said the minister’s decision to exempt Umno could have broad ramifications for all parties in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Saifuddin said he had, using his power as the home minister under Section 70 of the Societies Act, decided to exempt Umno from complying with that Act’s Section 13(1)(c)(iv) in relation to the approved motion in the 2022 Umno general assembly to not have the top two posts contested, after the reference was made to Umno’s party constitution and its rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Section 70 states the home minister’s power to use his discretion to exempt any society registered under the Societies Act from all or any of the provisions of the Act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid said Umno’s secretary-general had received a letter from the Home Ministry to approve the no-contest motion for the top two posts and said it was sufficient to prove that the motion was legitimate, also insisting that the Home Minister has the final say.

                Malaysia said on Wednesday it will summon to court the descendants of a former sultan in a dispute involving three of the government's properties in Paris, following the heirs' efforts to enforce a US$15 billion (RM67 billion) arbitration award
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Filipino heirs of the last Sultan of Sulu won the award in a French arbitration court last year in a dispute over a colonial-era land agreement, which independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the descendants a token sum annually
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia, which did not participate in the arbitration, maintains the process was illegal and has obtained a stay on the ruling in France
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The court order gave the bailiffs the instruction to enter non-diplomatic property with an eye to their valuation and sale to meet Malaysia's debt," Mason said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The dispute stems from an 1878 agreement that was signed between two European colonists and the Sultan of Sulu for use of his territory in present-day Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Independent Malaysia stopped payments in 2013 after a bloody incursion by supporters of the former sultanate who wanted to reclaim land from Malaysia

                Malaysia said on Wednesday it will summon to court the descendants of a former sultan in a dispute involving three of the government's properties in Paris, following the heirs' efforts to enforce a US$15 billion (RM67 billion) arbitration award
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Filipino heirs of the last Sultan of Sulu won the award in a French arbitration court last year in a dispute over a colonial-era land agreement, which independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the descendants a token sum annually
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia, which did not participate in the arbitration, maintains the process was illegal and has obtained a stay on the ruling in France
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The court order gave the bailiffs the instruction to enter non-diplomatic property with an eye to their valuation and sale to meet Malaysia's debt," Mason said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The dispute stems from an 1878 agreement that was signed between two European colonists and the Sultan of Sulu for use of his territory in present-day Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Independent Malaysia stopped payments in 2013 after a bloody incursion by supporters of the former sultanate who wanted to reclaim land from Malaysia

                Mr Sivakumar Packirisamy, president of the non-governmental organisation Green Earth Society in Johor, expressed concern that floodwaters have not receded in parts of the state, despite the weather being mostly sunny over the last couple of days.  He highlighted that in places like Batu Pahat for instance, the water level has actually increased, leading to more people being forced out of their homes.   “Flood mitigation measures along the rivers in Johor have to be improved

                On Monday, Johor chief minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi warned that in spite of good weather, residents of Batu Pahat needed to be wary as river water from Segamat was flowing south and causing water levels to rise in some areas.  Batu Pahat is the worst-hit district in Johor, with more than 27,000 people displaced.  Mr Ling Tian Soon, state assemblyman for Yong Peng, told CNA on Monday that a key reason why many areas of Batu Pahat were flooded was because of overflow from the Bekok River

            <p>
                Mohamad was responding to a supplementary question by Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan (PN-Tasek Gelugor), who asked if the government was hiding the name of the sole company importing eggs from India to Malaysia

                “Whether or not I’m sued, it’s not an issue because I want the government to solve this issue,” said Dr Wee

                We want everyone to feel good and that’s what we are hoping for in Malaysia,” added Mohamad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Wee had previously warned that the government would face a barrage of criticisms if the chicken egg shortage was not solved as Ramadan and Hari Raya Aidilfitri drew near
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Mohamad was responding to a supplementary question by Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan (PN-Tasek Gelugor), who asked if the government was hiding the name of the sole company importing eggs from India to Malaysia

                The Special Sulu Task Force said in a statement on Wednesday (March 8) that the attempt by the bailiffs to assess the value of the properties that house the Malaysian Embassy and staff quarters went against the convention of diplomatic immunity

                “Moving forward, it is Malaysia’s intention to summon the Sulu claimants to appear before the court which granted the authorisation order to obtain the cancellation of the registration of the mortgage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian government said Malaysia does not recognise the purported commercial arbitration which was started by the Sulu claimants, and stressed that Malaysia will “continue to vigorously defend its sovereignty through the appropriate legal forums”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the third set of Malaysian assets that the alleged Sulu heirs have been trying to seize, after Stampa decided on February 28, 2022 that Malaysia should pay US$14.92 billion to the eight Sulu claimants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Sulu claimants started arbitration in 2019 with Stampa who was appointed in Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Later when a Spanish court cancelled Stampa’s appointment as an arbitrator for the case, Stampa and the Sulu claimants ignored this and shifted the entire arbitration to France
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ignoring Spanish and French courts’ decisions which meant the arbitration was illegitimate, Stampa later proceeded to give his arbitration decision in February 2022 to order Malaysia to pay US$14.92 billion to the eight Sulu claimants

                “Moving forward, it is Malaysia’s intention to summon the Sulu claimants to appear before the court which granted the authorisation order to obtain the cancellation of the registration of the mortgage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian government said Malaysia does not recognise the purported commercial arbitration which was started by the Sulu claimants, and stressed that Malaysia will “continue to vigorously defend its sovereignty through the appropriate legal forums”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the third set of Malaysian assets that the alleged Sulu heirs have been trying to seize, after Stampa decided on February 28, 2022 that Malaysia should pay US$14.92 billion to the eight Sulu claimants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Sulu claimants started arbitration in 2019 with Stampa who was appointed in Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Later when a Spanish court cancelled Stampa’s appointment as an arbitrator for the case, Stampa and the Sulu claimants ignored this and shifted the entire arbitration to France
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ignoring Spanish and French courts’ decisions which meant the arbitration was illegitimate, Stampa later proceeded to give his arbitration decision in February 2022 to order Malaysia to pay US$14.92 billion to the eight Sulu claimants

                Meanwhile, approved investments in the manufacturing sector stood at RM84.3 billion (31.9%) and primary industry at RM26.3 billion (9.9%), said International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There were two large one-off investments that happened in 2021 from Intel and China’s Risen Energy Co Ltd,” he told reporters during the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) media conference on Malaysia’s investment performance for 2022

            <p>
                Earlier in his speech, Tengku Zafrul said foreign direct investments (FDIs) accounted for 61.7% or RM163.3 billion of the total approved investments, while domestic direct investments (DDIs) contributed 38.3% or RM101.3 billion

                As for the investment outlook for 2023, he said the moderation in global economic growth may impact investment decisions globally.  “The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank projected a positive but slower economic growth compared to the previous years, so investments will also be impacted, as it also depends on demand

                These accounts were set up before 2003 – when non-citizens or permanent residents were disallowed from making voluntary contributions to their CPF accounts

                Most of them have low balances, and more than 200,000 of them have less than $5,000 accrued over the years, as Singapore adopted various changes in its CPF contribution policy for foreigners

                That eventually moved to a system where those on work permits could make CPF contributions voluntarily, instead of having to make compulsory contributions to their CPF accounts

                These accounts were set up before 2003 – when non-citizens or permanent residents were disallowed from making voluntary contributions to their CPF accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The remaining savings can still be transferred to their bank accounts at any time after that.” Some of these CPF accounts happen to include people who have relinquished their citizenship or permanent residency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Most of them have low balances, and more than 200,000 of them have less than $5,000 accrued over the years, as Singapore adopted various changes in its CPF contribution policy for foreigners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before 1987, CPF contributions were compulsory for all employees working in the country, regardless of nationality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That eventually moved to a system where those on work permits could make CPF contributions voluntarily, instead of having to make compulsory contributions to their CPF accounts
            </p>

            <p>
                “There were two large one-off investments that happened in 2021 from Intel and China’s Risen Energy Co Ltd,” he told reporters during the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) media conference on Malaysia’s investment performance for 2022

                Earlier in his speech, Tengku Zafrul said foreign direct investments (FDIs) accounted for 61.7% or RM163.3 billion of the total approved investments, while domestic direct investments (DDIs) contributed 38.3% or RM101.3 billion

            <p>
                As for the investment outlook for 2023, he said the moderation in global economic growth may impact investment decisions globally.  “The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank projected a positive but slower economic growth compared to the previous years, so investments will also be impacted, as it also depends on demand

                Earlier in his speech, Tengku Zafrul said foreign direct investments (FDIs) accounted for 61.7% or RM163.3 billion of the total approved investments, while domestic direct investments (DDIs) contributed 38.3% or RM101.3 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This must be improved further in the near future, especially with our renewed focus on an effective economic policy, favourable investment environment, political stability, and more coordinated investment promotion by all agencies, both at the federal government and state levels,” Tengku Zafrul said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the investment outlook for 2023, he said the moderation in global economic growth may impact investment decisions globally.  “The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank projected a positive but slower economic growth compared to the previous years, so investments will also be impacted, as it also depends on demand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Investment decisions are a little different from trade as (they are) based on long-term plans

                Khairy, who was formerly Umno Youth chief but has now been sacked from the party, argued that this was proof that Umno’s action was invalid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also cited a viral letter allegedly from the Registrar of Societies which said Umno’s motion to not contest the top two posts was invalid as it was in breach of Article 9.3 in Umno’s party constitution, saying that this letter appeared to be genuine to him

            <p>
                Yesterday, Saifuddin said the Home Ministry had under Section 70 of the Societies Act decided to exempt Umno from complying with that Act’s Section 13(1)(c)(iv) in relation to the approved motion in the 2022 Umno general assembly to not have the top two posts contested, after the reference was made to Umno’s party constitution and its rules

            <p>
                Section 70 states the home minister’s power to use his discretion to exempt any society registered under the Societies Act from all or any of the provisions of the Act

            <p>
                Yesterday, Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi claimed to have no knowledge of the viral letter from the RoS which had said the Umno motion — for the top two posts to go unchallenged — was invalid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid said Umno’s secretary-general had received a letter from the Home Ministry to approve the no-contest motion for the top two posts and said it was sufficient to prove that the motion was legitimate, also insisting that the Home Minister has the final say.

                Liverpool are expected to be in the market for reinforcements in defensive areas this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One Bundesliga defender could follow in the footsteps of two current Reds stars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And that’s exactly the kind of player that Liverpool loves because they know there’s value
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ndicka has impressed for Frankfurt this season as his team sits sixth in the Bundesliga, with the imposing center-back winning on average 2.6 aerial duels, averaging 5.2 clearances and 0.7 blocks per Bundesliga appearance this season, according to statistics from WhoScored
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the case of Ndicka, it is clear that Liverpool would be getting another of the Bundesliga's emerging talents, just without having to massively impact the rest of its transfer budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given Ndicka's superior fitness record when compared with current back-up options Gomez and Matip — he has played 22 times for Frankfurt in the Bundesliga this season and turned out 34 times in the league last season — it would be fair to suggest that the former Auxerre defender may prove to be a more reliable option for Klopp

                And that’s exactly the kind of player that Liverpool loves because they know there’s value
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ndicka has impressed for Frankfurt this season as his team sits sixth in the Bundesliga, with the imposing center-back winning on average 2.6 aerial duels, averaging 5.2 clearances and 0.7 blocks per Bundesliga appearance this season, according to statistics from WhoScored
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the case of Ndicka, it is clear that Liverpool would be getting another of the Bundesliga's emerging talents, just without having to massively impact the rest of its transfer budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given Ndicka's superior fitness record when compared with current back-up options Gomez and Matip — he has played 22 times for Frankfurt in the Bundesliga this season and turned out 34 times in the league last season — it would be fair to suggest that the former Auxerre defender may prove to be a more reliable option for Klopp

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 — Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak has not been allowed any access to gadgets while imprisoned, and he has signed up for post-graduate studies while serving his 12-year jail term over the misappropriation of SRC International Sdn Bhd’s RM42 million, Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail confirmed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an exclusive interview with local daily Sin Chew Daily, Saifuddin confirmed that Najib is not allowed to use a laptop or access the internet while in Kajang Prison, but suggested that it was still possible for him to post social media posts through his social media team doing so on his behalf as long as they are able to access his social media accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saifuddin was responding to a question on Najib’s Facebook account continuing to have new posts even while he is in prison
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The minister also said there was no law to stop Najib from expressing his views, noting that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had in the past also expressed his views when he was a prisoner
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like Datuk Seri Anwar previously, was also in prison, his method was when he had the chance to be outside to attend court cases, he would make spontaneous statements or he would make notes to be published, it’s the same
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is now continuing his studies at the post-graduate level.” The minister also explained that there are prisoners who obtain a Masters’ degree or even complete their PhD studies by the time they finish serving their jail term at Kajang Prison.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 — Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki said that the agency had so far recovered RM28.93 billion and assets siphoned through the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) scandal

                Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday interest rates are likely to rise more than previously expected as the central bank works to bring down inflation, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level

            <p>
                The annualized rate of $4 gives the dividend a yield of 9.2%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~26% potential total return profile

            <p>
                Revenue came in at $20.5 billion, for a 10% year-over-year gain, while the operating income rose from $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion

            <p>
                The shares are priced at $13.05 and the $16.57 average price target suggests a one-year gain of 27% from that level

                Their demographic alone amassed nearly $4 trillion in debt in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to the Wall Street Journal's analysis of Federal Reserve Bank of New York data

                Millennials in their 30s have added over $3.8 trillion in debt to their accounts — and are missing their credit card and auto loan payments at startling rates as well, according to the New York Fed

            <p>
                Across all age groups in the survey, mortgage debt makes up the biggest share of outstanding balances — with that number rising by nearly $1 trillion last year, according to the New York Fed

            <p>
                When you don’t pay your credit card bill on time, you risk harming your credit score and adding up on interest and late fees — exacerbating your existing debt and making it more difficult to pay off

                Aside from drivers in their 20s, this age group is also missing the most auto loan payments, says the New York Fed

                Addressing over 100 diplomatic officers here on Tuesday (March 7), Anwar appeared unperturbed by PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang's claims of toppling the current government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abdul Hadi reportedly said that no parties would be able to stop Perikatan Nasional's plans to topple the government, saying that politics is dynamic and that such practice is considered normal in a democratic country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the session, Anwar said in order to bring the country to its past glory, Malaysians, including government officers, must not only uphold good governance but must be ready to make changes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We must do this and affect this change, which is extremely necessary to save this country from the mess that we have been in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar called on the heads of diplomatic missions to do better for the country, and it was vital for Malaysian officers and diplomats overseas to set an example of what it meant to be a good competent leader

                Reported Liverpool target Mason Mount has turned down contract offers of almost £250k-a-week from Chelsea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, claims that the 24-year-old is looking for closer to £300k-a-week have been dismissed as being ‘not true.’ Whatever Mount is demanding though, Chelsea are clearly yet to meet it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As per Spotrac, James currently takes home £250k-a-week at Chelsea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fact that Mount has rejected similar is not particularly encouraging in terms of Liverpool’s pursuit of him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Clearly, there’s absolutely no way Liverpool would pay Mason Mount anything like what they’re paying their No.4, and nor should they
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Various reports have suggested Anfield as a potential destination for Mount
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But with there being no chance of such a long contract on offer at Anfield, maybe that won’t be such a big issue

                Reported Liverpool target Mason Mount has turned down contract offers of almost £250k-a-week from Chelsea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, claims that the 24-year-old is looking for closer to £300k-a-week have been dismissed as being ‘not true.’ Whatever Mount is demanding though, Chelsea are clearly yet to meet it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As per Spotrac, James currently takes home £250k-a-week at Chelsea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fact that Mount has rejected similar is not particularly encouraging in terms of Liverpool’s pursuit of him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Clearly, there’s absolutely no way Liverpool would pay Mason Mount anything like what they’re paying their No.4, and nor should they
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Various reports have suggested Anfield as a potential destination for Mount
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But with there being no chance of such a long contract on offer at Anfield, maybe that won’t be such a big issue
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Mar 7 — Datuk Seri Najib Razak told the sessions court here today that former federal territories deputy minister Edmund Santhara Kumar should not have travelled to New Zealand when Malaysia was under a movement control order (MCO)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prabakaran — said it was “morally wrong” for Edmund to take a 55-day trip abroad when others in Malaysia could not cross its borders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his lawsuit, Santhara claim that during a press conference on March 17, 2021, Prabakaran made allegedly false statements about the former’s trip to New Zealand in 2020

            <p>
                During cross-examination, Santhara’s lawyer, N Krishnan, then reportedly put forth to Najib that Santhara’s trip to New Zealand was not unlawful as it was approved by the then prime minister, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin

                “Plans to make booster jabs compulsory for foreign workers just because of the overstocking of Sinovac vaccines are very irresponsible,” he said in a statement yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Saturday, its chief executive officer was reported to have raised the possibility of the vaccines being used as booster shots for foreign workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa had said last month that the government is looking at making it compulsory for foreign workers to get booster shots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But employers must not be forced or charged any extra cost when implementing any rules pertaining to vaccination or booster shots for foreign workers,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, foreign workers are required to undergo a medical check-up in their home country and be declared medically fit before entering Malaysia
            </p>

                “Plans to make booster jabs compulsory for foreign workers just because of the overstocking of Sinovac vaccines are very irresponsible,” he said in a statement yesterday

                On Saturday, its chief executive officer was reported to have raised the possibility of the vaccines being used as booster shots for foreign workers

            <p>
                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa had said last month that the government is looking at making it compulsory for foreign workers to get booster shots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But employers must not be forced or charged any extra cost when implementing any rules pertaining to vaccination or booster shots for foreign workers,” he said

            <p>
                Currently, foreign workers are required to undergo a medical check-up in their home country and be declared medically fit before entering Malaysia

                Kim Yo-jong (pic) said North Korea is monitoring the "restless military moves by the US forces” and its South Korean "puppet military,” adding Pyongyang is "on standby to take appropriate, quick and overwhelming action at any time according to our judgment,” the official Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday (March 7)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latest comments indicate North Korea could ramp up provocations in conjunction with the drills, with Kim last month threatening to turn the Pacific Ocean into a "firing range” if they went ahead

                The US and South Korea are set to hold their Freedom Shield exercises from March 13-23, drills designed to bolster their defenses against North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The last time North Korea launched a missile into the Pacific was October 2022, when it fired a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan, flying about of 4,600km (2,860 miles), and marking the longest distance traveled by a North Korean missile to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The drills had been scaled down or halted under former President Donald Trump, who was hoping the move would facilitate his nuclear negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un
            </p>
            
            <p>
                North Korea for decades has called the joint exercises a prelude to an invasion and nuclear war

                Kim Yo-jong (pic) said North Korea is monitoring the "restless military moves by the US forces” and its South Korean "puppet military,” adding Pyongyang is "on standby to take appropriate, quick and overwhelming action at any time according to our judgment,” the official Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday (March 7)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latest comments indicate North Korea could ramp up provocations in conjunction with the drills, with Kim last month threatening to turn the Pacific Ocean into a "firing range” if they went ahead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US and South Korea are set to hold their Freedom Shield exercises from March 13-23, drills designed to bolster their defenses against North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The last time North Korea launched a missile into the Pacific was October 2022, when it fired a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan, flying about of 4,600km (2,860 miles), and marking the longest distance traveled by a North Korean missile to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The drills had been scaled down or halted under former President Donald Trump, who was hoping the move would facilitate his nuclear negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un
            </p>
            
            <p>
                North Korea for decades has called the joint exercises a prelude to an invasion and nuclear war

                Ukrainian service members ride atop of a tank outside of the frontline town of Bakhmut, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Donetsk region, Ukraine, on Mar 4, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The eastern Ukrainian city has been badly damaged during the longest and bloodiest battle since Russia's more than year-long invasion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Outside Bakhmut, some Ukrainian soldiers had lost hope that Kyiv would hold the city and looked set to retreat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Ukrainian army said on Sunday that its troops had fought off "more than 130" Russian attacks in a single day around Bakhmut and said Moscow's forces were trying to encircle the city
            </p>
            
            <p>
                About 4,500 civilians remain in Bakhmut, Ukrainian officials have said
            </p>

                Ukrainian service members ride atop of a tank outside of the frontline town of Bakhmut, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Donetsk region, Ukraine, on Mar 4, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The eastern Ukrainian city has been badly damaged during the longest and bloodiest battle since Russia's more than year-long invasion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Outside Bakhmut, some Ukrainian soldiers had lost hope that Kyiv would hold the city and looked set to retreat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Ukrainian army said on Sunday that its troops had fought off "more than 130" Russian attacks in a single day around Bakhmut and said Moscow's forces were trying to encircle the city
            </p>
            
            <p>
                About 4,500 civilians remain in Bakhmut, Ukrainian officials have said

            <p>
                Anwar said the participation of the companies will make Sabah and Sarawak a strategic site in the Brunei Darussalam–Indonesia–Malaysia–Philippines East Asean Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) initiative
            </p>

                He then said that such projects – especially those involving gas – will likely be led by the Sarawak government as it is geographically closer to Nusantara

                For us, including Sarawak, it is also an attractive investment," Anwar added

                "With various other new initiatives by the Sarawak state government, I am confident that it will be a catalyst for more growth for the (BIMP-EAGA) area, God-willing," said the Prime Minister

            <p>
                To the initial question, Anwar said the Federal Government will closely coordinate all development for the project with the Sabah and Sarawak government, adding that Deputy Prime Minister II Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof will be the main coordinator

                "In this matter, I have told the Sarawak Premier that such matters will be coordinated with the state government due to its close proximity to ensure it will be more beneficial,” said Anwar

            <p>
                Anwar said the participation of the companies will make Sabah and Sarawak a strategic site in the Brunei Darussalam–Indonesia–Malaysia–Philippines East Asean Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) initiative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then said that such projects – especially those involving gas – will likely be led by the Sarawak government as it is geographically closer to Nusantara

            <p>
                For us, including Sarawak, it is also an attractive investment," Anwar added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "With various other new initiatives by the Sarawak state government, I am confident that it will be a catalyst for more growth for the (BIMP-EAGA) area, God-willing," said the Prime Minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To the initial question, Anwar said the Federal Government will closely coordinate all development for the project with the Sabah and Sarawak government, adding that Deputy Prime Minister II Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof will be the main coordinator

                The 7-0 hammering of Manchester United will echo for decades but Jurgen Klopp's focus has now moved to Saturday lunchtime's trip to Bournemouth as they look to continue their push for the top four

            <p>
                In midfield, there are strong claims for Stefan Bajcetic to return to the side after his encouraging cameo off the bench on Sunday but it would seem harsh to drop out any of the three who started on Sunday, with Harvey Elliott, in particular, turning in one of his best performances as a Liverpool player

            <p>
                Curtis Jones and James Milner came off the bench on Sunday but with the Reds engine room purring like never before this season, it would seem strange for Klopp to make any major changes for this trip to Gary O'Neil's side

                Roberto Firmino, who is entering the final months of his eight-year spell at Liverpool, did score from the bench against United, of course, but it seems likely that the Brazil international is likely to continue his role as deputy for now as the Reds head down south in a rich vein of form by this season's standards

                SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Rivian Automotive plans to sell bonds worth $1.3 billion, it said on Monday, as weakening demand and lofty costs tighten a cash crunch around electrical vehicle makers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shares in Rivian fell nearly 7% in after-hours trading
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The capital from this offering will help facilitate the launch of Rivian's smaller R2 vehicle family, a Rivian spokesperson told Reuters, adding that convertible debt was "optimal cost of capital versus selling equity at today's levels." Irvine, California-based Rivian, which makes R1T electric pickup trucks and R1S SUVs, has said its cash balance will fund its operations through 2025
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It reported cash and cash equivalents of $11.57 billion at the end of December, down from $13.27 billion a quarter earlier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Late last year, it shelved plans to build delivery vans in Europe with Mercedes and had earlier pushed back by a year to 2026 the planned launch of a smaller R2 vehicle family at the $5 billion plant it is building in Georgia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rivian's bond will mature in March 2029 and investors will have the option to convert the bonds into cash or shares in the EV maker

                Liverpool hero Jamie Carragher did not hold back in his assessment of Casemiro after the Brazilian was at the heart of a Manchester United midfield that was second best at Anfield Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has blasted Manchester United midfield Casemiro and claimed the Brazilian had his worst performance in a Red Devils shirt so far during Sunday's 7-0 defeat at Anfield

                United's over-reliance on Casemiro has been identified as a problem prior to Carragher's assessment and some fear the quality decline from the Brazilian to January signing and deputy Marcel Sabitzer is too steep for United to really mount a title tilt this term

                Liverpool hero Jamie Carragher did not hold back in his assessment of Casemiro after the Brazilian was at the heart of a Manchester United midfield that was second best at Anfield Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has blasted Manchester United midfield Casemiro and claimed the Brazilian had his worst performance in a Red Devils shirt so far during Sunday's 7-0 defeat at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second goal is the killer for United

                United's over-reliance on Casemiro has been identified as a problem prior to Carragher's assessment and some fear the quality decline from the Brazilian to January signing and deputy Marcel Sabitzer is too steep for United to really mount a title tilt this term

                Liverpool have learned how much it will cost to sign James Maddison in the summer if he continues to reject Leicester City's attempts to renew his contract.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Football Insider, Liverpool will need to pay £60m-£70m to sign Maddison this summer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool's midfield is lacking a player like Maddison, who is a double threat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He can score and assist with equal efficiency and would give Jurgen Klopp a different attacking threat than what he currently has on offer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given the lack of a playmaker in Liverpool's traditional midfield three, it's difficult to predict how Klopp would use Maddison.

            <p>
                By netting his 128th and 129th league goals for Liverpool against United, Salah finally achieved his dream and, as implausible as it may first appear may have designs on catching the likes of Ian Rush and Roger Hunt — who scored 244 and 229 times, respectively — in terms of all-time league strikes

                MANCHESTER UNITED reckon they can sign Harry Kane this summer, if Tottenham miss out on the top four

                In response to an oral question on the Parliament website today (March 6), the ministry said that the 3,227 one-off teachers included 2,621 permanent teachers and 606 teachers who were appointed on contract basis for placement in Sarawak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was in reply to a question from Ahmad Johnie Zawawi (GPS-Igan) on the number of one-off and contract teachers who did not report for work or had rejected the offer to teach in Sarawak and the steps taken by the ministry to fill the vacancies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the ministry, Sarawak-born teachers are given priority to be placed in the state based on vacancies available and subject options requirements

                The England youngster's first Premier League goal came in July 2020, when current manager Arteta was just a few months into his first season

                He has already bested his all-competitions record this season, though, and needs just three more to match his best single-season league return of 17

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two separate High Courts had allowed LHDN’s applications to enter summary judgments to recover tax arrears of RM1.69bil from Najib and RM37.6mil from Nazifuddin, respectively for the period between 2011 and 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A summary judgment is obtained when the court decides on a case, through written submissions, without a full trial and witnesses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Najib and Nazifuddin lost their appeals in the Court of Appeal in September 2021 to set aside the summary judgments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 10, last year, the Federal Court granted them leave to pursue their appeals to the Federal Court

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 — Former finance minister Lim Guan Eng today said the Cabinet had backed him on three proposals rejected by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, after the latter claimed the DAP leader could not “do anything” without his approval as the prime minister then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This was done by me three times during my tenure as finance minister (2018-2020) in securing Cabinet approval over and above the strident objections of then prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad,” Lim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On each of the three occasions that Mahathir was overruled by Cabinet, he threatened to sack me for defying him on these three initiatives,” Lim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mahathir did not carry out his threat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In it, Dr Mahathir claimed DAP had not been able to control him when he was the seventh prime minister as he had been more powerful at the time
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 — Former finance minister Lim Guan Eng today said the Cabinet had backed him on three proposals rejected by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, after the latter claimed the DAP leader could not “do anything” without his approval as the prime minister then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This was done by me three times during my tenure as finance minister (2018-2020) in securing Cabinet approval over and above the strident objections of then prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad,” Lim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On each of the three occasions that Mahathir was overruled by Cabinet, he threatened to sack me for defying him on these three initiatives,” Lim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mahathir did not carry out his threat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In it, Dr Mahathir claimed DAP had not been able to control him when he was the seventh prime minister as he had been more powerful at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>

                In his defence of the four assemblymen, Wan Saiful reminded that Penang’s former chief minister and DAP’s Bagan MP Lim Guan Eng, had on August 2022 said there was a need for the Penang state government to amend the State Constitution so that it is in line with the anti-party hopping law at federal level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “At the federal level, when an individual is sacked, or when a party leaves a coalition, that situation is not considered as party-hopping
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But the regulations in the Penang state government are not in-line with the aspirations at the federal level when two assemblymen in Penang from PN who never party-hopped, both contested under Bersatu, remained in Bersatu, but Bersatu left Pakatan Harapan (PH) and two more assemblymen were sacked from PKR, these two have never party-hopped as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The aspirations at the federal level have not been translated at the state level as the sacking and two more who remained in Bersatu has been considered as party-hopping in Penang,” he said expressing regret over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zulkifli and Dr Afif, who were both PKR members when they were elected, have since been sacked by the party while Khaliq and Zolkifly are still members of Bersatu, the same party they were part of during the 2018 state polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He cited Article 14A of the Penang Constitution, which stipulates that a member of the state legislative assembly shall vacate his seat if having been elected as a candidate of a political party, he resigns or is expelled from a party or having been elected otherwise than as a candidate of a political party, he joins a political party

                The Deputy Prime Minister said the Special Committee on Congestion at the Johor Causeway had agreed to the proposal in principle and the idea would be refined by the Home Ministry, as the secretariat of the special committee, before being tabled at the Cabinet meeting

                Aside from that, Fadillah revealed that a total of RM190mil had been allocated by the Federal Government to implement short-, medium- and long-term initiatives including to improve facilities and ease congestion at the Johor Causeway

            <p>
                The first step the group has implemented was the migration from using SMS one-time password (OTP) to face verification, which it developed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Slightly different from face verification done by others in the industry, in which they use a device to recognise the customer’s face to log in or do transactions, ours will detect the face based on the ‘selfie’ the customer uploaded in our server, pre-registration,” Ni explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, transactions of a certain threshold or any abnormal activity and suspicious behaviour observed on a user’s account will be limited or blocked and an email alert will be sent to the users if the transaction is over the set limit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The third step is the TapSecure feature and authentication of electronic banking transactions, which is now restricted to one mobile device or secure device per account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “TapSecure is now a mandatory one-tap approval function to authenticate users’ transactions and ensures that only a user’s linked device can be used for the approval of transactions within the user’s eWallet account,” Ni shared
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Cooling-off means that when users log in to their eWallet from a new device with a less secure authentication method, it will trigger a set of risk-based conditions where the user will be limited for a certain number of top-ups or payments for up to 48 hours,” he added

            <p>
                The first step the group has implemented was the migration from using SMS one-time password (OTP) to face verification, which it developed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Slightly different from face verification done by others in the industry, in which they use a device to recognise the customer’s face to log in or do transactions, ours will detect the face based on the ‘selfie’ the customer uploaded in our server, pre-registration,” Ni explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, transactions of a certain threshold or any abnormal activity and suspicious behaviour observed on a user’s account will be limited or blocked and an email alert will be sent to the users if the transaction is over the set limit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The third step is the TapSecure feature and authentication of electronic banking transactions, which is now restricted to one mobile device or secure device per account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “TapSecure is now a mandatory one-tap approval function to authenticate users’ transactions and ensures that only a user’s linked device can be used for the approval of transactions within the user’s eWallet account,” Ni shared
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Cooling-off means that when users log in to their eWallet from a new device with a less secure authentication method, it will trigger a set of risk-based conditions where the user will be limited for a certain number of top-ups or payments for up to 48 hours,” he added

                Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (pic) confirmed that he had not seen the letter from ROS regarding the approval of the additional motion of the Umno general assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Declining to comment further, Saifuddin said he would need time to “see” the letter in a few days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Saturday (March 4) Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said the party had received a letter from Saifuddin on Friday (March 3) regarding the ROS decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said on Sunday (March 5) that Umno will publish the letter from ROS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said he would ask the party’s secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan to see to this so that all members are reassured over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid, who is also Rural and Regional Development Minister, said it is hoped that the ROS letter would bring to an end any polemic against the motion that was approved during the 2022 Umno general assembly in January this year

                seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The firm’s search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, A$200 million (US$135.36 million) underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the Malaysian government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful

                According to Touch ‘n Go eWallet, they’re now the first and so far only eWallet in Malaysia to meet BNM’s security requirements, four months ahead of the June 2023 deadline set by BNM
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For starters, they’ve implemented face verification as a method of authentication when Touch ‘n Go eWallet users log into their eWallet app, change their eWallet PIN, perform transactions or make payments with their eWallet as well as when they reload into their eWallet account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Touch ‘n Go eWallet is also restricting the authentication of electronic banking transactions to just one mobile device or secure device per account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Touch ‘n Go eWallet believes this will ensure only a user’s linked device can be used for approval of transactions involving the user’s eWallet accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This cooling-off period will last for 48 hours, and triggers whenever a user logs into their Touch ‘n Go eWallet account from a new device with a less secure authentication method
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You’ll be able to reach Touch ‘n Go eWallet’s scam hotline at +60350223888 and select ‘4’ for ‘fraud’ to make a report with the platform

                According to Touch ‘n Go eWallet, they’re now the first and so far only eWallet in Malaysia to meet BNM’s security requirements, four months ahead of the June 2023 deadline set by BNM
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For starters, they’ve implemented face verification as a method of authentication when Touch ‘n Go eWallet users log into their eWallet app, change their eWallet PIN, perform transactions or make payments with their eWallet as well as when they reload into their eWallet account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Touch ‘n Go eWallet is also restricting the authentication of electronic banking transactions to just one mobile device or secure device per account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Touch ‘n Go eWallet believes this will ensure only a user’s linked device can be used for approval of transactions involving the user’s eWallet accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This cooling-off period will last for 48 hours, and triggers whenever a user logs into their Touch ‘n Go eWallet account from a new device with a less secure authentication method
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You’ll be able to reach Touch ‘n Go eWallet’s scam hotline at +60350223888 and select ‘4’ for ‘fraud’ to make a report with the platform

            <p>
                "If any question arises if a member of the state assembly has done so and a decision by the state assembly has been taken, it will be final," he said during the first day of the meeting held at the state assembly building in Light Street, George Town Penang on Monday (March 6)

                In 2020 the four assemblymen filed the suit to challenge the constitutionality of Article 14A(1) of the Penang State Constitution (PSC) and to stop their seats from being declared vacant, pursuant to Article 14A(1) but the Federal Court found that it was in line with the constitution

                With such an exciting change going on in the country, Liverpool and FSG would be smart to set up a scouting base in the region, with an eye on the next Salah.

                Ukrainian servicemen fire a 2S5 Giatsint-S self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops outside the frontline town of Bakhmut, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Donetsk region, Ukraine March 5, 2023

                For its part, the Russian Defence Ministry on Sunday said Russian forces had hit a command centre of the Ukrainian Azov Regiment in southeastern Zaporizhzhia region

            <p>
                Volodymyr Nazarenko, a commander of Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut, said that there had been no order to retreat and "the defence is holding" in grim conditions

                "The situation in Bakhmut can be described as critical," Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said in a video commentary

                As a result, there is a shortage of housing stock.  These are worrying times for the country’s real estate market, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) predicting further rate hikes in the coming months, said observers.  In Sydney, for instance, higher interest rates have sent prices falling by between 10 and 15 per cent since property values peaked more than a year ago

                The rise in interest rates is also affecting the broader economy, adding to Australia’s cost of living woes and stoking fears of a possible recession if the conditions do not improve.  The central bank is taking much of the blame for initially suggesting that interest rates in Australia would not go up until 2024

                Observers pointed out, however, that at the upper end of the property market, top-dollar homes with views, will continue to sell.  For example, a three-bedroom townhouse with its iconic views of the Sydney Harbour is tipped to fetch A$11 million (US$7.4 million) when it is put on auction soon.  A couple of years ago, it sold for about A$10 million (US$6.8 million)

                The government has earmarked US$140 billion that could include subsidising the purchase of domestically produced chipmaking equipment, Reuters reported in December, likely benefiting manufacturers such as China's sole semiconductor lithography specialist, Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Group (SMEE)

                SMEE has not made any major advancements since, in part due to difficulties in procuring equipment from abroad, the engineer told Reuters

                "Even if we could have built the machines, we wouldn't have known how to service and maintain them," the engineer said

            <p>
                The situation could be worsened for Chinese companies should Japan and the Netherlands agree with the United States to also restrict exports of chipmaking equipment to China

                Families of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously nine years ago, called on the government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane

            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane

            <p>
                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful

                Families of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously nine years ago, called on the government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane

            <p>
                The firm's search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, US$135.36 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful

            <p>
                Following Manchester United’s harrowing defeat last night at the hands of Liverpool, prata chain Srisun Express  is offering some consolation in the form of free prata for jilted Man U fans Srisun Express is giving out seven free prata to fans of the Red Devils who show up at any of their outlets donning a Man U jersey
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though you’ll get free prata, you’re also likely to become a target for schadenfreude from rival fans with your jersey
            </p>
            
            <p>

                The early talk ahead of the season was all about who would be the better addition out of Nunez and Erling Haaland after the Norwegian's £51m move to Manchester City
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Time and time again, Nunez has managed to get himself into great positions and all that has been missing was the final piece of quality.  A big part of the recent upturn in form for Nunez has been the arrival of Gakpo, who joined the Reds in January from PSV for £44m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, more importantly, the signing of Gakpo has allowed Nunez to move to his preferred position on the left, with the Dutchman operating down the centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Premier League games that Nunez has played on the left-side of attack, he has scored five times in seven matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez has also contributed a goal or assist every 103 minutes as supposed to every 125 minutes before the Dutchman pitched up at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With an impressive 14 goals in his debut season in English football, Nunez will no doubt be a part of this and he is beginning to show all the potential that resulted in Liverpool splashing out £85m on him in the summer

                FIFA has been urged by Football Australia, the co-host of the 2023 Women's World Cup, to reject an attempt by Visit Saudi -- Saudi Arabia's tourism body -- to become a major sponsor of this summer's tournament in Australia and New Zealand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although FIFA has yet to confirm that Visit Saudi will be announced as a tournament sponsor, recent reports have said that football's governing body has been in discussions with prominent figures in Saudi Arabia over a lucrative partnership deal for this year's World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Football Australia and New Zealand have sought clarification from FIFA, but with the issue still to be resolved, Football Australia CEO James Johnson has now put pressure on FIFA to abandon any plans to team up with Visit Saudi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "While we await further clarity and information as to the details of the partnership from FIFA, we continue to convey this clear message on behalf of Football Australia, New Zealand Football, and our community." Last month, leaders of the Australia and New Zealand national football federations wrote to FIFA to warn that signing the "Visit Saudi'' sponsorship could "severely tarnish the reputation'' of the tournament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leading players in the women's game have spoken out against the possible involvement of Visit Saudi, with United States international Alex Morgan describing the prospect of Saudi Arabian sponsorship as "bizarre." "I think it's bizarre that FIFA has looked to have a Visit Saudi sponsorship for the Women's World Cup, when I, myself, Alex Morgan, would not even be accepted and supported in that country," Morgan said

                Keita has attracted plenty of interest in the past year despite his Liverpool career not panning out as planned after a £52.75million transfer in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now as an upcoming free agent, interest remains in the Guinean but as a fringe player in his final year, Liverpool could have made use of him in potential transfer dealings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo's Sunday edition have claimed that Keita has attracted notable interest at Barcelona, who is one of several on the Catalan club’s agenda this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Dortmund and Barcelona have a reported interest in Keita, while Liverpool have been mentioned with two of their stars in Bellingham and Gavi who are long-term targets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reds’ top summer priority is Bellingham but face competition from the likes of United, Manchester City and Real Madrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, that possibility is now off the table with Keita leaving on a free at the end of the season, meaning Liverpool will have to dig into their pockets if they want to sign either Bellingham or Gavi in the summer

                Keita has attracted plenty of interest in the past year despite his Liverpool career not panning out as planned after a £52.75million transfer in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now as an upcoming free agent, interest remains in the Guinean but as a fringe player in his final year, Liverpool could have made use of him in potential transfer dealings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo's Sunday edition have claimed that Keita has attracted notable interest at Barcelona, who is one of several on the Catalan club’s agenda this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Dortmund and Barcelona have a reported interest in Keita, while Liverpool have been mentioned with two of their stars in Bellingham and Gavi who are long-term targets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reds’ top summer priority is Bellingham but face competition from the likes of United, Manchester City and Real Madrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, that possibility is now off the table with Keita leaving on a free at the end of the season, meaning Liverpool will have to dig into their pockets if they want to sign either Bellingham or Gavi in the summer
            </p>

                Ivory Coast footballer Moustapha Sylla, 21, has died after collapsing during a domestic league game on Sunday, with Chelsea legend Didier Drogba subsequently demanding that more must be done to protect the country's footballers

                Reacting to Sylla's death on Monday, former Ivory Coast striker and FIFA presidential hopeful Drogba called for more action to be done to protect the country's players
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Rest in peace, soldier," he posted on social media, with a photograph of the 21-year-old, while the Ivorian Federation offered its "saddest condolences to the family, as well as players and management of RCA, during these moments of pain and emotion." Left-back Sylla was previously on the books of Malian giants Djoliba AC, with whom he won the domestic title in 2022, before returning to his homeland with RCA in September.

                No mechanical changes, so the Leaf continues to be offered in the single battery capacity configuration previously available here

            <p>
                Recharging the 350 volt battery is via a Type 2 port (previously, Type 1), which is still located at the car’s nose – no change to the car’s onboard 6.6 kW AC charger, so it will again take approximately seven hours to fully charge the battery

                The 2023 Nissan Leaf facelift is priced at RM168,888 on-the-road without insurance

                For the same price, Atto 3 has 50% more kWh capacity than Leaf

                Deputy Minister of Finance I Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan told the Dewan Rakyat that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, who is also the finance minister, has instructed banking institutions to undertake their CSR programmes as a form of aid to help the B40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deputy minister noted that the government does not impose any windfall tax on banks which remained profitable during the pandemic period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That is also a form of aid to the people, which will be announced possibly during the Minister of Finance’s winding up speech for the policy stage of revised Budget 2023 debate, on the required CSR [programmes] by profitable banks to help the people,” said Ahmad on Monday (March 6)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad was responding to a question by former Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal [Warisan-Semporna], who asked whether the government would impose any windfall tax on financial institutions which recorded substantial profits during the pandemic period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Bank Negara Malaysia did not benefit [when overnight policy rate (OPR) increased], it was those financial institutions that benefited,” said Shafie

            <p>
                In this regard, Ahmad said not all borrowers are affected by the increase in OPR because the increase to monthly instalments only involves loans with floating interest rates

                In his defence of the four assemblymen, Wan Saiful reminded that Penang’s former chief minister and DAP’s Bagan MP Lim Guan Eng, had on August 2022 said there was a need for the Penang state government to amend the State Constitution so that it is in line with the anti-party hopping law at federal level

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But the regulations in the Penang state government are not in-line with the aspirations at the federal level when two assemblymen in Penang from PN who never party-hopped, both contested under Bersatu, remained in Bersatu, but Bersatu left Pakatan Harapan (PH) and two more assemblymen were sacked from PKR, these two have never party-hopped as well

            <p>
                “The aspirations at the federal level have not been translated at the state level as the sacking and two more who remained in Bersatu has been considered as party-hopping in Penang,” he said expressing regret over the matter

                Zulkifli and Dr Afif, who were both PKR members when they were elected, have since been sacked by the party while Khaliq and Zolkifly are still members of Bersatu, the same party they were part of during the 2018 state polls

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, March 5 — Communications and Digital minister Fahmi Fadzil today said he has met with social engagement centre O2 Malaysia, which ran a recent survey critical of the government after conducting a survey of its first 100 days in power
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The O2 survey said about 71 per cent of Malay respondents in peninsular Malaysia were dissatisfied with the new government’s fulfilment of the 15th general election manifesto
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However it was published before March 4 when the government hit its 100 days and had a sample of 80 per cent male respondents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fahmi questioned the motive behind the survey which was conducted via five news organisations to commemorate the 100 days of Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s administration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It had among others said that 71 per cent of Malay respondents in peninsular Malaysia were dissatisfied with the new government’s fulfilment of the 15th general election manifesto, and only 45 per cent of respondents felt the country was moving in the right direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A counter-survey released by consumer research technology company Vase.ai yesterday said just 23 per cent of its Malay respondents from peninsular Malaysia disapproved of Anwar Ibrahim as prime minister

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, March 5 — Communications and Digital minister Fahmi Fadzil today said he has met with social engagement centre O2 Malaysia, which ran a recent survey critical of the government after conducting a survey of its first 100 days in power
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The O2 survey said about 71 per cent of Malay respondents in peninsular Malaysia were dissatisfied with the new government’s fulfilment of the 15th general election manifesto
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However it was published before March 4 when the government hit its 100 days and had a sample of 80 per cent male respondents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fahmi questioned the motive behind the survey which was conducted via five news organisations to commemorate the 100 days of Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s administration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It had among others said that 71 per cent of Malay respondents in peninsular Malaysia were dissatisfied with the new government’s fulfilment of the 15th general election manifesto, and only 45 per cent of respondents felt the country was moving in the right direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A counter-survey released by consumer research technology company Vase.ai yesterday said just 23 per cent of its Malay respondents from peninsular Malaysia disapproved of Anwar Ibrahim as prime minister

            <p>

                Brandt has long been linked with a move to the Premier League leaders over the past few years, but he has remained loyal to Dortmund since joining from Bayer Leverkusen in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dortmund could therefore come under pressure to sell Brandt this summer before he walks away for nothing in 2024, and he would seemingly not be short of suitors amid an eye-catching season for Edin Terzic's side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to German outlet Bild, Arsenal remain attentive to Brandt's situation and could make a move for the German this summer if he opts not to renew his Dortmund contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report states that Brandt would welcome a change of scenery at this stage of his career, and he has informed his entourage that he would be interested in a move to the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since joining for a €25m (£22.1m) fee from Leverkusen in the summer of 2019, Brandt has made 158 appearances for Dortmund in all tournaments, scoring 29 goals and setting up 30 more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While adept in the number 10 role, Brandt has recently been deployed as a winger - an area where Arsenal may be looking for additional cover in the summer transfer window

            <p>
                The back of the Huawei badge refers to the use of local-area radio systems to aid tracking, it says “We use RFID and Bluetooth tech to collect the swipe time of this Huawei Card at the entrance of Huawei exhibition area, real-time location information and the residence time of visitors

                The United States and South Korea will conduct more than 10 days of large-scale military exercises in March, including amphibious landings, officials from the two countries said on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US and South Korea say the exercises are in self-defence and are necessary to counter the rising threats from North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes, which are banned by UN Security Council resolutions

            <p>
                North Korea on Saturday blamed the United States for what it said was the collapse of international arms control systems and said Pyongyang's nuclear weapons were a just response to ensure the balance of power in the region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The UN and the international community will have to strongly urge the US and South Korea to immediately halt their provocative remarks and joint military exercises," Kim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last month Kim issued a statement saying UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has been "extremely unfair, unbalanced" on North Korea's missile tests.

                According to these reports, the Proton X90 will be a mild hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MHEV hybrid system is expected to be a 1.5 litre three-cylinder 48V engine+motor combo producing 190 PS at 5,500 rpm and 300 Nm of torque from 1,500-4,000 rpm, which is higher than the 177 PS, 255 Nm non-hybrid version of the engine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Firstly, Proton has already exhibited this engine at Proton’s Centre of Excellence showroom in Shah Alam back in November 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How does the Proton X90’s 48V hybrid system work?  The system takes the regular 3-cylinder 1.5 litre turbocharged engine and adds a number of components to it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hybrid system can provide 13 horsepower and 45 Nm of assist, which is what brings the 177 PS, 255 Nm numbers of the non-hybrid up to 190 PS and 300 Nm in the hybrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since it’s called a ‘mild’ hybrid system, the capabilities are also modest

                Raphael Varane has played an important role in Manchester United's revival under Erik ten Hag but could miss their upcoming Premier League clash against Liverpool  Raphael Varane will have a late fitness test ahead of Manchester United's Premier League trip to Liverpool on Sunday afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag is expected to give Harry Maguire the nod if Varane is not fit, with Lisandro Martinez set to continue at left-centre-back

            <p>
                Ten Hag's preferred centre-back partnership is Varane on the right and Martinez on the left
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Dutchman likes his right-centre-back to be right-footed, which means club captain Maguire or fellow defender Victor Lindelof are Varane's obvious deputies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Varane is United's most experienced centre-back after winning the World Cup with France and the Champions League four times with Real Madrid

                Raphael Varane has played an important role in Manchester United's revival under Erik ten Hag but could miss their upcoming Premier League clash against Liverpool  Raphael Varane will have a late fitness test ahead of Manchester United's Premier League trip to Liverpool on Sunday afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag is expected to give Harry Maguire the nod if Varane is not fit, with Lisandro Martinez set to continue at left-centre-back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag's preferred centre-back partnership is Varane on the right and Martinez on the left
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Dutchman likes his right-centre-back to be right-footed, which means club captain Maguire or fellow defender Victor Lindelof are Varane's obvious deputies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Varane is United's most experienced centre-back after winning the World Cup with France and the Champions League four times with Real Madrid
            </p>
            
            <p>

                AC Milan and Chelsea could do some more business together this summer, if the latest reports are to be believed

                Manchester City are reportedly willing to let Bernardo Silva leave the club in the summer, with Barcelona still interested in landing the Portugal international
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A report in Spanish publication Sport claims that while Silva wants a pay rise to stay at City, that has led to the club to try and cash in on the playmaker who still has over two years left on his current deal

                The report also adds that Silva is interested in joining Xavi’s Barcelona project, although wages could be an issue for the Catalan club

                Kylian Mbappe has reached another landmark in his already record-laden career, surpassing Edinson Cavani as Paris Saint-Germain's all-time top scorer with his 201st goal against Nantes in Ligue 1 on Saturday
            </p>

                Graham Potter speaks after Chelsea's 1-0 win over Leeds in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, even if Saturday's win was less than spectacular, it transformed Potter's post-match demeanour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It's a big win," a beaming Potter told reporters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It's really good for the players to win and to keep a clean sheet," Potter said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                as we prepare for a massive game on Tuesday." Chelsea face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League round of 16 on Tuesday, needing to claw back a 1-0 deficit from the first leg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will need to step up a gear to do that but Potter believes Saturday's goal can be the start of many

                Fred is enjoying his best season at Manchester United despite a reduction in his minutes Erik ten Hag has shown how to get the best out of Fred and get the most out of his strengths The signing of Casemiro has been particularly influential in helping Fred improve this season Ten Hag's arrival at the club raised the question of whether Fred had a future at the club - talk which heightened after United lost their first two matches of the season  with a 2-1 loss to Brighton and a 4-0 thumping by Brentford - both of which the Brazilian started and struggled.  Following the loss to Brentford, Fred started just two league games before January's 2-1 victory over rivals Man City.   But that doesn't tell the full story as Fred has often been Ten Hag's go-to player off the bench, improving after being given reduced on-field responsibilities and a clearer role.   He has played a bigger part since the World Cup, registering five goals - including a vital finish in their Europa League victory over Barcelona - and three assists in that time.  In the 20 matches he's played since the return of domestic football, he's started ten games

                Though it should be noted that Christian Eriksen's injury has opened the door for Fred to reclaim a place in the starting XI.  But now as a starter, Fred looks more comfortable now that he has that defensive rock alongside him in Casemiro

                Kia is about to release a new fully-electric SUV that’s called the EV9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similar to its current EV6, the Kia EV9 is based on the Hyundai-Kia group’s E-GMP platform which uses an 800V electrical architecture
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The full design of the Kia EV6 will be unveiled on 15th March 2023 and the Korean carmaker has dropped a couple of video teasers of its design and lighting effects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In terms of size, you can expect it to be as large as the Kia Telluride, a model that’s a class above the current Kia Sorento
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since Hyundai and Kia are from the same group, the EV9’s closest cousin will be the upcoming Ioniq 7 which was showcased as the Concept “Seven”
            </p>

                Two Ferrari supercars were involved in a serious accident in Italy on March 4, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The incident was captured on video, posted by SupercarsNews, which you can see embedded atop this page

            <p>
                According to a report by Italy 24 News, the accident occurred around noon in Osimo, a town in the province of Ancona, Italy

            <p>
                According to local police, the accident may have been caused by excessive speed, which you can also see on the CCTV footage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the video, you can see the red Ferrari going off the road at a bend first, followed closely by the blue one, which flew into the air before colliding against the fence of a house and catching fire
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The firefighters of the Osimo detachment and the Ancona power plant also responded to the scene to extinguish the fire that engulfed the blue Ferrari

                In order to prove a prima facie case for Najib to defend himself, the prosecution would have to prove all elements of the Section 23(1) charge against him, namely that Najib was an officer of a public body and that he used his office for “gratification”

            <p>

                When he moved to Juventus in January 2022, he had interest from other big names, namely Arsenal and Tottenham

                Indeed, the forward is the subject of renewed interest from Arsenal, as well as from Manchester United and Chelsea

                Indeed, they state Juventus value Vlahovic at no less than €100million (approx £88.5million)

            </p>
            
            <p>
                United will have a keen eye on Juventus’ movements to see if the move is possible in the summer

                15726  A court ruling has sided with former SM executive producer Lee Soo Man in the provisional injunction against SM Entertainment issuing new shares and convertible bonds

                The plan for Kakao Entertainment to become the second largest shareholder through the allocation of new shares and CBs has been put to a sudden halt with the latest court decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court explained, "It is difficult to conclude that the company needed to allocate and issue new shares and convertible bonds to Kakao in order to achieve management objectives such as urgent financing, business expansion, and strategic alliance in this case without the existing shareholders' warrants for new shares."  On the same day, HYBE made an official statement stating, "As the largest shareholder of SM, we respect the court's decision to quote the provisional injunction, and we thank the Seoul Eastern District Court for making the right decision."  HYBE continued, "Through this decision, illegal attempts by SM's current management to influence the company's governance will be clearly stopped, and everything will now fall back into place

                Their plan was not well thought out (and actually illegal) and to their dismay, LSM was able to almost immediately derail it by selling his shares to HYBE

                No matter what, for better or worse, SME is entering a new "season" with a new cast of players

                About Us Advertise NEW YORK, March 4 — US prosecutors yesterday urged a judge to sentence former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng to 15 years in prison after he was convicted of helping loot billions of dollars from Malaysia’s 1MDB sovereign wealth fund
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A jury in Brooklyn federal court had last April found Ng, Goldman’s former head of investment banking in Malaysia, guilty of helping his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from the fund, launder the proceeds and bribe government officials to win business
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leissner had been Goldman’s Southeast Asia chief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                US District Judge Margo Brodie is expected to sentence Ng on March 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge
            </p>

                Leissner pleaded guilty and testified against Ng as part of a cooperation agreement

                Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case for Najib to answer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When met after the High Court’s decision, deputy public prosecutor Kamal Baharin Omar confirmed to reporters that the prosecution would study the grounds of judgment and would refer the matter to the attorney general to decide on whether an appeal would be filed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) almost always notify the court that they would appeal after losing a criminal trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The filing of a notice for appeal would be done even before the grounds of judgement had been given, added Apandi

            <p>
                Following the filing of the notice of appeal, the court would have to make a signed copy of the grounds of decision in the case and cause it to be served upon the AGC if the public prosecutor is the appellant

            <p>
                The public therefore can expect the AGC to appeal because it is “almost automatic”, more so when the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case at the end of its own case

            <p>
                “The current value of the damaged and destroyed capital stock is estimated at about 10 percent of GDP,“ said the World Bank in its latest estimate

            <p>
                A subsequent earthquake on February 20 caused added damage, and continued aftershocks are likely to add to damage estimates over time, said the World Bank

            <p>
                “These losses compound years of destruction, suffering and hardship the people of Syria have been enduring,“ said Jean-Christophe Carret, World Bank country director for the Middle East department

                Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case for Najib to answer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When met after the High Court’s decision, deputy public prosecutor Kamal Baharin Omar confirmed to reporters that the prosecution would study the grounds of judgment and would refer the matter to the attorney general to decide on whether an appeal would be filed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) almost always notify the court that they would appeal after losing a criminal trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The filing of a notice for appeal would be done even before the grounds of judgement had been given, added Apandi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the filing of the notice of appeal, the court would have to make a signed copy of the grounds of decision in the case and cause it to be served upon the AGC if the public prosecutor is the appellant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only then would the AGC be in possession of the full grounds of decision for it to study the grounds given by the trial judge, and then decide whether to proceed or not with the appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The public therefore can expect the AGC to appeal because it is “almost automatic”, more so when the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case at the end of its own case

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 — Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Tim Leissner was ordered to forfeit US$43.7 million in cash and US$3.3 million worth of shares in fitness drink company Celsius Holdings Inc

                Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino will depart the Reds at the end of the season at the end of his contract
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                But Gazzetta also reports that Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid are interested in Firmino, and journalist Jorge Nicola claimed on YouTube (in December, via Sport Witness) that Brazilian club Corinthians could even be an option
            </p>

                The latest transfer rumours featuring Harry Maguire, Scott McTominay and Anthony Martial reports

            <p>
                United resisted any urge to sell in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United are open to selling Martial in order to generate funds for a new striker - with Victor Osimhen and Harry Kane being monitored
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The article from Football Insider claims that Moyes admires Maguire, McTominay and Martial as he strives to strengthen his squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, there is no indication as to what Maguire and Martial might cost the Hammers

                “This can ensure that both shariah savings and conventional savings have a more optimal, competitive and sustainable long-term return,” he said at a press conference after the EPF’s financial performance briefing here today

            <p>
                He said the separation allows the EPF to set a percentage limit for each desired investment, and not because investments in shariah savings are not halal

                Bumiputera EPF members saw a whopping 70% drop in median savings to RM4,900 as at December 2022, from RM15,500 as at April 2020, while Indian EPF members’ median savings declined 40% to RM14,900 from RM25,700 during the same period, said EPF chief executive officer Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan at a media briefing to announce the fund's 2022 financial performance on Saturday (March 4)

                In terms of income groups, Amir Hamzah said the median savings of EPF members in the bottom 40% group (B40) were hit the most, falling 70% to RM577 as at December 2022, from RM2,434 as at April 2020
            </p>

                The B40 and M40 had 5.2 million members each contributing to the fund, while the T20 had 2.3 million EPF members

                In a Facebook post on Friday (March 3) evening, MRT Corp said commuters can travel all the way from Kwasa Damansara to Putrajaya Sentral (and vice versa) beginning at 3pm on March 16

            <p>
                The Putrajaya Line, formerly known as the Sungai Buloh-Serdang-Putrajaya (SSP) line, runs through 36 stations to complete what is known as Klang Valley's second MRT line

            <p>
                With its full opening, it will be possible to get to KLIA and KLIA2 from downtown Kuala Lumpur for less than RM15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This can be done by taking the MRT to Putrajaya Sentral, with the fare expected to cost only a few ringgit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From Putrajaya Sentral, one can transfer over to the KLIA Transit, a service that is part of the Express Rail Line (ERL), with a one-way fare to either KLIA or KLIA2 costing only RM9.40

                He said the policies would take into account the economic slowdown in 2023, citing a predicted smaller growth of the global economy at 2.9 per cent compared to 3.4 per cent last year

                Earlier during the day, the counter had gained 20.5 sen or 31.3% to an intra-day high of 86 sen, briefly breaching LTAT’s offer price of 85.5 sen apiece to purchase the Boustead shares it does not already own
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At 85.5 sen, the group is valued at RM1.72 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The drugmaker’s share price ended 2.5 sen or 10% higher at 27.5 sen, valuing the company at RM353.38 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spike in Boustead’s share price comes after LTAT made a voluntary takeover offer on Tuesday (March 2) to acquire the remaining 822.51 million Boustead shares or 40.58% stake it does not own at 85.5 sen apiece ― or a cumulative RM703.25 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the offer notice, LTAT shared that it does not intend to maintain Boustead’s listing status
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides Pharmaniaga, Boustead also owns a 64.99% stake in Boustead Heavy Industrial Corp Bhd (BHIC), a 57.42% stake in Boustead Plantations Bhd and a 20.93% stake in Affin Bank Bhd.  LTAT noted that the takeover offer on Boustead will not result in a mandatory offer to acquire all remaining voting shares in Pharmaniaga, BHIC, Boustead Plantations and Affin Bank, in view that it already has statutory control over Boustead

                Earlier during the day, the counter had gained 20.5 sen or 31.3% to an intra-day high of 86 sen, briefly breaching LTAT’s offer price of 85.5 sen apiece to purchase the Boustead shares it does not already own
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At 85.5 sen, the group is valued at RM1.72 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The drugmaker’s share price ended 2.5 sen or 10% higher at 27.5 sen, valuing the company at RM353.38 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spike in Boustead’s share price comes after LTAT made a voluntary takeover offer on Tuesday (March 2) to acquire the remaining 822.51 million Boustead shares or 40.58% stake it does not own at 85.5 sen apiece ― or a cumulative RM703.25 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the offer notice, LTAT shared that it does not intend to maintain Boustead’s listing status
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides Pharmaniaga, Boustead also owns a 64.99% stake in Boustead Heavy Industrial Corp Bhd (BHIC), a 57.42% stake in Boustead Plantations Bhd and a 20.93% stake in Affin Bank Bhd.  LTAT noted that the takeover offer on Boustead will not result in a mandatory offer to acquire all remaining voting shares in Pharmaniaga, BHIC, Boustead Plantations and Affin Bank, in view that it already has statutory control over Boustead

            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Feb 21, the MACC, with the cooperation of other agencies, busted an investment syndicate masterminded by British citizens following 24 raids and the arrest of 81 suspects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The modus operandi for the syndicate was to offer fake investment portfolios through advertisements on social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The syndicate members were from Australia, Britain, South Africa and the Philippines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is believed the syndicate was part of an international scam ring that duped victims of about RM1bil in total

            <p>
                Prior to the 1982 general election, he accepted former DAP’s secretary-general Lim Kit Siang's challenge to contest in a Chinese-majority constituency and won against the former DAP’s chairman Chen Man Hin in his Seremban stronghold
            </p>

                He started off his political career by joining MCA in 1957 and went on to win the Klang Utara parliamentary seat in the 1959 general election and became the youngest MP in the country at the age of 24
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lee dramatically retired from politics at the height of his political career by resigning from the Cabinet on March 24, 1983 and relinquishing his position as the president of MCA the next day for unspecified reasons

                The former statesman however explained in 2000 to Asiaweek that he was "stabbed in the back” by Umno leaders in the 1982 election.

                If the SEA Games is held in Cambodia, the kickboxing event name must be called Kun Khmer, and if it is held in Thailand, the event name must be called Muay Thai," Hun Sen said
