                Now is not a good time to be working in Britain’s car industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it is the announcement of several thousand job losses at Ford that will send the biggest shockwaves through the global car sector – 3,800 in total, 2,300 of which will come in Germany, 1,300 in the UK, and the remaining 200 across the rest of Europe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the central premises of net zero is that the resulting job destruction in old industries such as car-making, but also oil and gas exploration, construction and farming, will be more than offset by the job creation in green industries such as renewable energy – but if the remarks of Ford Germany’s boss Martin Sander are anything to go by, that looks doubtful at best
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are moving into a world with less [sic] global platforms where less engineering work is necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is why we have to make the adjustments.” Ford’s intervention is particularly significant because it is possible to extrapolate from the latest round of job cuts and arrive at an approximate figure for the industry as a whole as it goes electric
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But having been a late adopter, Ford is now among those leading the charge with a pledge to boost spending on electric vehicles to $50bn (£41bn), from $30bn previously, by 2026 and run its electric car unit separately from its legacy combustion engine operations, in a move aimed at catching trailblazer Tesla

                Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc cut its holding of TSMC’s American depositary receipts by 86% last quarter, according to the latest filing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TSMC had jumped in November amid news that Buffett had acquired a stake worth about US$5 billion, and it’s still up more than 40% from an October low
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The chip industry has had to contend with Covid-induced supply disruptions in China and a slump in demand for electronics amid surging inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TSMC cut its spending target by about 10% in 2022 to about US$36 billion after the Biden administration slapped new restrictions on China’s access to critical technologies

            <p>
                Late last year appeared to be a good time to buy TSMC shares as a value investor

            <p>
                While the stock will likely suffer near term on news of Buffett’s selldown, TSMC’s longer term outlook is still positive, according to Taishin Securities’ Huang

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 15 — Several retailer groups and a tourism association today urged Tourism, Arts, and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing to reconsider a blanket ban that effectively stops tour operators from listing shopping as part of the itinerary

                The groups are the Malaysia Retailers Association; the Bumiputera Retailers Organisation; the Bukit Bintang-KLCC Tourism Association Kuala Lumpur; the Batu Road Retailers Association; the Malaysia Retail Chain Association; the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association; and a trade coalition of 123 businesses called Industries Unite

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 15 — The trial of Lim Guan Eng for the Penang undersea tunnel project at the Sessions Court here has been suspended today so that the defence can get notes from a separate court proceeding that could exonerate the former chief minister of purportedly receiving RM2 million in bribes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim’s counsel Gobind Singh Deo told the court that the defence had filed an application to get the notes of proceedings from another Sessions Court in Shah Alam, Selangor on February 9 which was still pending
            </p>

                Today, Gobind once again reiterated the defence's stance, claiming there was 'abuse of power through suppression of evidence by the prosecution', further noting the necessity of having the notes of proceedings from the other court as proof

                It’s just as well, then, that the car can also accept up to 200 kW of DC fast charging power, which can fill the battery up from 10 to 80% in 31 minutes

                Cody Gakpo scored his first goal for Liverpool in Monday's Merseyside derby victory which preceded a grovelling apology from Pep Guardiola over comments that he made about Steven Gerrard's infamous slip in 2014 Liverpool fans had to wait nearly a month-and-a-half for their first Premier League victory of 2023, which made Monday's Merseyside derby triumph that bit sweeter

                Mohamed Salah finished off a ferocious counter attack to give Jurgen Klopp's side a half-time advantage, before Cody Gakpo netted a simple tap-in for his first Liverpool goal

                In yet another significant milestone for Mercedes-Benz Malaysia (MBM), the company today officially announced that the Mercedes-Benz Pekan production plant has begun to roll out Mercedes EQ all-electric vehicles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This particular facility which has been in operation for the past 19 years has rolled out more than 100,000 Mercedes-Benz vehicles to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While one may though that the first rollout of Malaysian-made EQ vehicles would be the entry-level EQA, that isn’t the case at all
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, the first EQ model to be assembled in Pekan is the flagship executive sedan EQS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This made Pekan as the third oversea Mercedes-Benz assembly facility to work on EQS after Pune in India and Thailand’s Samut Prakan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only that, the variant that Mercedes-Benz chose as the first Made-In-Pekan EQ model is the EQS 500 4MATIC which is a more powerful model than the fully imported EQS 450+ that was launched in Malaysia last year

                JPJ director-general Datuk Zailani Hashim said the improvements included introducing third-level security using the last eight characters on the back of users’ driver’s licence for online JPJeID registration

            <p>

            <p>
                According to Zailani, the improvements were implemented in response to feedback from the public on the use of the MyJPJ application and the JPJ public portal, following the introduction of the digital Motor Vehicle Licence (e-LKM) and digital Malaysian Driving Licence (e-LMM)

                It is true that the sight of Liverpool, having rode their luck in their own box just moments before, surging forward on the counter-attack for their first goal last night brought back memories of 2017-18 when Jürgen Klopp first unleashed his famous front three of Sadio Mane, Firmino and Salah

                Of course, Gakpo showed signs last night that he can operate in a false nine role akin to what Firmino has for Liverpool but, given Klopp’s desire for his players to be comfortable in a variety of positions, this tweak to the Dutchman’s role doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility

            <p>

                A woman was reportedly scolded by a medical worker for being "indecently dressed" while seeking treatment at the hospital in the 11pm incident on Sunday (Feb 12)

                Sivanesan said while he was not saying anyone was at fault over the dress code kerfuffle at Kampar Hospital, people should dress appropriately when seeking treatment at government clinics or hospitals

            <p>
                "I am not saying what the hospital did is correct and I (still) need to investigate (the incident)," he said, adding that all hospitals, including private ones, have the discretion to set a dress code

                Singapore’s Straits Times reports that a psychiatric patient in Selayang Hospital – upset about being stranded in the emergency room along with dozens of others as all wards were full – stabbed another patient earlier today, causing serious injuries

                KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 14 – A patient was seriously injured after getting stabbed by a psychiatric patient today in Selayang Hospital, as the latter was allegedly upset at being stranded in the overcrowded emergency department

            <p>
                Singapore’s The Straits Times reported that all the wards at the public hospital in Selangor were full at the time of the incident and that dozens were waiting in the emergency room

                One of the doctors interviewed by CodeBlue said that patients are stranded in the emergency department of Selayang Hospital, a tertiary Ministry of Health (MOH) hospital, for between 24 and 72 hours

                Johor Chief Minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi and Singapore Transport Minister S Iswaran, who is also the country's Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, meeting during Mr Onn Hafiz's three-day visit to Singapore on Feb 14, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said at that time that the terminal is a key international entry point that increases access for tourists to come to Johor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Onn Hafiz said that last year, more than 141,000 tourists came from Batam and Tanjung Balai in Indonesia to Puteri terminal via ferry services owned and operated by Malaysia property developer UEM Sunrise.  Mr Onn Hafiz on Tuesday also shared other points of discussions between him and Mr Iswaran.  He said both of them agreed that the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link was a priority for both countries.  “I agree with his suggestion to closely monitor the project's development, and to set short term and medium term goals so that the project continues to be on track,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  The cross-border rail project aims to connect Bukit Chagar in Johor Bahru city to Woodlands in Singapore, serving about 10,000 passengers per hour each way to help ease traffic congestion on the Causeway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is scheduled to be operational by end-2026.  Mr Onn Hafiz also reiterated a commitment he said was made recently by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to increase motorcycle lanes at the immigration complex in Bangunan Sultan Iskandar, which is linked to the Woodlands Causeway.  “It is generally known that the Johor-Singapore Causeway is one of the busiest land crossings in the world, with more than 300,000 Malaysians commuting daily from Johor Bahru to work in Singapore,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  The Machap state assemblyman added that he shared Mr Anwar’s willingness to see through a proposal to widen the lanes of the Johor portion of the North-South Highway.  “If this proposal is implemented, for sure it will benefit the business community in Singapore who wish to invest in Malaysia,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  “I once again express the willingness of the Johor State Government to foster future collaborations between Johor-Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This close ties is significant for both parties,” he added.  Tuesday was the last day of Mr Onn Hafiz’s three-day working visit to Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides Mr Iswaran, he also met with other Singapore leaders like Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan as well as Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman.  The chief minister also held meetings with business leaders as well as foreign corporations based in Singapore.  He said in a statement on Sunday that these companies were potential investors that could rake in between RM10 to RM15 billion (US$2.3 to US$3.45 billion) for the southern state and bring high paying jobs for Johoreans.  “The state government, with the help of the federal government, is committed to be facilitators and prepare utilities and infrastructure, to ensure a friendly business environment for investors across the world,” he added.

                Research Perodua Cars at  Comments Some people who will buy the new Axia will then be stunned at the running costs just going to state the obvious, but if you have to take a 9 year loan to be able to afford a car, it means you can’t afford the car

                Anthony Loke said that road users looking to register for a digital road tax would soon have to input the unique code located behind their driving licence in addition to their IC number during registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that he has discussed this thoroughly with JPJ and the system update will likely roll out soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said the new registration requirement would only apply to those that have yet to register through the JPJ app or website and that existing users would not be required to comply with the new requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the digitalisation of road tax would remain voluntary and there would be no mandate yet on forcing all road users to register into the system

                Anthony Loke said that road users looking to register for a digital road tax would soon have to input the unique code located behind their driving licence in addition to their IC number during registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that he has discussed this thoroughly with JPJ and the system update will likely roll out soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said the new registration requirement would only apply to those that have yet to register through the JPJ app or website and that existing users would not be required to comply with the new requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the digitalisation of road tax would remain voluntary and there would be no mandate yet on forcing all road users to register into the system

                Last Sunday, Zambry announced that the coalition would support Hajiji’s government and also named Yakub Khan as the coalition’s liaison in negotiations with GRS, effectively sidelining Sabah BN and Umno chief Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin

                The move saw both Bung and Yakub losing their posts in the state Cabinet.

                The self-employed suspects, aged 63 and 40 years old, respectively, were detained in Muar, Johor, while the 44-year-old contractor was detained at the MACC office here on Monday (Feb 13)

                Puteri Sarah filed for leave to initiate committal proceedings against Ira, whose full name is Faghira Fatini, her sister Yasmin, and Kazaruddin over an alleged breach of a court injunction following the revelation of Ira's marriage to Puteri Sarah's husband, actor and director Syamsul Yusof, last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the leave application filed on Jan 31, Puteri Sarah, whose full name is Puteri Sarah Liyana Megat Kamaruddin, claimed that the three defendants had committed contempt of court when they voluntarily violated an inter-parte injunction order dated July 4 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The injunction order was part of a lawsuit filed by Puteri Sarah in June, after she claimed she was on the receiving end of a barrage of harassment and threats from Ira, 27, via social media

            <p>

            <p>
                On Jan 16, Puteri Sarah filed for divorce from Syamsul after almost nine years of marriage

                Puteri Sarah also stated that she and her children no longer lived with Syamsul, either at her in-laws’ house or at their matrimonial home in Taman Melawati

                The arrest of controversial online influencer Andrew Tate's for alleged rape and human trafficking in Romania has shone a spotlight on the country's burgeoning sexcam industry

                “The Tate brothers are not known in the industry and have never participated in industry events,” said Maria Boroghina, a manager at Best Studios, one of Romania’s biggest sexcam operators

                Nur Shahirah Choo Fui Tze Chen, 40 who is now heavily pregnant, pleaded guilty to the charge after it was read to her before magistrate Mohamad Ibrahim Mohammad Ghulam

                Climate action towards decarbonisation goal does not match words
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A report titled "The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor" exposes the climate action faultlines.     Despite net-zero pledges made by some of the world’s largest corporations that speak up for efforts to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 36 per cent, only five of 24 companies’ actions represent a commitment to deep decarbonisation in reality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The companies analysed in the study have put themselves forward as climate leaders.  Overall, the study found the climate strategies of 15 of the 24 companies to be of low or very low integrity.  Most of the companies’ strategies do not represent examples of good practice climate leadership, it said, and added companies’ climate change commitments often do not add up to what their pledges might suggest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Companies’ climate pledges for 2030 fall well short of the required ambition and are inappropriately verified
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The authors found that most of these companies’ future net-zero goals and current climate claims are “exaggerated, false, and misleading”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Overall, the net-zero pledges of the 24 companies translate to a commitment to reduce just 36% of the companies’ combined GHG emission footprint, by the respective net-zero target years.

                The companies analysed in the study have put themselves forward as climate leaders.  Overall, the study found the climate strategies of 15 of the 24 companies to be of low or very low integrity.  Most of the companies’ strategies do not represent examples of good practice climate leadership, it said, and added companies’ climate change commitments often do not add up to what their pledges might suggest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Companies’ climate pledges for 2030 fall well short of the required ambition and are inappropriately verified
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The authors found that most of these companies’ future net-zero goals and current climate claims are “exaggerated, false, and misleading”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Overall, the net-zero pledges of the 24 companies translate to a commitment to reduce just 36% of the companies’ combined GHG emission footprint, by the respective net-zero target years.

                About Us Advertise     MICHIGAN, Feb 14 ― At least three people were killed and five injured after a gunman opened fire at Michigan State University last night, as law enforcement swarmed the main campus in East Lansing searching for a lone suspect, police said

                Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said Malaysia is seriously looking into policies that will support energy sectors to ensure that the EV ecosystem is complete and fully supported, including standards, certification and verification related to charging systems and battery disposal activities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Opportunities abound in the areas of renewable energy (RE), energy efficiency, energy storage systems, and support services for EVs, such as EV charging stations, operation and maintenance,” he said in his keynote address at Malaysia’s EV Conference 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To capitalise on the EV market, Tengku Zafrul said the government will also strengthen Malaysia’s Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the government has made a firm commitment to strategically develop the automotive industry, particularly the EV industry, as part of the zero greenhouse gas (GHG) target by 2050
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the shift to RE sources and electric transportation is a significant step towards Malaysia’s commitment to net-zero GHG by 2050, as outlined in the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (12MP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tengku Zafrul added that under the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021-2030, Malaysia aims to have EVs and hybrid to account for at least 15 per cent of the total industry volume (TIV) by 2030

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 14 — Malaysia is taking steps to strengthen its position through various policy measures, leveraging the existing electric vehicles (EV) ecosystem and ensuring a solid talent pipeline to help the development of the EV industry in Malaysia, said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)

                The government will instead look to reduce subsidies enjoyed by the wealthy, Anwar, who is also finance minister, told parliament

                Anwar, who took office in November, has ordered a review of Malaysia's subsidy programme, prioritising aid for low-income groups, amid high government debt levels and rising living costs

            <p>
                Government debt and liabilities currently stood at 1.5 trillion ringgit ($114.86 billion), or about 82% of GDP, Anwar said

                Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah delivering his Royal Address in the Dewan Rakyat on Monday (Feb 13)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Institute for Research and Development of Policy (IRDP) research and advocacy officer Farhan Rawi said all input and content of the decree are also a good start for MPs to begin their debate on the Royal Address on Tuesday (Feb 14)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you look at it, there are many inputs or information that His Majesty has decreed and it is a policy speech that should be the reference for MPs to see what are the priorities and direction that the government will undertake this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad said that His Majesty’s decree contained three items of significance, namely the togetherness between the Royal Institution and the government, His Majesty’s desire for the existing government administration, thus becoming a stage for the King to give advice not only to the MPs but also to the government and the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad added that the decree by His Majesty, who hoped that the government would be able to carry out its responsibility of governing the country and the Opposition would carry out its responsibility by offering constructive criticism for the good of the people and the country, was something that needed to be heeded by all parties

                LOVE is in the air! The origin of Valentine’s letters may not be as sweet as chocolate, though
            </p>

                In the poem, he refers to Bonne as his "sweet Valentine"

            <p>
                Going even further back in the history of Valentine’s Day, it is also said that St Valentine – the saint after whom the holiday was named – was intimately familiar with the Roman courts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another legend says that St Valentine fell in love with his jailer’s daughter (or the judge’s daughter, in some versions of the tale)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The legend goes on to say that St Valentine wrote his beloved a note which he signed "from your Valentine"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That being said, there certainly was no love involved in the annals of the Day of Love

                LOVE is in the air! The origin of Valentine’s letters may not be as sweet as chocolate, though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the poem, he refers to Bonne as his "sweet Valentine"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Going even further back in the history of Valentine’s Day, it is also said that St Valentine – the saint after whom the holiday was named – was intimately familiar with the Roman courts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another legend says that St Valentine fell in love with his jailer’s daughter (or the judge’s daughter, in some versions of the tale)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The legend goes on to say that St Valentine wrote his beloved a note which he signed "from your Valentine"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That being said, there certainly was no love involved in the annals of the Day of Love

                In such a case, the public shareholders of the firm would vote on whether or not to extend the dual class structure, and if they declined it, all shares would be converted into a single class of shares with one vote per share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Especially in the early days of a company, a dual-class structure can allow visionary leaders to steer the growth of the business
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So as a prospective investor, how do you know if an exciting dual-share company is just one generation away from flushing it all down the toilet? That’s the rub

                Snickers and M&M’s maker Mars Wrigley has been fined by US safety regulators after two workers at one of its factories fell into a vat of chocolate

                More info Wu Yibing made tennis history this weekend as he became the first Chinese man to win an ATP Tour title at the Dallas Open
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As well as becoming the first Chinese man to win a title, he was also the first in the Open Era to reach a final at tour level and the first to beat a top 10 player, as he dissipated world No 7 Taylor Fritz in the semi-final
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the 23-year-old continues to put his name in the history books for Chinese tennis after jumping a staggering 39 places in the ATP rankings as a result of his win, making him the new world No 58
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It means that Wu is now the highest-ranked Chinese player in ATP history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s more about me personally making history, also for the country

                The Malaysian Bar and Pathmanathan were appealing against the decision of the Court of Appeal, made on Dec 15 last year, which overturned the High Court's decision that upheld the disciplinary board’s decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the court decision on Monday (Feb 13), Justice Nallini said the Court of Appeal should be slow to intervene on the findings of facts made by the disciplinary committee of the advocates and solicitors’ disciplinary board
            </p>
            
            <p>

                On June 13, 2016, Pathmanathan filed a complaint against Sivanesan after the Industrial Court struck off his claim for unfair dismissal due to his absence in court

                A MACC source said the contractors were identified following the anti-graft agency’s investigation into several accounts belonging to Bersatu that were frozen at the end of last month
            </p>

                BNM financial inclusion department director Nor Rafidz Nazri said these debts were acquired during the early working life, during their youth, often for unproductive purposes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We should actively manage our personal financial risks to provide financial safety net during unexpected events, in order to achieve our financial well-being," said Nor Rafidz

            <p>
                As a member of the Financial Education Network that aims to raise the level of financial literacy in Malaysia, Nor Rafidz said BNM conducts FCI Surveys periodically to measure the progress of financial literacy among Malaysians

            <p>
                LIAM president Loh Guat Lan said the association has been actively engaging with the young generation for many years because it is crucial for them to be well-equipped with financial knowledge and should be exposed to personal financial planning as early as possible
            </p>

                Indonesian President Joko Widodo gestures as he talks during an interview at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, Indonesia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The country’s top four construction firms – including the toll road’s main builder, state-owned PT Waskita Karya – have seen their total debt surge more than 12 fold to roughly 130 trillion rupiah (RM37bil) since Jokowi, as the president is known, took office
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite restructuring 29 trillion rupiah (RM8.27bil) of bank loans in 2021, Waskita Karya has appealed to Jakarta for a fresh capital injection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Something has to be done this year or the problem could spread to other sectors like suppliers and vendors.” Waskita Karya’s debt woes could quickly come to a head
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It has 2.3 trillion rupiah (RM656.10mil) of local bonds maturing later this month and another 2.4 trillion rupiah (RM684.63mil) due by May 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are pushing for a fundamental restructuring” of the company, said Kartika Wirjoatmodjo, deputy minister of State-Owned Enterprises, when asked about Waskita Karya

                Kuperan Viswanathan said he expected EPF to provide a 5.5% dividend, which is a decrease from last year’s dividend of 6.1%

                In 2022, EPF declared a dividend rate of 6.1% for conventional savings, with the payout amounting to RM50.5 billion, and 5.65% for syariah savings, with a payout of RM6.3 billion

            <p>
                EPF dividend payouts for conventional savings over the past decade have ranged from a low of 5.2% in 2020 to a high of 6.9% in 2017

                Kuperan Viswanathan said he expected EPF to provide a 5.5% dividend, which is a decrease from last year’s dividend of 6.1%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it is still higher than the dividend of 5.2% in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2022, EPF declared a dividend rate of 6.1% for conventional savings, with the payout amounting to RM50.5 billion, and 5.65% for syariah savings, with a payout of RM6.3 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                EPF dividend payouts for conventional savings over the past decade have ranged from a low of 5.2% in 2020 to a high of 6.9% in 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Despite that, EPF is a low-risk savings platform
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Universiti Malaya economist Datuk Dr Rajah Rasiah said while one would expect a higher dividend to be declared this year as the gross domestic product for Malaysia last year was 8.7% compared with 3.1% in 2021, a lower dividend can be justified because EPF is consolidating the savings

                Singapore lenders are set to report their highest quarterly net interest margins in more than a decade on rising interest rates but as the cycle peaks and economic growth falters, profit growth will be curbed, analysts said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DBS Chief Executive Piyush Gupta said in the bank's results statement that interest rate increases are likely to moderate, but he doesn't expect rate cuts this year

            <p>
                The Singapore-based bank warned that there was a downside risk of 5 to 7 basis points to the group's peak net interest margin guidance of 2.25% due to factors including outflows to treasury bills and a strengthening Singapore dollar

            <p>
                DBS, the first Singapore bank to report this season, said October-December net profit rose to a record 2.34 billion Singapore dollars ($1.76 billion) compared with an average estimate of S$2.16 billion from three analysts, according to Refinitiv data, and S$1.39 billion in the same period a year earlier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DBS reported a total net interest margin, a key gauge of profitability, of 2.05% for the latest quarter, up from 1.43% in the same period a year earlier

                About Us Advertise LEEDS, Feb 13 — Erik ten Hag hailed Marcus Rashford as one of Europe’s best forwards after his late goal inspired Manchester United’s 2-0 win against old rivals Leeds on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Rashford scored to spark United’s comeback from two goals down in Wednesday’s 2-2 draw with Leeds, he tormented the Yorkshire club once again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford netted with 10 minutes left at Elland Road to make it four successive Premier League games with a goal for the England forward, who has scored in eight of his last nine appearances in the competition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When he is keeping the investment and keeps the focus in every game and brings the energy and belief, he will keep scoring.” United’s win was just their second in their last five league games, although they have now lost just once in their last 17 matches in all competitions

            <p>
                Bitter rivals  Amid a cacophonous noise at Elland Road, Leeds made a frenzied start, with Crysencio Summerville firing over after a mistake from United left-back Tyrell Malacia

            <p>
                After scoring United’s equaliser against Leeds in midweek, Jadon Sancho had been rewarded with his first league start since October, but the England forward was largely anonymous and came off after an hour

                China insisted the balloon was conducting weather research

                What has been recovered?  Military teams working from planes, boats and minisubs are scouring the shallow waters off South Carolina for the first object, and military images showed the recovery of a large piece of balloon

                As well as becoming the first Chinese man to win a title, he was also the first in the Open Era to reach a final at tour level and the first to beat a top 10 player, as he dissipated world No 7 Taylor Fritz in the semi-final
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the 23-year-old continues to put his name in the history books for Chinese tennis after jumping a staggering 39 places in the ATP rankings as a result of his win, making him the new world No 58
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It means that Wu is now the highest-ranked Chinese player in ATP history

                Ferdy told Richard that Nofriansyah had insulted him and that he “must die”, Judge Wahyu told the court

                Critics noted that the National Police Commission (Kompolnas), an independent civilian oversight institution which supervises the police, could only advise the police chief but lacked the authority to issue sanctions.

                Eye-catching and sometimes bewildering car plates are a common sight in Hong Kong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sunday’s bid was for a licence plate with the letter "R” and came at a Lunar New Year auction organised by the Hong Kong Transport Department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was just short of a record HK$26 million bid for the letter "W” in 2021, according to rankings published by the Secretary for Transport Lam Sai-hung
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There have been more than 160 auctions and over 40,000 plates have been registered since the personalised car plate system was introduced in 2006, bringing in more than HK$600 million for the government, according to Lam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                People can register to apply for their licence plate of choice, kicking off a process that sometimes lasts as long as 18 months before the plate goes on auction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Applicants must pay HK$5,000 deposit, and if there are no other bidders, then that plate will be theirs for the deposit amount

            <p>
                Eye-catching and sometimes bewildering car plates are a common sight in Hong Kong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sunday’s bid was for a licence plate with the letter "R” and came at a Lunar New Year auction organised by the Hong Kong Transport Department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was just short of a record HK$26 million bid for the letter "W” in 2021, according to rankings published by the Secretary for Transport Lam Sai-hung
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There have been more than 160 auctions and over 40,000 plates have been registered since the personalised car plate system was introduced in 2006, bringing in more than HK$600 million for the government, according to Lam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                People can register to apply for their licence plate of choice, kicking off a process that sometimes lasts as long as 18 months before the plate goes on auction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Applicants must pay HK$5,000 deposit, and if there are no other bidders, then that plate will be theirs for the deposit amount
            </p>

                Here’s a breakdown of the average retirement savings for couples by age
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial expert could help you create a financial plan for your retirement needs and goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This data breaks down individual balances by age group, but for married couples, targets will differ depending on the couple’s age, household income and whether there is a sole earner or dual income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Retirement Savings Benchmarks for Married Couples Financial experts say that a couple aged 60 with a dual income of $75,000 per year should have seven times their household income in their retirement account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regardless of your income level, mapping out your financial situation is a smart way to prepare for retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And, if you want to figure out whether you are saving enough for retirement, SmartAsset’s free retirement calculator can help you determine how much you will need

                “Home prices remain high, but they are better now and dropping.” After mortgage rates surged to nearly 7% last year, home price growth began to slump across the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For instance, the median home listing price in San Francisco was $1.3 million at year-end, according to Realtor.com, still up 3.7% year over year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the average home sold at $1.25 million, or 3.8% off the median listing price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That means that it now takes $600, or 41%, more to make the monthly payment for a 30-year mortgage on the average priced home — after putting 20% down — compared with a year ago

                Many are wondering if this tweet meant that he was taking a break from politics after his loss in GE15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azmin lost the Gombak parliamentary seat after obtaining 59,538 votes, losing to his former protege Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was considered a surprising defeat for Azmin, the International Trade and Industry Minister in the caretaker government, who won the seat in 2018 with 75,113 votes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had held the seat since 2008
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is still the Bukit Antarabangsa assemblyman as Selangor has yet to dissolve its state assembly.
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many are wondering if this tweet meant that he was taking a break from politics after his loss in GE15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azmin lost the Gombak parliamentary seat after obtaining 59,538 votes, losing to his former protege Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was considered a surprising defeat for Azmin, the International Trade and Industry Minister in the caretaker government, who won the seat in 2018 with 75,113 votes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had held the seat since 2008
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is still the Bukit Antarabangsa assemblyman as Selangor has yet to dissolve its state assembly.

                Through a statement issued by Selangor Water Management Authority (Luas), Hee said the spill which took place on the banks of Sungai Selangor was located three kilometres away from the Rantau Panjang WTP main water intake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Luas had taken immediate action by placing three oil booms and three boxes of oil pads in the affected area to prevent the spill from flowing into the river
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The barrage doors were also closed at the WTPs to quicken dilution and prevent the polluted raw water from spreading further away from the main water intake area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Operations to the WTPs resumed at 6.30am on Sunday (Feb 12) after the raw water was re-channelled to the Rantau Panjang plants at 1.30am and the Sungai Selangor Phase 1,2, 3 WTPs at 2.15am following three subsequent scent detection tests which rendered readings of 0 ton each time on Sunday

            <p>
                Wu said that kind of history wasn't on his mind against Fritz, nor was he even thinking ahead to a victory that lined up a title clash with fifth-seeded American John Isner
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Fritz managed to pull out a first set that lasted 58 minutes, Wu had to fight off five break points in the fourth game, and was down 0-30 in the 10th game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He managed to hold serve, break Fritz and hold again to pocket the set, and made a break in the fifth game of the third set stand up for his first career win over a top-10 player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Isner's big serve helped him overcome an otherwise sluggish performance

                Without that I would have been dusted off the court 6-3, 6-4," Isner said.

                0f24b6f7-0f13-4ce0-a0e0-867050131744_93b1e156 A 38-year-old man is taken for a check-up at a psychiatric hospital in China by his mother every Lunar New Year because he is single
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A video of the man – from the central Chinese province of Henan – which was reported on by Sohu News and The Beijing News, has gone viral and provoked a lively debate about the pressure to marry on the mainland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the clip – which has been viewed more than 4 million times – the man, surnamed Wang, says that he has never brought a girlfriend home at Lunar New Year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bizarre “diagnosis” has meant that since 2020, his family has developed a strange tradition, following each Lunar New Year holiday, his mother takes him to see a psychiatrist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On February 4, Wang was once again taken by his mother to the Henan Provincial Psychiatric Hospital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This time, however, the doctor told the mother that her son was not ill but that it was her who had had a problem as she had developed the mental disorder of “forcing her son to marry”

                0f24b6f7-0f13-4ce0-a0e0-867050131744_93b1e156 A 38-year-old man is taken for a check-up at a psychiatric hospital in China by his mother every Lunar New Year because he is single
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A video of the man – from the central Chinese province of Henan – which was reported on by Sohu News and The Beijing News, has gone viral and provoked a lively debate about the pressure to marry on the mainland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the clip – which has been viewed more than 4 million times – the man, surnamed Wang, says that he has never brought a girlfriend home at Lunar New Year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bizarre “diagnosis” has meant that since 2020, his family has developed a strange tradition, following each Lunar New Year holiday, his mother takes him to see a psychiatrist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On February 4, Wang was once again taken by his mother to the Henan Provincial Psychiatric Hospital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This time, however, the doctor told the mother that her son was not ill but that it was her who had had a problem as she had developed the mental disorder of “forcing her son to marry”
            </p>

                Ramasamy, in a posting on Facebook, urged the government to carry out reforms in the public service sector, as he claimed that it is being dominated by the Malays
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also urged Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to immediately address the issue and ensure that the public service reflects the ethnic composition of the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Previously, many people were not interested in joining the public service due to the low salary factor compared to jobs in other fields
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, most of those who join the public service, especially in the security and defence sectors, do so out of patriotism and love for the country,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cuepacs, he said, always welcomed the views and opinions of all quarters to improve the public service to attract other races to join the sector

                People fill up sandbags at a public collection point in preparation for the arrival of Cyclone Gabrielle in Auckland, New Zealand, Feb 12, 2023

            <p>
                Gabrielle, downgraded to a sub-tropical low pressure system from a Category 2 cyclone, hit Norfolk Island on Saturday night, with its most destructive winds missing the island, before tracking to New Zealand, 1,460km (910 miles) south

            <p>
                Wind and rain were spreading from the country's north, with a 140kmh (87 miles per hour) wind gust reported on the country's North Island on Sunday afternoon, MetService said.

            <p>
                The storm was on track to lie off Cape Reinga at the North Island's north end on Sunday afternoon, after moving away from Norfolk Island, MetService said

            <p>
                On Norfolk Island, which covers just over 34 sq km (13 square miles) in the Pacific Ocean between New Caledonia and New Zealand, authorities said they were clearing debris and trees from roads and restoring power knocked out in the storm

                After challenging for the quadruple last season and hitting the maximum possible fixture count, Klopp's side have struggled this year and sit 10th in the league after 20 games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool are expected to 'back Jurgen Klopp to revamp his squad this summer' It comes after a shocking start to the season that has seen Liverpool slump to 10th after 20 league games The Times also claim Liverpool will be buoyed by the introduction of a new head of eesearch, as the club has already picked a candidate who is 'working in the game and regarded as a leading operator in the football data field.' They will replace Dr Ian Graham in the role, who may prove a tough act to follow as he is credited with masterminding a number of Liverpool's key signings in the last decade, including that of Klopp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They have lost each of their last three away games, conceding three goals in each match, and are already 22 points off league leaders Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new signings brought in this season, most notably Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo, have struggled to hit the heights expected of them so far, as Liverpool have scored just one league goal since the start of the year

                After challenging for the quadruple last season and hitting the maximum possible fixture count, Klopp's side have struggled this year and sit 10th in the league after 20 games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool are expected to 'back Jurgen Klopp to revamp his squad this summer' It comes after a shocking start to the season that has seen Liverpool slump to 10th after 20 league games The Times also claim Liverpool will be buoyed by the introduction of a new head of eesearch, as the club has already picked a candidate who is 'working in the game and regarded as a leading operator in the football data field.' They will replace Dr Ian Graham in the role, who may prove a tough act to follow as he is credited with masterminding a number of Liverpool's key signings in the last decade, including that of Klopp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They have lost each of their last three away games, conceding three goals in each match, and are already 22 points off league leaders Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new signings brought in this season, most notably Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo, have struggled to hit the heights expected of them so far, as Liverpool have scored just one league goal since the start of the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will next be in action in a tricky Merseyside derby against an Everton side that look rejuvenated under Sean Dyche and beat league leaders Arsenal in their last match

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, Feb 12 — The odour pollution incident which forced four water treatment plants (LRAs) in the state to be shut down temporarily last night was caused by a fuel spill, believed to be diesel from heavy machinery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                State Tourism, Environment, Green Technology and Orang Asli Affairs Committee chairman Hee Loy Sian said the Selangor Water Management Authority’s (LUAS) investigation along Sungai Selangor found the oil spill at the river bank some three kilometres away from the Rantau Panjang LRA intake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hee said the temporary shutdown of the LRAs intake points for around four hours was a control and preventive measure to avoid worse pollution to the water treatment system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The problem was quickly addressed with the channelling of raw water starting at 10 pm yesterday and lowering the barrage gates at the LRA intake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Hee said that raw water was channelled back to the Rantau Panjang LRA intake at 1.30am and at 2.15am today to the Sungai Selangor Phase 1 (SSP1) LRA, Sungai Selangor Phase 2 (SSP2) LRA and Selangor Phase 3 (SSP3) LRA after recording three consecutive zero TON readings

                Liverpool let go of one Japanese international last summer in Takumi Minamino, and they might just be ready to sign another one this coming summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool is attempting to sign former Birmingham City midfielder Jude Bellingham this summer, but they are also keeping an eye on the 'next' Jude Bellingham, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's according to Football Insider, who states that Liverpool has sent scouts to keep an eye on George Hall

            <p>
                Football Insider also believes that Liverpool will want to secure a deal before the summer transfer window opens, in order to sign Hall before his valuation begins to climb

                Liverpool let go of one Japanese international last summer in Takumi Minamino, and they might just be ready to sign another one this coming summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool is attempting to sign former Birmingham City midfielder Jude Bellingham this summer, but they are also keeping an eye on the 'next' Jude Bellingham, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's according to Football Insider, who states that Liverpool has sent scouts to keep an eye on George Hall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Football Insider also believes that Liverpool will want to secure a deal before the summer transfer window opens, in order to sign Hall before his valuation begins to climb

                Chelsea boss Graham Potter has said some of the club's new signings need to adapt to the Premier League, with the club's January spending spree yet to turn around their poor form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw against West Ham United on Saturday, with Atletico Madrid loanee Joao Felix scoring his first goal for the club before former Chelsea fullback Emerson levelled the game shortly after
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The result means Chelsea have won just once in their last eight matches in all competitions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "You can also see the potential of the team but you can also see where the work is, which is getting Reece James up to speed, which is getting Ben Chilwell up to speed, which is getting Ruben Loftus-Cheek up to speed, which is getting Wesley Fofana up to speed, which is getting N'Golo Kante up to speed, which is adapting [Myhailo] Mudryk into the Premier League, which is adapting [Noni] Madueke into the Premier League, which adapting Benoit Badiashile into the Premier League, which is adapting Joao Felix into the Premier League

                "That's just how it is, that's the way I see it and I'll just be honest to say how it is but I completely understand that people are frustrated if you don't win." Chelsea made eight signings in January and, due to their inflated squad, had to leave defender Badiashile and striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang out of their Champions League roster
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Then you have to have honest conversations and respect the fact that players will be disappointed, because that's normal." Chelsea are ninth in the Premier League table after Saturday's draw and restart their Champions League campaign at Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.

                Clubs like Man United, Arsenal, Liverpool were informed around the general situation of Ansu Fati.” Back in 2021, the 20-year-old attacker was handed a bumper new contract with a 1000 million euros release clause and the iconic No

            <p>
                Fati is mainly a left winger and at Anfield, we already have a top-class LW in the form of Luis Diaz and Klopp further reinforced the position by luring Cody Gakpo last month

            <p>
                Therefore, Liverpool really do not need to lure Fati and must focus on strengthening the midfield first

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fati is mainly a left winger and at Anfield, we already have a top-class LW in the form of Luis Diaz and Klopp further reinforced the position by luring Cody Gakpo last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, Liverpool really do not need to lure Fati and must focus on strengthening the midfield first

                SMART MAS-01 search and rescue operations officer (SAR) Insp Muhamad Zul Khairi Idris said the cry of ‘takbir’ (Allahuakbar) when the first victim - a teenage boy - was taken out at 1.20pm (6.20pm Malaysian time) almost brought the team into tears

                One by one, the remaining victims were successfully taken out by 2.20pm (7.20pm Malaysian time) in safe condition before being handed over to the local medical team

            <p>
                "At 1pm (6pm Malaysian time) the local team at the ground said there was a sound coming from under the rubble, we then used the Life Detector Six Sensor System and Victim Simulator (Delsar) equipment to successfully locate the victims who were trapped two metres under the rubble

                The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) Peninsular Malaysia was on Saturday reported to have called on the ministry  to postpone  the use of the IDME which was not stable, apart from claiming that it was not viable yet to fill in the scores of the Final Academic Session (UASA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The IDME, developed by the ministry, is accessed by a single login through its website, and all educators who fill out the UASA and classroom assessment must go through the IDME system, that is, they need to log in to the system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time,  Fadhlina reiterated that the start of the new school calendar will return to January but not in the near future as the justifications must be resolved according to the Education Act 1996 and economic issues and teacher workload would have to be taken into consideration

                The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) Peninsular Malaysia was on Saturday reported to have called on the ministry  to postpone  the use of the IDME which was not stable, apart from claiming that it was not viable yet to fill in the scores of the Final Academic Session (UASA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The IDME, developed by the ministry, is accessed by a single login through its website, and all educators who fill out the UASA and classroom assessment must go through the IDME system, that is, they need to log in to the system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time,  Fadhlina reiterated that the start of the new school calendar will return to January but not in the near future as the justifications must be resolved according to the Education Act 1996 and economic issues and teacher workload would have to be taken into consideration

                Fabio Quartararo has confirmed that Yamaha have supplied him with two new engine specifications at the Sepang MotoGP Test, which is the same number as last year’s Misano test
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2021 MotoGP champion, who was one of the quickest in terms of top speed on day one, found yet more speed on day two whilst also moving up the leaderboard when it came to overall lap times.  Following an 11th place finish on Friday, Quartararo ended day two less than two tenths away from Jorge Martin after finishing fourth fastest.  "Today was a positive day even if we just had a few laps [in the dry]," said Quartararo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We tried an aero package which was actually difficult to know which one was better and if it was better than our standard [one] because we tried with one tyre but then with the same tyre it was more windy.   "We have to try it in a better way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In general, my last run with more than 20 laps on the tyre I was riding pretty fast.  "I’m happy about the day and hopefully tomorrow the weather is better and we can try some new tyres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have two engines like in Misano.  "In 2022 we had no engine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even when we started the test we knew that the engine was going to be the same as previous years.  "Already today and before starting the test we had a meeting with Yamaha and things are looking much better than in 2022

                Even when we started the test we knew that the engine was going to be the same as previous years.  "Already today and before starting the test we had a meeting with Yamaha and things are looking much better than in 2022

                About Us Advertise SEREMBAN, Feb 11 — The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security will overcome the problem of shortage of workers which is one of the factors causing the lack of supply of chicken eggs ahead of Ramadan and Aidilfitri, said its minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said to overcome the problem, his ministry together with the Ministry of Home Affairs (KDN) and the Ministry of Human Resources are working to increase the number of workers in the agricultural sector and other sectors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “My ministry is dealing with it (the problem of chicken egg supply), indeed every time before a festival, the consumption of chicken eggs is higher, this problem of egg shortage is also faced by other countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The concern remains, as soon as Ramadan comes, the use of eggs and other ingredients will increase, that’s why we have to discuss with the egg suppliers to double the production from now, that’s what we hope
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Mohamad said the Malaysian government will continue to support and speak out in fighting for the rights of the Palestinian people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said programmes about awareness of fighting for the Palestinian people need to continue and that now more non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from European countries are providing support to the Palestinian people

                About Us Advertise SEREMBAN, Feb 11 — The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security will overcome the problem of shortage of workers which is one of the factors causing the lack of supply of chicken eggs ahead of Ramadan and Aidilfitri, said its minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said to overcome the problem, his ministry together with the Ministry of Home Affairs (KDN) and the Ministry of Human Resources are working to increase the number of workers in the agricultural sector and other sectors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “My ministry is dealing with it (the problem of chicken egg supply), indeed every time before a festival, the consumption of chicken eggs is higher, this problem of egg shortage is also faced by other countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The concern remains, as soon as Ramadan comes, the use of eggs and other ingredients will increase, that’s why we have to discuss with the egg suppliers to double the production from now, that’s what we hope
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Mohamad said the Malaysian government will continue to support and speak out in fighting for the rights of the Palestinian people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said programmes about awareness of fighting for the Palestinian people need to continue and that now more non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from European countries are providing support to the Palestinian people

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 11 — The appointment of Umno warlord Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz as the new Malaysian ambassador to the United States was made a year ago, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has clarified today
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Nazri's appointment was met with disapproval, among others from former ex-diplomats including former ambassador to the Netherlands Datuk Noor Farida Ariffin and former Malaysian high commissioner to Canada Dennis Ignatius

                Declan Rice is a prized asset for West Ham and England, but Graeme Souness believes he lacks two of the key attributes Manchester United midfielder Casemiro displays Graeme Souness claims Declan Rice does not possess two of the three key qualities a complete, top-level central midfielder needs to have in their locker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rice, 24, is regarded as one of the best in the Premier League in his position and is a shoo-in for England
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For me, Rice has just one of them." Do you agree with Graeme Souness? Have your say in the comments! Souness suspects Rice is "not the best" as a result of his attacking shortcomings and compared the former Chelsea academy starlet's statistics to his own to illustrate his point
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having assessed Rice's pros and cons, Souness drew attention to Manchester United enforcer Casemiro, labelling him the "best central midfielder around"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Casemiro has transformed Manchester United's midfield and his absence was sorely felt in their 2-2 draw with Leeds on Wednesday night

                Declan Rice is a prized asset for West Ham and England, but Graeme Souness believes he lacks two of the key attributes Manchester United midfielder Casemiro displays Graeme Souness claims Declan Rice does not possess two of the three key qualities a complete, top-level central midfielder needs to have in their locker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rice, 24, is regarded as one of the best in the Premier League in his position and is a shoo-in for England
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For me, Rice has just one of them." Do you agree with Graeme Souness? Have your say in the comments! Souness suspects Rice is "not the best" as a result of his attacking shortcomings and compared the former Chelsea academy starlet's statistics to his own to illustrate his point
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having assessed Rice's pros and cons, Souness drew attention to Manchester United enforcer Casemiro, labelling him the "best central midfielder around"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Casemiro has transformed Manchester United's midfield and his absence was sorely felt in their 2-2 draw with Leeds on Wednesday night

                Instead of being the junior development director, Misbun will now only focus on the junior singles department while in a surprise move, doubles coaching director Rexy Mainaky has been given more responsibilities

                The Indonesian will now also oversee the junior doubles players in the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM)

            <p>
                ABM executive chief director Michelle Chai said the restructuring of the junior coaching line-up was needed to avoid the team from going down the same path

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The junior doubles will be monitored by Rexy, where he will oversee it from top to bottom so that it’ll be a seamless transition from junior to senior,” said Michelle, adding that the restructure would be effective this week

                About Us Advertise JOHOR BARU, Feb 11 — After a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19, the Chingay Parade Festival returned with a grand celebration which saw a crowd of over 300,000 thronging along Jalan Wong Ah Fook and around the city here, tonight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The procession of over 80 decorated vehicles which covered a distance of about 7.8 kilometres, began at the Xing Gong Temple in Jalan Ulu Air Molek, passed through Jalan Yahya Awal, Jalan Ibrahim, Jalan Wong Ah Fook, Jalan Gereja, Jalan Ngee Heng, Jalan Tun Abdul Razak, finally ended back at Xing Gong Temple, here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A visitor from Kuala Lumpur, Yang Chun Hou, 29 said he was thrilled to watch the parade as this was his first time at the festival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Hezrina Hedzer, 53, said the last time she attended the parade festival was in 2020 but it was a small celebration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, the Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar arrived to officiate 2023 Chingay Parade festival by beating the drums on the main stage

            <p>
                The last time the festival was held was in 2020 and it was organised on a small scale with only five decorated vehicles in the procession, to curb the spread of Covid-19

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Liverpool expects to be at the summit and as a result, many would be inclined to think Klopp's eventual replacement should be accustomed to such prestige, originating from the likes of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or one of the other select few elite institutions on the continent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those beliefs could be justified and Liverpool could indeed replace Klopp with a seasoned and experienced figure who is known for delivering on the highest level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Postecoglou has proved to be a likable and charismatic character in Glasgow, with his current situation at Celtic being vaguely comparable to Klopp at Liverpool, as the pair are beloved by their respective fanbases for similar reasons

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Liverpool expects to be at the summit and as a result, many would be inclined to think Klopp's eventual replacement should be accustomed to such prestige, originating from the likes of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or one of the other select few elite institutions on the continent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those beliefs could be justified and Liverpool could indeed replace Klopp with a seasoned and experienced figure who is known for delivering on the highest level

            <p>
                Postecoglou has proved to be a likable and charismatic character in Glasgow, with his current situation at Celtic being vaguely comparable to Klopp at Liverpool, as the pair are beloved by their respective fanbases for similar reasons

                Malaysia’s economy recorded an encouraging performance with the GDP for 2022 recording 8.7 per cent, exceeding the estimate of 6.5 per cent - 7.0 per cent made in October 2022

                Anwar said that he was aware that there were a few 'wealthy people' protesting the decision with various threats, but the firm decision taken by the government showed a positive sign in the aspect of hiring foreign workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister said that without illegal money payments and oppressive corrupt practices, the government's comprehensive measures saw almost 200,000 foreign workers enter and register as workers in the country

            <p>
                He added that, for example, the cost for a worker from Nepal is only RM3,700, but for those from Bangladesh and Indonesia, each worker involves a cost between RM20,000 and RM25,000, due to the high fees charged by agents, and described it as ‘modern slavery’

                Malaysia’s economy recorded an encouraging performance with the GDP for 2022 recording 8.7 per cent, exceeding the estimate of 6.5 per cent - 7.0 per cent made in October 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This growth performance also far exceeds the 3.1 per cent economic growth achieved in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Anwar, the achievement of 8.7 per cent growth for 2022 is supported by a strong economic performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 which, among other things, saw the recovery of private spending and investment, a decrease in unemployment and the strengthening of the ringgit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The labour market maintains high employment levels with the unemployment rate decreasing to 3.6 per cent in 4Q 2022 compared to 3.7 per cent in 3Q 2022,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Total trade grew by 14.8 per cent to RM718.7 billion with gross exports and imports increasing by 11.8 per cent and 18.7 per cent respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The country's GDP growth is however expected to moderate in 2023, in line with the latest global economic outlook by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank which estimates world economic growth to decrease from 3.4 per cent in 2022 to 2.9 per cent in 2023

            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 10 — Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli today agreed that the country needs to create high and equal salaries while lowering costs of living by implementing programmes such as Menu Rahmah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the country is seeking to become a high-income nation in the next few years by crossing the gross national income (GNI) threshold of USD 15,205 (RM57,050) while seeking to have a more equal income distribution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since achieving the middle-income nation status in 1985, Malaysia’s economic growth has lagged behind other nations and fallen into the “middle-income trap”, a notion used to describe countries that are unable to catch up with higher-income nations

            <p>
                “What we want to make sure is we don’t hit the status by per capita instead ensure the inequality gap is taken care of,” he said, adding that the government is looking into policy to calibrate equal wage growth among different income groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said other government initiatives such as moving to a digital economy, upskilling, and reskilling are all aimed at creating high-income jobs

                When asked what measures the government had in mind as alternatives, Rafizi said he is unable to answer at the moment, but noted that the administration’s plans to implement targeted subsidies will aid in alleviating the cost of living burden on the vulnerable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The process to make that decision is under way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi claimed the implementation of targeted subsidies is a “big challenge”, and that is why prior administrations did not attempt to implement it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think the government will go through this process and balance the implementation, which will be released in stages,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the government plans to subsidise the cost of goods for the vulnerable, he highlighted that it must also ensure that wage growth among the various economic strata is balanced.  He shared that the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) had zoned in on wage growth as one of the focuses of the 12th Malaysia Plan’s (12MP) mid-term review
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But what we want to make sure of as well is that we don’t hit the high-income nation status by per capita while inequality is still big,” he stressed.  Last December, Rafizi said the EPU is expected to table the 12MP's mid-term review in September this year

                When asked what measures the government had in mind as alternatives, Rafizi said he is unable to answer at the moment, but noted that the administration’s plans to implement targeted subsidies will aid in alleviating the cost of living burden on the vulnerable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The process to make that decision is under way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi claimed the implementation of targeted subsidies is a “big challenge”, and that is why prior administrations did not attempt to implement it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think the government will go through this process and balance the implementation, which will be released in stages,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the government plans to subsidise the cost of goods for the vulnerable, he highlighted that it must also ensure that wage growth among the various economic strata is balanced.  He shared that the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) had zoned in on wage growth as one of the focuses of the 12th Malaysia Plan’s (12MP) mid-term review
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But what we want to make sure of as well is that we don’t hit the high-income nation status by per capita while inequality is still big,” he stressed.  Last December, Rafizi said the EPU is expected to table the 12MP's mid-term review in September this year

                It is learnt that the syndicate would demand bribes in the form of commission in allocating the number of seats to these companies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to sources, one of the firms was appointed by an international airline company as the sole agent to manage and distribute quotas for flight seats for each umrah flight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is learnt that the syndicate’s modus operandi was to impose a “payment” of between RM50 and RM250 for each ticket quota for umrah

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 10 — Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) today announced that Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.7 per cent last year, and gave assurance that Malaysia’s economy will not be going into a recession this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a press conference, BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus pointed out that last year’s growth rate is the highest annual growth rate posted by the country in the past 22 years — after the 8.9 per cent growth rate recorded in 2000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was also announced that the GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2022 (Q4 2022) moderated to 7.0 per cent — following the 14.2 per cent growth registered in Q3 2022 — due to waning support from stimulus measures and low base effects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, net exports contracted by 1.8 per cent, albeit showing improvement compared to the 4.1 per contraction in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Headline inflation for the year stood at 3.3 per cent while core inflation was at three per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uzir added that 2022’s GDP amounted to RM1.8 trillion at current prices, and RM1.5 trillion at constant prices — leaving the gross national income per capita to surge to RM52,819 from the RM46,163 recorded the previous year.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 10 — Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) today announced that Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.7 per cent last year, and gave assurance that Malaysia’s economy will not be going into a recession this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a press conference, BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus pointed out that last year’s growth rate is the highest annual growth rate posted by the country in the past 22 years — after the 8.9 per cent growth rate recorded in 2000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was also announced that the GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2022 (Q4 2022) moderated to 7.0 per cent — following the 14.2 per cent growth registered in Q3 2022 — due to waning support from stimulus measures and low base effects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, net exports contracted by 1.8 per cent, albeit showing improvement compared to the 4.1 per contraction in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Headline inflation for the year stood at 3.3 per cent while core inflation was at three per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uzir added that 2022’s GDP amounted to RM1.8 trillion at current prices, and RM1.5 trillion at constant prices — leaving the gross national income per capita to surge to RM52,819 from the RM46,163 recorded the previous year.
            </p>

                Kirby said the US would discuss the “Chinese spy balloon programme” on Wednesday with some allies and partners around the world, as the Biden administration believed it was important for those countries to be apprised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The appearance of the suspected spy balloon led to the postponement of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s planned visit to China on February 5-6
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Blinken also said that the US was not the only target of a “broader” Chinese surveillance programme and that Washington has shared information it has obtained about China’s balloon with dozens of countries around the world, during a joint press conference with Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stoltenberg said the flight of the balloon confirmed a pattern of Chinese behaviour in building up new military capabilities and that China had also increased intelligence activities in Europe

                Blinken also said that the US was not the only target of a “broader” Chinese surveillance programme and that Washington has shared information it has obtained about China’s balloon with dozens of countries around the world, during a joint press conference with Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday
            </p>

                Stoltenberg said the flight of the balloon confirmed a pattern of Chinese behaviour in building up new military capabilities and that China had also increased intelligence activities in Europe

                Mark Ogden explains the latest updates around the potential sale of Manchester United by the Glazer family
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Raine Group, the New York-based investment bank, are overseeing the process to either sell the club or attract substantial new investment and a soft deadline of Feb
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Separate sources familiar with the bidding process have told ESPN that at least two groups with an interest in an involvement in United are sceptical that the Glazers are looking to sell all of their stake in the club, which they bought in 2005 following a leveraged takeover
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Multiple sources told ESPN that Joel and Avram Glazer, the United co-chairmen, have not ruled out the prospect of attracting a wealthy investor to help fund the club's plans to upgrade Old Trafford and United's Carrington training ground
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But with four of the Glazer siblings having already reduced their shareholding in recent months, sources have said that Joel and Avram accept that they cannot hold onto United unless they find outside investment through the sale process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have said that the £6bn valuation is unrealistically high due to United's debt and need for additional funds to upgrade Old Trafford

                Separate sources familiar with the bidding process have told ESPN that at least two groups with an interest in an involvement in United are sceptical that the Glazers are looking to sell all of their stake in the club, which they bought in 2005 following a leveraged takeover
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Multiple sources told ESPN that Joel and Avram Glazer, the United co-chairmen, have not ruled out the prospect of attracting a wealthy investor to help fund the club's plans to upgrade Old Trafford and United's Carrington training ground
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But with four of the Glazer siblings having already reduced their shareholding in recent months, sources have said that Joel and Avram accept that they cannot hold onto United unless they find outside investment through the sale process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have said that the £6bn valuation is unrealistically high due to United's debt and need for additional funds to upgrade Old Trafford

                The 7.8-magnitude quake struck early Monday as people slept, in a region where many had already suffered loss and displacement due to Syria’s civil war

                Anwar was asked whether the government would consider another round of EPF withdrawals in the upcoming revised Budget 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last month, a group of EPF contributors called on the government to consider another early withdrawal of up to RM30,000

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said he fully understood the issue regarding the EPF withdrawals which was raised by various parties, adding, however, that the withdrawals had depleted the savings of EPF members

                The short-covering rally appears to have been set in motion by Tesla's recent price cuts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In early January, Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 base version by $3,000 to $43,990

            <p>
                The Model 3 Performance variant saw a price cut of $9,000 to $53,990
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tesla also dropped the price for the Model Y Long Range by $13,000 to $52,990 while the Performance model was cut to $56,990, about $13,000 cheaper than the prior price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Longtime Tesla bull and Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood told Yahoo Finance she believes the price cuts stem from Tesla's cost leadership position in battery technology
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I think traditional auto manufacturers are going to have trouble keeping up with the price declines that Tesla's technology is enabling," Wood said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above)

                The new players were announced in separate posts on Thursday evening on Blacklist’s Facebook page

            <p>
                Spearheading the new roster are old-timers Johnmar “OhMyV33NUS” Villaluna, Danerie “Wise” Del Rosario, and Season 10 finals MVP Edward “EDWARD” Dapadap

                Rumors of Renejay joining the code breakers started last season after he was spotted at the MPL PH Season 10 grand final venue seated next to Blacklist CEO Tryke Gutierrez in the front row

                Former Nexplay EVOS superstar Renejay “Renejay” Barcase, and rookies Jon Redick “Super Red” Bordeos, Kenneth Carl “Yue” Tadeo, and Archer “Archer” Perez will play for the defending champions this season, the organization announced on Facebook
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new players were announced in separate posts on Thursday evening on Blacklist’s Facebook page
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spearheading the new roster are old-timers Johnmar “OhMyV33NUS” Villaluna, Danerie “Wise” Del Rosario, and Season 10 finals MVP Edward “EDWARD” Dapadap
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rumors of Renejay joining the code breakers started last season after he was spotted at the MPL PH Season 10 grand final venue seated next to Blacklist CEO Tryke Gutierrez in the front row
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former MHRLK standout Kenneth Carl “Yue” Tadeo is also no stranger to Blacklist, as he was part of the SIBOL’s IESF’s 14th WE Championship roster alongside the entire Blacklist squad

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 10 ― Datuk Misbun Sidek’s role has changed from Badminton Association of Malaysia’s (BAM) director of youth development to the director of youth singles coaching effective this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) executive director Michelle Chai said the change in position was part of a programme to reorganise the national youth squad's coaching line-up following the disappointing performance at the 2022 BWF World Junior Championships in Santander, Spain, last October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Michelle said ABM would also utilise the expertise of BAM doubles coaching director Rexy Mainaky who had been made the new youth doubles coaching director
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the first time ever, no national player qualified for the quarter-finals of the singles event at the world junior championships, and the national team only finished ninth in the mixed team event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was the second time in a row that Malaysia returned empty-handed after the 2019 edition in Kazan, Russia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our last mixed team event win was at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, so that has given us a motivational boost for the BAMTC,” he told reporters after the last day of the central training camp ahead of BAMTC here today
