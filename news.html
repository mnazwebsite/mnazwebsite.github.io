                Malaysia should also adopt neutrality in trade policies to attract investment for long-term economic stability, said Dr Jomo Kwame Sundram
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a recent interview with The Edge, Jomo said wasteful and unnecessary spending needs to be cut in line with the steady slowdown in direct tax collection over the decades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The subject of targeted subsidy has been in the spotlight, particularly targeted petrol subsidy, as the current blanket subsidy mechanism caused total subsidy bills to jump to RM80 billion last year amid elevated oil prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This put a strain on the government’s coffers, which has seen a gradual increase in big-ticket operating expenditures, such as subsidies, debt service charges and emoluments as a percentage of federal government revenue year after year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jomo expects more responsible budgets and major reforms by the government over the medium term rather than sooner — perhaps in Budget 2024 to be tabled in October this year, once the regime is further consolidated following imminent state elections in mid-2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new government is also looking to restore economic confidence with a five-member advisory committee chaired by Tan Sri Mohd Hassan Marican to look at ways to reduce federal operating expenditure and increase the nation’s revenue base, among others

                Malaysia should also adopt neutrality in trade policies to attract investment for long-term economic stability, said Dr Jomo Kwame Sundram
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a recent interview with The Edge, Jomo said wasteful and unnecessary spending needs to be cut in line with the steady slowdown in direct tax collection over the decades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The subject of targeted subsidy has been in the spotlight, particularly targeted petrol subsidy, as the current blanket subsidy mechanism caused total subsidy bills to jump to RM80 billion last year amid elevated oil prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This put a strain on the government’s coffers, which has seen a gradual increase in big-ticket operating expenditures, such as subsidies, debt service charges and emoluments as a percentage of federal government revenue year after year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jomo expects more responsible budgets and major reforms by the government over the medium term rather than sooner — perhaps in Budget 2024 to be tabled in October this year, once the regime is further consolidated following imminent state elections in mid-2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new government is also looking to restore economic confidence with a five-member advisory committee chaired by Tan Sri Mohd Hassan Marican to look at ways to reduce federal operating expenditure and increase the nation’s revenue base, among others

                The Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corp (MGTC) has honoured Penang for its design as part of its drive to promote Low Carbon Cities (LCCs) in Malaysia, with the state given the “Diamond” award for PSI’s design at the Low Carbon City 2022 event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                MGTC, an agency under the Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change Ministry, said the Low Carbon City 2022 award was part of its flagship programme called the Low Carbon Cities 2030 Challenge (LCC2030C), an initiative to help shift Malaysian cities and conversations towards a low carbon future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The push for low carbon cities began in 2011, when the Low Carbon Cities Framework and Assessment System (LCCF) was set up by the government (under the then Energy, Green Technology and Water Ministry) to guide local authorities and statutory organisations to transform their towns and territories into low carbon urban centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PSI scored big in both energy consumption and low-emission mobility, with each contributing savings of 15.61% and 20.26%, respectively

            </p>
            
            <p>
                MGTC, an agency under the Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change Ministry, said the Low Carbon City 2022 award was part of its flagship programme called the Low Carbon Cities 2030 Challenge (LCC2030C), an initiative to help shift Malaysian cities and conversations towards a low carbon future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The push for low carbon cities began in 2011, when the Low Carbon Cities Framework and Assessment System (LCCF) was set up by the government (under the then Energy, Green Technology and Water Ministry) to guide local authorities and statutory organisations to transform their towns and territories into low carbon urban centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PSI scored big in both energy consumption and low-emission mobility, with each contributing savings of 15.61% and 20.26%, respectively

                What happened last May doesn’t matter on Tuesday night.  Liverpool and Real Madrid are now new teams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real will try to play to Vinicius as much as they can in the gap that Alexander-Arnold will leave when he goes forward.  How can you stop Real doing that? It will be a big challenge for Jurgen Klopp because Alexander-Arnold offers so much when he pushes high, but Vinicius is the one player who can make a difference and hurt Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will offer balance to the midfield and that will be difficult for Liverpool to deal with
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We were so good and went on to win 4-0.  I watched Liverpool against Everton last week and the intensity of the team and the fans made the difference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real’s advantage in the past was having more experience in important European games but Liverpool have a lot of players like that now.  If they play with the same intensity as they did in their last home game, Liverpool will have chances
            </p>

                The Human Resources Minister said the reduction in the cost of recruitment would be discussed at the two-day Joint Working Group Meeting in Yogjakarta beginning Wednesday (Feb 22)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sivakumar said he hoped the cost could be brought down to under RM9,000 compared to the RM12,000 decided in the last meeting in November 2022, inclusive of the quarantine cost of RM3,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "To have zero cost is impossible because there are costs involved including in Malaysia, but we look at what is the best mechanism to reduce the cost,” he told the Malaysian media after holding a meeting with his Indonesian counterpart, Dr Ida Fauziyah on Monday (Feb 20)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He and Ida Fauziyah also discussed efforts to realise the implementation of the "Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the Recruitment and Protection of Indonesian Domestic Workers in Malaysia" that was signed on April 1, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the total, 63,323 work as domestic workers, and Indonesians represent the largest number in the sector in Malaysia

                The Human Resources Minister said the reduction in the cost of recruitment would be discussed at the two-day Joint Working Group Meeting in Yogjakarta beginning Wednesday (Feb 22)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sivakumar said he hoped the cost could be brought down to under RM9,000 compared to the RM12,000 decided in the last meeting in November 2022, inclusive of the quarantine cost of RM3,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "To have zero cost is impossible because there are costs involved including in Malaysia, but we look at what is the best mechanism to reduce the cost,” he told the Malaysian media after holding a meeting with his Indonesian counterpart, Dr Ida Fauziyah on Monday (Feb 20)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He and Ida Fauziyah also discussed efforts to realise the implementation of the "Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the Recruitment and Protection of Indonesian Domestic Workers in Malaysia" that was signed on April 1, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the total, 63,323 work as domestic workers, and Indonesians represent the largest number in the sector in Malaysia
            </p>

                The club is poised to make a bid for Eintracht Frankfurt forward Randal Kolo-Muani this summer, according to a report from Germany last week

            <p>
                This would represent a historic profit for the Bundesliga outfit, which signed Kolo Muani on a free transfer last summer after he reached the end of his contract with French club Nantes

            <p>
                Erik ten Hag has continued to put his faith in Wout Weghorst despite a slow scoring start to life at Man Utd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst has arrived at United at a difficult time given he will naturally draw comparisons with Anthony Martial and Cristiano Ronaldo, and while he has not matched the duo for goals this season, he has at least given Ten Hag the reliable work rate he demands up front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think he is doing a very good job in this moment in several aspects of the football." This was the case again against Leicester at the weekend, with Weghorst playing a key role in United's approach, even though he didn't enjoy the best day in front of goal himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is also important to note that it is not Weghorst's fault that he has been exposed by the lack of options in the United squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag is the man paid to make the decisions at United, and the fact he continues to trust his compatriot up front speaks volumes of the value he brings to the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst might not be the striker United fans wanted, but right now he is the striker they need

                Erik ten Hag has continued to put his faith in Wout Weghorst despite a slow scoring start to life at Man Utd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst has arrived at United at a difficult time given he will naturally draw comparisons with Anthony Martial and Cristiano Ronaldo, and while he has not matched the duo for goals this season, he has at least given Ten Hag the reliable work rate he demands up front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think he is doing a very good job in this moment in several aspects of the football." This was the case again against Leicester at the weekend, with Weghorst playing a key role in United's approach, even though he didn't enjoy the best day in front of goal himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is also important to note that it is not Weghorst's fault that he has been exposed by the lack of options in the United squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag is the man paid to make the decisions at United, and the fact he continues to trust his compatriot up front speaks volumes of the value he brings to the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst might not be the striker United fans wanted, but right now he is the striker they need

                A case management for the appeal was conducted on Monday before Court of Appeal deputy registrar Norshakinah Ahmad Kamarudin

            <p>
                On Oct 27, last year, the High Court in Kuala Lumpur dismissed the former prime minister's application to obtain leave to commence a judicial review to challenge the Prisons Department's refusal to allow his request to attend Parliament sittings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Datuk Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid held that Najib's application was academic as he ceased to be a MP following the dissolution of Parliament on Oct 10 last year, which had paved the way for the 15th General Election which was subsequently held on Nov 19 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib had named the Malaysian Government, the Minister of Home Affairs and the Commissioner-General of Prisons in his application seeking leave to initiate a judicial review which he filed on Oct 5, last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hearing of his application to review the Federal Court's decision is currently ongoing

                Siti Bainun, 31, told the court that she had appointed Mohammad Farhan Maaruf to represent her in the defence trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohammad Farhan, when confirming the matter, said he was re-appointed by Siti Bainun yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Subsequently, deputy public prosecutor Zilfinaz Abbas requested the court to record the chronology of the withdrawal of the lawyers representing Siti Bainun in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the withdrawal of the five lawyers, Siti Bainun was left with no legal representation in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Jan 26, Judge Izralizam ordered Siti Bainun to enter her defence on the charges even though she had no legal representation, saying that the proceedings should continue so as not to disrupt the progress of the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Nov 24 last year, the court ordered Siti Bainun to enter her defence on the charges of neglecting and abusing Bella after the prosecution succeeded in establishing a prima facie case against her at the end of the prosecution case

                Siti Bainun, 31, told the court that she had appointed Mohammad Farhan Maaruf to represent her in the defence trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohammad Farhan, when confirming the matter, said he was re-appointed by Siti Bainun yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Subsequently, deputy public prosecutor Zilfinaz Abbas requested the court to record the chronology of the withdrawal of the lawyers representing Siti Bainun in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the withdrawal of the five lawyers, Siti Bainun was left with no legal representation in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Jan 26, Judge Izralizam ordered Siti Bainun to enter her defence on the charges even though she had no legal representation, saying that the proceedings should continue so as not to disrupt the progress of the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Nov 24 last year, the court ordered Siti Bainun to enter her defence on the charges of neglecting and abusing Bella after the prosecution succeeded in establishing a prima facie case against her at the end of the prosecution case

                Yeoh said she wants to co-ordinate amongst government ministries and agencies to remove “roadblocks” that stand in the way of productive investment in motorsports and “money should not be pumped in to solving bureaucracy.” “How do we make it affordable? By removing roadblocks,” Yeoh says

                During her welcome speech at the 30 Years of Malaysian Cub Prix dinner, Yeoh said finances is an issue in Malaysian motorsport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “How can we make this (motorsports) more affordable?” asks Yeoh
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yeoh said she wants to co-ordinate amongst government ministries and agencies to remove “roadblocks” that stand in the way of productive investment in motorsports and “money should not be pumped in to solving bureaucracy.” “How do we make it affordable? By removing roadblocks,” Yeoh says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “What kind of model can we put together to ensure we have more infrastructure but is not dependant on government for maintenance,” added Yeoh
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yeoh also called on organisers to make motorsports inspiring for young people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In order to inspire young people you have to give them more platforms to race safely,” Yeoh said

                Youth wing members of Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) clad in medieval Islamic war attire, marching with fake swords and shields in Setiu, Terengganu on Feb 17, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Terengganu police chief Rohaimi Md Isa, initial investigations showed that the event took place on Friday (Feb 17) at a resort in Setiu, Terengganu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Police will carry out an investigation to identify any offences in the programme and appropriate action will be taken,” he said in a statement on Monday.  Mr Rohaimi, however, said that the police were not informed about the march involving replicas of weapons, though they were notified of the event earlier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We were not informed about the march with replicas of weapons, which has caused uneasiness and concern among the public,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The march was part of a two-day PAS youth wing gathering, known as Himpunan Pemuda Islam Terengganu (HIMPIT), or Terengganu Muslim Youth Gathering.  Mr Rohaimi added that the march, which was attended by party members from various districts in the state, was part of a design competition involving the theme of clothing, weapons and Islamic heritage.  In a statement on Monday, Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail condemned the march and urged all parties to stop acts that have the potential to create chaos for the people and the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also questioned the intention of the march which was uploaded to social media with an Arabic song in the background emphasising the theme of war.  “This invites the question of whether this parade meant to inject the spirit of war,” said Mr Saifuddin

                "One of their suggestions is ride-sharing," the Transport Minister told reporters after launching the free shuttle bus service from Kuala Lumpur Sentral to Parliament complex on Monday (Feb 20)

            <p>
                Earlier this month, Loke announced that the Land Public Transport Agency (Apad) was currently looking at implementing a ride-sharing pilot project where ehailing and taxi companies offer commuter rides to the MRT stations at lower fares
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said that ridership for public transport such as the MRT (mass rapid transit) could be further increased if first and last-mile issues are resolved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a related matter, Loke said that Prasarana Malaysia Berhad (Prasarana) will look at using smaller feeder buses aimed at improving first and last-mile connectivity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this would be based on the success of the pilot project which provides a free shuttle bus service from KL Sentral and Parliament complex

                The Education Minister said that to date, the ministry does not recognise the UEC which is implemented in private Chinese secondary schools (SMPC)

            <p>
                According to Dong Zong, the SMPC adheres to a curriculum, which includes history as a subject, drafted based on the ministry's standard, as well as having Bahasa Malaysia as a compulsory subject in recognition of the national language under the Federal Constitution and Rukun Negara

                President Chow Chee Yen said the purpose of the tax reduction is to help the M40 with the rising cost of living and increase their disposable income, while the tax increase on the T20 is to alleviate the reduction in revenue collection caused by the tax cut

            <p>
                Under Budget 2023 tabled on Oct 7, 2022, by the former government, the income tax for the chargeable income band of between RM50,001 to RM100,000 was reduced by two ppt for the year of assessment 2023 -- from 13 per cent to 11 per cent for the RM50,001-RM70,000 band, and from 21 per cent to 19 per cent for the RM70,001-RM100,000 band

            <p>
                Former prime minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s administration also raised the tax for those in the chargeable income bracket of between RM250,001 and RM400,000 from 24.5 per cent to 25 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, he said the return of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) would not be on the cards as Anwar has recently stated that the government would not introduce the broad-based consumption tax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "GST is not the priority of the current government in this upcoming budget because, being a broad-based consumption tax, GST would also impact the low and middle-income households

                President Chow Chee Yen said the purpose of the tax reduction is to help the M40 with the rising cost of living and increase their disposable income, while the tax increase on the T20 is to alleviate the reduction in revenue collection caused by the tax cut
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As such, I would expect the respective tax cut of two ppt and tax increase of 0.5 ppt to be maintained,” he told Bernama via email recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under Budget 2023 tabled on Oct 7, 2022, by the former government, the income tax for the chargeable income band of between RM50,001 to RM100,000 was reduced by two ppt for the year of assessment 2023 -- from 13 per cent to 11 per cent for the RM50,001-RM70,000 band, and from 21 per cent to 19 per cent for the RM70,001-RM100,000 band
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former prime minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s administration also raised the tax for those in the chargeable income bracket of between RM250,001 and RM400,000 from 24.5 per cent to 25 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, he said the return of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) would not be on the cards as Anwar has recently stated that the government would not introduce the broad-based consumption tax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "GST is not the priority of the current government in this upcoming budget because, being a broad-based consumption tax, GST would also impact the low and middle-income households

                In terms of changes, the City facelift gets a slimmer chrome bar and a honeycomb mesh insert for its grille section

            <p>
                Meanwhile, the rear bumper has been revised to incorporate a black diffuser-like element that was absent on the pre-facelift model

            <p>
                Media outlets in India claim the City will gain more features like a wireless charger and ventilated seats as part of its facelift

            <p>
                In India, the pre-facelift City was offered with petrol and diesel engines, but the latter will likely be dropped with the introduction of the facelifted model

                In terms of changes, the City facelift gets a slimmer chrome bar and a honeycomb mesh insert for its grille section
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the rear bumper has been revised to incorporate a black diffuser-like element that was absent on the pre-facelift model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the interior, the City’s dashboard remains largely familiar, although the steering wheel controls appear to have been tweaked to now feature a volume dial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Media outlets in India claim the City will gain more features like a wireless charger and ventilated seats as part of its facelift
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In India, the pre-facelift City was offered with petrol and diesel engines, but the latter will likely be dropped with the introduction of the facelifted model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gonna feel claustrophobic inside Go ride a horse then Its a shame City don’t have front parking sensor…at least should be offered in the Top Spec Nice b segment sedan, if s spec 80k got leather seat and reverse camera just nice

                Erik ten Hag is enjoying a successful first season at Manchester United, but is facing a battle to keep one of his star players after the club recently imposed a wage cap  Erik ten Hag appears ready to ignore a recently imposed wage cap in order to keep Marcus Rashford at Manchester United for the long term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the Daily Star, United have offered Rashford a contract worth £300,000 per week

            <p>
                But the offer on the table for Rashford would appear to break a wage cap that was imposed in the wake of Cristiano Ronaldo's departure

                Premier League • England Manchester United are willing to stretch to a £250,000 per week wage to keep David de Gea at Old Trafford, according to reports.  But, Erik ten Hag is allegedly already looking at bringing in Leeds United shot-stopper Illan Meslier as his long-term replacement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This new, reported offer is somewhat unexpected, given Ten Hag introduced a rule this season that no United player could earn more than £200,000 per week.  But, the fact that the Dutch coach is willing to compromise to keep De Gea at the club, shows how important he is to the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, according to the Sun, Ten Hag is willing to offer his goalkeeper £200,000 per week to keep him at Old Trafford for at least next season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite De Gea clearly still being important to United, he is already 32 years old, so they are already thinking about a more long-term addition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the Sun’s report, United are very interested in making a move for Leeds’ shot-stopper Meslier and are willing to wait until they can offer him a starting spot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At just 22 years old, the keeper has the potential to get even better than he already is, so United will be hoping that they can seal a deal in the future

                About Us Advertise SEPANG, Feb 19 — Five stranded Malaysians in Thailand were rescued by Malaysian authorities after falling prey to job scams following a successful meeting with Malaysia authorities and Thailand counterparts earlier this week, Bukit Aman Crime Investigation Department’s director Datuk Seri Abd Jalil Hassan said today

                The operating licences of Lynas Malaysia were extended until March 2, 2026

            <p>
                Lynas has since criticised the decision and said it could result in hundreds of job losses

                However, Chang said no C&L activities can be carried out in the Lynas Advanced Materials Plant in Gebeng after July this year

                About Us Advertise SYDNEY, Feb 19 — The death toll from Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand climbed to 11 today as thousands of people remained missing a week after the storm struck the country’s North Island
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cyclone hit the North Island’s uppermost region on February 12 and tracked down the east coast, inflicting widespread devastation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, police said two more people had died in the hard-hit Hawke’s Bay area in circumstances related to the cyclone, raising the death toll to 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some 5,608 people remained uncontactable across the country, while 1,196 had registered they were safe, police said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of those, almost 40,000 were in Hawke’s Bay, out of a population of about 170,000

            <p>
                Prime Minister Hipkins has said the crisis response is “still underway” and that people across the North Island are “working around the clock.” Police have sent an extra 100 officers to Hawke’s Bay and nearby Tairawhiti, including to isolated areas, and the New Zealand Herald reported roadblocks around a rural Hawke’s Bay village to deter looters

                Liverpool could be in the market for a defensive player in the summer as Jürgen Klopp's staff look to steal a march on Premier League rivals for a 19-year-old talent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With this in mind, one would posit that Klopp's staff are already working in the background to ensure that Liverpool's squad remains future-proofed

            <p>
                With Trent Alexander Arnold and youngster Calvin Ramsay possibly representing Liverpool's long-term options in the right full-back areas, it would perhaps make more sense for Mantilla to, therefore, be a long-term option for the Reds in the centre of defense

                With question marks currently surrounding Joel Matip's long-term future at Liverpool — he has less than 18 months left on his current contract — one would posit that it makes perfect sense that Jürgen Klopp's staff would be scouring the market for a successor

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, the 19-year-old's ability to potentially play a number of positions across the backline would surely make him an asset for the majority of clubs, including Liverpool

                The Blues' misery under Graham Potter continued on Saturday afternoon, as the Premier League's basement side Southampton won 1-0 at Stamford Bridge thanks to James Ward-Prowse's free kick
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Blues are also facing a last-16 exit from the Champions League following a 1-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund in Wednesday's first leg, with the German side set to visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg on March 7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Out-of-favour striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is also expected to be heading for the exit door at the end of the season, having recently been frozen out of the group under Potter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former Arsenal man was left out of the Blues' Champions League squad for the knockout stages and has also been cut from the ranks for each of their last three Premier League matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                © Reuters As is the case with Mount, Aubameyang's contract at Stamford Bridge only runs until 2024, and he has just three goals to show from 17 appearances at the club since arriving from Barcelona
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Hakim Ziyech, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Conor Gallagher are also viewed as expendable assets by Chelsea, who were on the verge of offloading the former to Paris Saint-Germain on loan in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Loftus-Cheek now has fewer than 18 months left on his Blues contract, and he has only played 79 minutes of Premier League football for Potter's side since the World Cup

                The Blues' misery under Graham Potter continued on Saturday afternoon, as the Premier League's basement side Southampton won 1-0 at Stamford Bridge thanks to James Ward-Prowse's free kick
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Blues are also facing a last-16 exit from the Champions League following a 1-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund in Wednesday's first leg, with the German side set to visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg on March 7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Out-of-favour striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is also expected to be heading for the exit door at the end of the season, having recently been frozen out of the group under Potter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former Arsenal man was left out of the Blues' Champions League squad for the knockout stages and has also been cut from the ranks for each of their last three Premier League matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                © Reuters As is the case with Mount, Aubameyang's contract at Stamford Bridge only runs until 2024, and he has just three goals to show from 17 appearances at the club since arriving from Barcelona
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Hakim Ziyech, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Conor Gallagher are also viewed as expendable assets by Chelsea, who were on the verge of offloading the former to Paris Saint-Germain on loan in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Loftus-Cheek now has fewer than 18 months left on his Blues contract, and he has only played 79 minutes of Premier League football for Potter's side since the World Cup

                Liverpool recorded one of their most important wins of the season by beating Newcastle, with the media assessing what could be a major turning point in the top-four this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here’s a look at how the watching media reacted to Liverpool’s win, on a big night in the Champions League battle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This was Liverpool’s trademark, this was their thing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They did it as well as any side in Europe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                […] “Monday’s 2-0 win against a poor Everton team at Anfield was a big one for the morale at Liverpool, but this was a more significant victory because they did it against a Newcastle side that had been unbeaten at home all season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is why Klopp will be elated with the outcome, not simply because it means Newcastle will feel the threat of Liverpool moving closer to the top-four place the Toon Army also have their eyes on
            </p>

                Speaking at the EU-Asean Youth Diplomats Programme at Universiti Malaya here today, Yeoh said that PH’s pledge to ban child marriage in the run-up to the 2018 election had led to high expectations that the goal would immediately be realised when the coalition won GE14

            <p>
                The four kinds of child marriage Yeoh referred to were Muslims marriages under the Shariah courts, non-Muslim marriages, traditional or adat marriages involving the Orang Asli in the peninsula, as well as adat marriages involving indigenous communities in Sabah and Sarawak

            <p>
                In January 2020, Dr Wan Azizah launched a five-year National Strategy Plan to end child marriage that involved agencies from the federal government as well as the state government, non-governmental organisations and international organisations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yeoh said that the long road to the eradication of child marriage should be a lesson to young hopefuls to not “rush into a solution without understanding the complexity of the matter”

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January 2020, Dr Wan Azizah launched a five-year National Strategy Plan to end child marriage that involved agencies from the federal government as well as the state government, non-governmental organisations and international organisations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yeoh said that the long road to the eradication of child marriage should be a lesson to young hopefuls to not “rush into a solution without understanding the complexity of the matter”

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb 19 — Singapore and Malaysia’s police have arrested 12 people in a joint operation involving several raids in Johor, as they busted a "fake friend call scam" syndicate that targeted Singaporeans
            </p>

                In the scam, a person pretending to be the victim’s friend will call to ask for financial assistance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The syndicate is believed to be involved in more than 360 reported cases, with total losses of more than S$1.3 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since January this year, more than 490 victims have fallen prey to such a scam, with at least S$1.7 million lost in total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Initial investigations found that the syndicate started its scam operations sometime in December 2022 and was using Singapore prepaid SIM cards to make calls to unsuspecting victims in the Republic

                Welcome to the ESPN Singapore Edition Mark Ogden believes Liverpool will secure a Champions League finish after their 2-0 win over Newcastle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez, 23, scored his first Premier League goal since before the World Cup to set Liverpool on course for a 2-0 win over Newcastle at St James' Park on Saturday -- a win which moves Jurgen Klopp's team up to eighth, six points behind fourth-placed Newcastle with a game in hand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Nunez has hurt his shoulder and he needs further assessment," Klopp said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We don't know any more at the moment, we will have to see, but it is painful for him." Despite closing the gap on Newcastle to revive Liverpool's hopes of a top four finish, Klopp said it is too early to gauge whether his team have finally turned a corner this season
            </p>

                The Reds ended Newcastle's 17-match unbeaten run in the Premier League with a 2-0 win at St James' Park on Saturday.  Jurgen Klopp's side caught Newcastle cold with a scintillating start and the stunned hosts were reduced to ten men in the 22nd minute when Pope was sent off.  The French winger, 25, described the match as 'a very bad day' and pointed out that Pope will miss the Carabao Cup final against Manchester United next Sunday

                To play ten men against them is very bad - we need to be focused for the cup final.  'I am disappointed about the game because it's important to win before the final - when you play in a final, it's to win.'

                Premier League • England Everton have sent ’emissaries’ to keep a close eye on Benfica midfielder Florentino Luis, who they are ‘in love with,’ according to reports.  The Toffees were the only Premier League side not to make any signings in January, so Sean Dyche will be in need of reinforcements this summer, regardless of whether they avoid relegation or not
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Record, via Sport Witness, Everton are ‘in love’ with Florentino and sent ’emissaries’ (scouts) to watch him in Benfica’s 2-0 win over Club Brugge on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, if Florentino could keep up his current form in the Premier League for the Blues next season, he could help turn them into a much better side

                However, Liverpool have also registered an interest in the midfielder, so Everton could have some serious competition on their hands for his signature

            <p>
                Everton have endured another very difficult start to the season, currently sitting in 16th place after winning just five of their 23 opening Premier League matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If they want to avoid another relegation scrap next season (if they survive), Everton need to improve their squad significantly, and signing Florentino would be a marvellous start

                United boss Erik ten Hag confirmed before the game that Maguire's absence was injury related
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Ten Hag doesn't think Maguire's injury will see him sidelined for too long

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag's side take on Barcelona this Thursday in the return leg of their Europa League clash, three days before the Carabao Cup final meeting with Newcastle

                About Us Advertise THE HAGUE, Feb 19 — The Dutch foreign ministry yesterday announced the expulsion of several Russian diplomats and the closure of Russia’s trade mission in Amsterdam, accusing Moscow of using diplomatic cover for spying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was the latest development in a dispute over Russia’s failure to grant visas to Dutch diplomats to staff their embassy in Moscow and the consulate in Saint Petersburg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That is why we are limiting the number of Russian diplomats in the Netherlands.” The Russian diplomats being told to leave have two weeks to depart the country, while Russia’s trade mission in Amsterdam had to be closed from Tuesday, said the ministry statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hoekstra told Dutch broadcaster NOS that he expected around a dozen Russian diplomats would have to leave the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In response, Russia expelled 15 Dutch diplomats, and since then talks on naming new diplomats to each country have failed, the Dutch government said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, “the Russian embassy in The Hague will not be able to have more diplomats than the Dutch embassy in Moscow”, it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dutch media reported that the Dutch ambassador to Russia was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry earlier this week, as Moscow demanded that the Netherlands end its “obsessive” attempts to blame Russia for the disaster

            <p>
                “The Badmintion Association of Malaysia (BAM) needs to have a discussion about team events and prepare well to ensure the team reaches the final,” he said when met recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team needed to find their winning rhythm so that their confidence would turn into fighting spirit that they can use at the upcoming championship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I made my comeback during the Sudirman Cup in China previously, where I forced myself to not lose a single match
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s loss at the BAMTC is unsurprising as it is the third quarterfinal loss in the country’s history of participating in the championship, having lost previously in 2017 in Hanoi, Vietnam and in 2019 in Hong Kong

                The 2021 edition in Wuhan, China was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic

                Local advocacy group Family Frontiers and the Malaysian chapter of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR Malaysia) were swift in commending the Cabinet for agreeing to amend the Federal Constitution so that children born abroad to Malaysian mothers can gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia has for decades been stuck with citizenship laws that were seen as unfair and discriminatory against women, as the Federal Constitution only granted automatic Malaysian citizenship to children born overseas to Malaysian men with foreign wives, but not Malaysian women with foreign husbands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Malaysian mothers were not able to fly back to Malaysia to give birth due to high-risk pregnancies or did not even know the government would reject Malaysian citizenship for their children just because they were born abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also the risk of Malaysian mothers' overseas-born children ending up stateless, such as in the case of Mashithah Abdul Halim whose youngest child is stateless or without citizenship from any country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Family Frontiers thanked the Cabinet and welcomed its decision to bring the proposed legal changes to Parliament to allow Malaysian mothers the right to confer citizenship on their overseas-born children on the same basis as Malaysian fathers, calling this a "significant step forward"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Family Frontiers president Suriani Kempe said the Malaysian mothers are awaiting for the Malaysian government to table the proposed changes to the Federal Constitution's citizenship laws

                Based on the inquiries made to Mita's members, Uzaidi was reported saying that Malaysia estimates one million tourist arrivals from China who are expected to spend RM1.5 billion (US$341 million) in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tourism is a key source of income in Malaysia and accounted for 6.8 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A check by Malay Mail of Tourism Malaysia's figures showed that Malaysia had enjoyed as many as 26.7 million international tourists arrivals in 2016, followed by 25.9 million (2017), 25.8 million (2018), 26.1 million (2019), but that this slowed down during the pandemic to just 4.3 million in 2020 and 134,728 in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tourism Malaysia's data showed Malaysia also saw its international tourists spending around RM82 billion here in 2016 and 2017, RM84.1 billion in 2018 and RM86.1 billion in 2019, before it plunged to over RM12.68 billion in 2020 and RM238.7 million in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tourists from China to Malaysia once numbered 3.1 million in 2019, but fell to 405,149 in 2020, and only 7,701 in 2021, the latest publicly-available Tourism Malaysia data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China tourists accounted for RM15.3 billion of the total RM86.1 billion tourist receipts for Malaysia in 2019

                Based on the inquiries made to Mita's members, Uzaidi was reported saying that Malaysia estimates one million tourist arrivals from China who are expected to spend RM1.5 billion (US$341 million) in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tourism is a key source of income in Malaysia and accounted for 6.8 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A check by Malay Mail of Tourism Malaysia's figures showed that Malaysia had enjoyed as many as 26.7 million international tourists arrivals in 2016, followed by 25.9 million (2017), 25.8 million (2018), 26.1 million (2019), but that this slowed down during the pandemic to just 4.3 million in 2020 and 134,728 in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tourism Malaysia's data showed Malaysia also saw its international tourists spending around RM82 billion here in 2016 and 2017, RM84.1 billion in 2018 and RM86.1 billion in 2019, before it plunged to over RM12.68 billion in 2020 and RM238.7 million in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tourists from China to Malaysia once numbered 3.1 million in 2019, but fell to 405,149 in 2020, and only 7,701 in 2021, the latest publicly-available Tourism Malaysia data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China tourists accounted for RM15.3 billion of the total RM86.1 billion tourist receipts for Malaysia in 2019

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb18 — Singapore has recorded its first Covid-19 vaccine-related death after the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced yesterday that a 28-year-old Bangladeshi man likely died due to a vaccination against the coronavirus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The coroner also found that on the balance of probabilities, it was “likely to be related to Covid-19 vaccination”, MOH said without naming the deceased
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the ministry’s Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme, a one-time financial aid of S$225,000 (RM 745,793.13) will be extended to the man’s family

                “MOH is working with the Ministry of Manpower to extend assistance to his family and facilitate their application,” MOH added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also said that to date, more than 17 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in Singapore through the national vaccination programme and this is “the first death related to Covid-19 vaccination locally”

            <p>
                “This will enable early diagnosis and appropriate medical management of any rare severe adverse events that may occur after vaccination.” MOH said that along with the expert committee on Covid-19 vaccination and HSA, it will continue to monitor vaccine-related serious adverse events closely

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 18 — The Cabinet has agreed to amend the Federal Constitution to enable children born abroad to Malaysian mothers to gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Federal Constitution currently only provides automatic citizenship for children born overseas to Malaysian fathers, while Malaysian mothers are required to apply for their overseas-born children to be registered as Malaysian citizens with no guarantee of success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The only difference for such overseas-born children is whether their Malaysian parent is a father or mother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is despite an amendment to Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution in September 2001 to stop gender discrimination
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Six Malaysian mothers and advocacy group Family Frontiers on December 18, 2020 launched a legal challenge against the discrimination against women in the current citizenship laws in the Federal Constitution which were depriving their overseas-born children of automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian mothers and Family Frontiers on September 9, 2021 succeeded at the High Court which ruled that their overseas-born children are also entitled to Malaysian citizenship, but the Malaysian government on August 5, 2022 won its appeal in a 2-1 decision at the Court of Appeal

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The only difference for such overseas-born children is whether their Malaysian parent is a father or mother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is despite an amendment to Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution in September 2001 to stop gender discrimination
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Six Malaysian mothers and advocacy group Family Frontiers on December 18, 2020 launched a legal challenge against the discrimination against women in the current citizenship laws in the Federal Constitution which were depriving their overseas-born children of automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian mothers and Family Frontiers on September 9, 2021 succeeded at the High Court which ruled that their overseas-born children are also entitled to Malaysian citizenship, but the Malaysian government on August 5, 2022 won its appeal in a 2-1 decision at the Court of Appeal

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb 18 — Google Singapore yesterday confirmed that it has laid off an unspecified number of employees at its Singapore office, a day after the global technology giant’s India office retrenched more than 450 staff members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In response to queries from TODAY, Google Singapore said that the firm is “unable to share the number of employees impacted in Singapore”, but said that the workers are “part of the 12,000 roles affected globally as previously announced”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google Singapore added yesterday that Google will “support employees in line with local practices as they look for their next opportunity”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Checks by TODAY on professional networking site LinkedIn showed that several laid-off and retained Google Singapore staff members had made mention of the retrenchment exercise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One claimed that the number of layoffs in Singapore was 190 employees but TODAY has not been able to verify that figure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Singapore Ministry of Manpower said last November that 1,270 workers were laid off in the Singapore tech sector between July and November last year

                About Us Advertise LONDON, Feb 18 — The US partner of global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has confirmed that a trading firm managed by Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng operated as a market maker on its platform
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters reported on Thursday, citing banking records and company messages, that Binance had secret access to a bank account belonging to its purportedly independent US partner and transferred large sums of money from the account to the trading firm, Merit Peak Ltd “While there was a market making firm named Merit Peak that operated on the Binance.US platform, it stopped all activity on the platform in 2021,” Binance.US said in a tweet on Thursday after the Reuters story was published
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The global Binance exchange is not licensed to operate in the United States but the transfers to Merit Peak revealed by Reuters suggest that Binance controlled the finances of Binance.US, despite saying publicly that the American entity is “fully independent” and operates as its “US partner.” Binance transferred over US$400 million from the account at California-based Silvergate Bank to Merit Peak between January and March of 2021, Reuters reported on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before that story’s publication, Binance.US had told Reuters that “Merit Peak is neither trading nor providing any kind of services on the Binance.US platform,” without giving further details
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A spokesperson for the global Binance exchange, which did not respond to Reuters’ questions for the story on Thursday, told crypto news outlet CoinDesk that the transfers were “a Binance.US issue.” Zhao, the Binance CEO, said yesterday that the global exchange has pulled back on potential investments in the United States, a move that comes amid growing scrutiny by US regulators of crypto companies so far this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They fell sharply on the Reuters report on Thursday, losing more than 22 per cent

                Schectman, who has three decades of experience in the precious metals sector, said that the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) coalition could lead the charge to develop their own reserve currency which would compete against the U.S
            </p>

            <p>
                And if they all start to dump dollars, and I think it would happen quickly, you would have a tsunami of inflation hitting the shores of the West.” To find out why oil is so important to Schectman’s thesis, watch the video above CBDCs and The Great Reset As dollars return to the United States, this “would immediately create a spike in interest rates to compensate for the loss of purchasing power,” said Schectman

                (Reuters) -     Lee Mason has left the referees' body PGMOL by mutual agreement after making a mistake as the Video Assistant Referee in last weekend's 1-1 Premier League draw between Arsenal and Brentford, Professional Game Match Officials Limited said on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PGMOL said later on Sunday that the decisions which went against both Arsenal and also Brighton & Hove Albion in Saturday's league matches were down to "human error"

            <p>
                "PGMOL can confirm that Video Assistant Referee Lee Mason has departed the organisation by mutual consent," the referees body said in a statement on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mason, a Premier League referee for 15 years, oversaw 287 top-flight matches during that time, with his last coming in the closing stages of the 2021-22 season
            </p>

                The duo are creating a goalscoring chance for one another every 52 minutes they are on the pitch together making their partnership statistically the best rate of any partnership to play 1000+ mins together in the Premier League this season

                In the 337 minutes he has played so far for Liverpool, Gakpo has outperformed both Salah and Nunez for dribbles, managing a 57.1% success rate that is only beaten by currently-injured Luis Diaz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the 14 league games he has managed this season, Firmino has bagged seven goals, one less than Salah and in 805 minutes fewer

            <p>
                Firmino also records Liverpool's highest shot conversion rate of 21.2% per 90 minutes, closely followed by fellow injured star Diaz, 18.8%

            <p>
                Diaz has become one of the Premier League's most explosive attackers since joining the club midway through last season and has been a huge miss in attack for the Reds

                In his notice of motion filed on Feb 13, Ahmad Zahid said the High Court’s dismissal would prejudice his rights and responsibilities as he would have to officially apply to get access to his passport each time he needed to leave the country for official work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is seeking for the Court of Appeal to reconsider his application for a permanent release of his passport and says that he is ready to accept any conditions imposed by the court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his supporting affidavit, Ahmad Zahid said Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah erred when he rejected his application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his supporting affidavit to the application, Ahmad Zahid said he was given the mandate and responsibility by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to appear on his behalf at several administrative functions

                In a statement posted on Facebook on Saturday (Feb 18), it said minister Hannah Yeoh, during her press conference on Feb 16, was only urging the private sector to emulate the government's paid internship policies

                On Feb 16, Yeoh responded to a question from Muar MP Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman during a press conference in Parliament, urging the government to implement paid internship programmes in the private sector

                Liverpool is preparing to welcome back a number of key names to the squad as they prepare to face their rivals in the race for the Premier League top-four spots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One senses that the German will have one eye on next week's Champions League game against Real Madrid when it comes to picking his team to face Newcastle, however
            </p>

                One could argue that this is the more important game, given that Liverpool may not make it past the last 16 in the Champions League if they come unstuck against Real Madrid over two legs

                A United States Air Force F-35 fighter jet taxis during the Aero India 2023 air show at Yelahanka air base in Bengaluru on Feb 13, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                India, desperate to modernise its largely Soviet-era fighter jet fleet to boost its air power, is concerned about Russian supply delays due to the Ukraine war and has faced pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The American delegation to the week-long Aero India show in Bengaluru, which ends on Friday (Feb 17), is the biggest in the 27-year history of the show and underlines the growing strategic relationship between the United States and India
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At previous editions of the show, Rosoboronexport had a more central position for its stall, although Russia has not brought a fighter jet to Bengaluru for a decade after India began considering more European and US fighter jets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The F-35 is not being considered by India "as of now", according to an Indian Air Force (IAF) source, but the display of two F-35s at Aero India for the first time was a sign of New Delhi's growing strategic importance to Washington

                A United States Air Force F-35 fighter jet taxis during the Aero India 2023 air show at Yelahanka air base in Bengaluru on Feb 13, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                India, desperate to modernise its largely Soviet-era fighter jet fleet to boost its air power, is concerned about Russian supply delays due to the Ukraine war and has faced pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The American delegation to the week-long Aero India show in Bengaluru, which ends on Friday (Feb 17), is the biggest in the 27-year history of the show and underlines the growing strategic relationship between the United States and India
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At previous editions of the show, Rosoboronexport had a more central position for its stall, although Russia has not brought a fighter jet to Bengaluru for a decade after India began considering more European and US fighter jets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The F-35 is not being considered by India "as of now", according to an Indian Air Force (IAF) source, but the display of two F-35s at Aero India for the first time was a sign of New Delhi's growing strategic importance to Washington

                When asked if it would be offered to India, Rear Admiral Michael L Baker, defence attache at the US embassy in India, said that New Delhi was in the "very early stages" of considering whether it wanted the plane

                Eleven days after the quake - now one of the 10 deadliest of the past 100 years - Turkish rescuers pulled a 17-year-old girl and a woman in her 20s out of the rubble

                Hasan Irmak saw five family members - including his six-year-old daughter Belinda - buried under his flattened house in the Syrian border region town of Samandag

            <p>
                "She was alive for two days," the 57-year-old said of his daughter

                On the third day, she was dead

                Azalina pointed out that the Sulu heirs' bid to seize Malaysia's assets is based on the alleged arbitration award by Gonzalo Stampa --- whose appointment as arbitrator has been cancelled by the same court which appointed him initially
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if such a second seizure order does exist, Azalina said Malaysia will fight off such bids in the courts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 24 this year, the District Court of Luxembourg decided to lift or set aside a seizure order on two Petronas subsidiaries and their assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seizure order was previously issued last July 11 upon request of the alleged Sulu heirs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 30, Azalina said Malaysia is also currently challenging an ex parte Exequatur Order — or a May 18, 2022 order which recognised Stampa's purported arbitration award in Luxembourg — before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia continues to dispute the appointment of Stampa as arbitrator and also challenges the entire arbitration process and his award in favour of the Sulu claimants as invalid and illegal

                Thanks to Erik ten Hag's tactics, Manchester United scored twice in seven second-half minutes to stun Barcelona and set up an intriguing second leg in the Europa League  Manchester United arrived in Barcelona hindered by injuries to play an in-form side in a stadium they had never beaten them in before

            <p>
                Marcos Alonso’s back-post header from a corner put the home side in front before United sprung into life

                Despite his annoyance at not getting more, it was an impressive night for United

                President of Malaysia Gold Association (MGA) Datuk Wira Louis Ng (second, right) and Singapore Bullion Market Assocation Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Albert Cheng (third, right) purchased a gold bar using a gold automated teller machine (ATM) during a Malaysia Gold Conference 2023 today.

                Public Gold Group has launched its first gold dispensing ATM known as Malaysia Gold ATM, at Menara Public Gold, Tun Razak Exchange to enable consumers to purchase physical gold bars conveniently.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Malaysia Gold ATM enabled consumers to purchase physical gold bars with 999.9 purity, which ranges up to five grams per bar, at great convenience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides that, he said keeping physical gold is an excellent way to hedge against inflation and with the current economic situation in Malaysia, more locals should consider keeping physical gold to safeguard their existing wealth

            <p>

                President of Malaysia Gold Association (MGA) Datuk Wira Louis Ng (second, right) and Singapore Bullion Market Assocation Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Albert Cheng (third, right) purchased a gold bar using a gold automated teller machine (ATM) during a Malaysia Gold Conference 2023 today.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Public Gold Group has launched its first gold dispensing ATM known as Malaysia Gold ATM, at Menara Public Gold, Tun Razak Exchange to enable consumers to purchase physical gold bars conveniently.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Malaysia Gold ATM enabled consumers to purchase physical gold bars with 999.9 purity, which ranges up to five grams per bar, at great convenience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides that, he said keeping physical gold is an excellent way to hedge against inflation and with the current economic situation in Malaysia, more locals should consider keeping physical gold to safeguard their existing wealth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Ng, who is also the Malaysia Gold Association (MGA) president said the inaugural one-day Malaysia Gold Conference 2023 is set to bring the local gold industry to greater heights
            </p>
            
            <p>

                The judge questioned whether prosecutors’ proposal to largely ban Bankman-Fried’s internet use went far enough, citing the risk he could use his parents’ unmonitored devices
            </p>

                Bankman-Fried’s communications became an issue when prosecutors said he sought to contact FTX’s current chief executive John Ray, and an in-house lawyer

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 — The proposal to make it compulsory to pay allowances to students who undergo industrial training in the private sector will discourage employers from offering places for internship, said the Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement today, MEF president Datuk Syed Hussain Syed Husman said instead of compelling employers to pay internship allowance, the government should consider giving more incentives to the employers to take in more interns and make it mandatory for all undergraduates to undergo internship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “MEF is of the view that employers should pay internship allowance at their discretion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is advisable for employers that take interns to pay some allowance to the interns, and employers taking in interns need to take into consideration rising costs of living faced by the interns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, private companies that take in interns to undergo industrial training pay allowances at their discretion, with the average allowance in bigger cities for an intern being about RM1,200, but some are paid less than RM1,000 per month

                Yeo said about four years ago, the then-Pakatan Harapan government imposed a pre-condition for Lynas' licence renewal to remove its radioactive waste from Malaysia according to its two letters of undertaking to the government in 2012

                Under the new condition, Yeo said Lynas had four years to build a cracking and leaching facility elsewhere and upon its completion, Lynas would no longer be allowed to produce radioactive waste in Malaysia and only the intermediates would be allowed to be shipped here for further processing

                In its Annual Economic Statistic 2021, DOSM said the manufacturing sector remains a primary contributor with a 50.1 per cent share, or RM1.61 trillion, of the value of gross output and a 17.4 per cent annual percentage change

            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said the value added for all economic sectors in 2021 grew 8.1 per cent, with an increase of RM93.8 billion to RM1.25 trillion against RM1.16 trillion in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The services sector, with a share of 52.6 per cent, was the prime mover to the economy, with its value-added rebounding 1.7 per cent to RM658.2 billion in 2021 compared to RM647 billion in 2020,” it said

                DoSM said this was followed by the manufacturing sector with a 14.6 per cent growth with RM355.1 billion value added

                As she proceeded to go to the lift, security guards blocked her path told the businesswoman that her dress length was considered too short and that the skirt length has to touch the floor to be considered appropriate attire for the building

                A Japanese justice ministry panel has proposed raising the country's age of consent, currently among the world's lowest at just 13, as part of a major overhaul of sex crime legislation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move to raise the age of consent to 16 is part of a package of reforms that would also clarify rape prosecution requirements and criminalise voyeurism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan's age of consent, the lowest among the G7 industrialised nations, has stayed unchanged since its enactment in 1907
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The age of consent is 16 in Britain and South Korea, 15 in France, and 14 in Germany and China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under current Japanese law, children at least 13 years old are considered capable of consent, meaning sexual activity with them is not considered statutory rape
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan, it added, should redefine "the crime of rape as all non-consensual sexual intercourse"

                A Japanese justice ministry panel has proposed raising the country's age of consent, currently among the world's lowest at just 13, as part of a major overhaul of sex crime legislation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move to raise the age of consent to 16 is part of a package of reforms that would also clarify rape prosecution requirements and criminalise voyeurism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan's age of consent, the lowest among the G7 industrialised nations, has stayed unchanged since its enactment in 1907
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The age of consent is 16 in Britain and South Korea, 15 in France, and 14 in Germany and China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under current Japanese law, children at least 13 years old are considered capable of consent, meaning sexual activity with them is not considered statutory rape
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan, it added, should redefine "the crime of rape as all non-consensual sexual intercourse"

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 — Pejuang state assemblyman Harumaini Omar has reportedly denied that he was absent from the assembly sittings for six months, after he was thrown out and his Batang Kali seat declared vacant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Selangor state assembly Speaker Ng Suee Lim made the announcement that the Batang Kali seat is now vacant following Haruiman’s absence without leave for more than six months since July 28
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Ng, a by-election will not be called since Harumaini has been holding his seat for more than two years since his term begins in the 2018 Selangor state election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng said the declaration of Harumaini’s Batang Kali seat as vacant was done in accordance with Article LXIX of the 1959 Selangor state constitution, and that he would notify the Election Commission (EC) soon regarding the declaration of vacancy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malay Mail’s check of the Selangor state constitution’s Article LXIX shows the provision stating that the Selangor state assembly Speaker is to declare a state seat as vacant, if that state assemblyman has been absent for more than six months without the Speaker’s leave or permission in each sitting for a period of six months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Harumaini, who first won the Batang Kali state seat in the 2018 Selangor state election, was reported on August 15, 2020 to have quit Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia and expressed support for Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad who had at the time formed a new party called Parti Pejuang Tanah Air.

                A source, who is currently with GTA, alleged to Malay Mail that the move was a deliberate one because the Pejuang faction aligned with Mukhriz is keen to take over the party leadership and forge new alliances

                A source, who is currently with GTA, alleged to Malay Mail that the move was a deliberate one because the Pejuang faction aligned with Mukhriz is keen to take over the party leadership and forge new alliances

            <p>
                He said the majority of Pejuang members had decided that the party would be better off distancing itself from GTA

                The judge questioned whether prosecutors’ proposal to largely ban Bankman-Fried’s internet use went far enough, citing the risk he could use his parents’ unmonitored devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are professors at Stanford Law School
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the prosecutors, Nicolas Roos, acknowledged that the government was not monitoring other devices in the home, but said having Bankman-Fried stay there was “a check against some other risks — risks that come from being unmonitored and by yourself.” The hearing came after prosecutors asked Kaplan to ban Bankman-Fried from using the internet except to review evidence against him or use email on his Gmail account, citing his use of a virtual private network (VPN) that could have let him hide some online activity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried’s communications became an issue when prosecutors said he sought to contact FTX’s current chief executive John Ray, and an in-house lawyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They also said Bankman-Fried’s recent use of a VPN was benign — to watch National Football League playoff games on a subscription he had bought while living in the Bahamas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried has acknowledged inadequate risk management, but said he did not steal any funds

                Arsenal's midweek defeat to Man City has sent a clear message to owner Stan Kroenke about what must be done in the summer transfer window Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters Heading into Wednesday's clash with Man City, there was no doubt that Arsenal deserved to be where they were in the league table

                The Saints have won just four games in the league this season so this match has come at the perfect time for Graham Potter and his men

            </p>

                It has since fallen to 425,000 yuan a tonne, down almost 30 per cent from the peak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sales of new energy cars, a category including both pure electric cars and plug-in hybrids, fell 6.3 per cent in January after growth of 90 per cent in 2022, according to the China Passenger Car Association
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The gross profit margin for CATL's EV battery products was 15 per cent in the first half of 2022, 8 per cent lower than the same period a year ago.

                Lilly-Spells pointed to Dorsey's earlier decisions to shield from public view the results of police investigations, a 2010 confidentiality agreement between Ronaldo and Mayorga and allegedly stolen records of attorney-client discussions between Ronaldo and his lawyers

            <p>
                Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn Dorsey's dismissal last June of Mayorga's lawsuit, filed in September 2018 in state court and moved in January 2019 to federal court

                Stovall argued that Mayorga, now 39, had learning disabilities as a child and was so pressured by Ronaldo's attorneys and representatives that she was in no condition to consent to dropping a criminal complaint she filed shortly after her encounter with Ronaldo and accepting the £311,156 ($375,000)

            <p>
                Dorsey's ruling on Tuesday was notable for the amount of the penalty she imposed -- just £33,190 ($40,000) less than the amount Stovall has acknowledged that Mayorga received in 2010

                Billionaire investor Charlie Munger reaffirmed his love for one of the world's most well-known value retailers and Yahoo Finance's 2022 Company of the Year — Costco (COST)

                Now is not a good time to be working in Britain’s car industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it is the announcement of several thousand job losses at Ford that will send the biggest shockwaves through the global car sector – 3,800 in total, 2,300 of which will come in Germany, 1,300 in the UK, and the remaining 200 across the rest of Europe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the central premises of net zero is that the resulting job destruction in old industries such as car-making, but also oil and gas exploration, construction and farming, will be more than offset by the job creation in green industries such as renewable energy – but if the remarks of Ford Germany’s boss Martin Sander are anything to go by, that looks doubtful at best

            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is why we have to make the adjustments.” Ford’s intervention is particularly significant because it is possible to extrapolate from the latest round of job cuts and arrive at an approximate figure for the industry as a whole as it goes electric

            <p>
                But having been a late adopter, Ford is now among those leading the charge with a pledge to boost spending on electric vehicles to $50bn (£41bn), from $30bn previously, by 2026 and run its electric car unit separately from its legacy combustion engine operations, in a move aimed at catching trailblazer Tesla

                How the Saver’s Credit Works The Saver’s Credit — originally called the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit — was created by the government in the early 2000s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The maximum value of the credit is $1,000 ($2,000 for couples filing jointly)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Remember that this is a tax credit, not a tax deduction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Let’s say you owe $1,500 in taxes and you have a $1,000 saver’s credit; now you owe just $500
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The New Saver’s Match The Saver’s Credit will still be around for a few years, but in 2027 it will be replaced by the Saver’s Match
            </p>

                How the Saver’s Credit Works The Saver’s Credit — originally called the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit — was created by the government in the early 2000s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The maximum value of the credit is $1,000 ($2,000 for couples filing jointly)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Remember that this is a tax credit, not a tax deduction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Let’s say you owe $1,500 in taxes and you have a $1,000 saver’s credit; now you owe just $500
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The New Saver’s Match The Saver’s Credit will still be around for a few years, but in 2027 it will be replaced by the Saver’s Match

                Keita is out of contract at the end of the season and Football Insider claim that Liverpool put an end to contract extension talks in January after the Guinea international refused to accept a pay cut

                THE Isuzu D-Max X-Terrain shocked the trucking world when it was introduced about two years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the X-Terrain changed all that and proved that Isuzu knew how to make a pick-up truck that was at home both at the farm and in the urban jungle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Isuzu D-Max X-Terrain was so well received that Isuzu Malaysia even sponsored the ultra-chic 2022 KL Fashion Week in a bid to position the D-Max X-Terrain as the pick-up truck of choice for those who wanted something that bridged both worlds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And for 2023, Isuzu is taking it further by introducing updated D-Max models including a new X-Terrain, one that will appeal to those who wanted just a little bit more from an already very capable pick-up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The exterior of the new X-Terrain is further distinguished by a new darkened front grille that also features fang like appendices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new X-Terrain also offers a new wireless charge pad with a 15W output that makes it great for a quick juice up while on the go

                THE Isuzu D-Max X-Terrain shocked the trucking world when it was introduced about two years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the X-Terrain changed all that and proved that Isuzu knew how to make a pick-up truck that was at home both at the farm and in the urban jungle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Isuzu D-Max X-Terrain was so well received that Isuzu Malaysia even sponsored the ultra-chic 2022 KL Fashion Week in a bid to position the D-Max X-Terrain as the pick-up truck of choice for those who wanted something that bridged both worlds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And for 2023, Isuzu is taking it further by introducing updated D-Max models including a new X-Terrain, one that will appeal to those who wanted just a little bit more from an already very capable pick-up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The exterior of the new X-Terrain is further distinguished by a new darkened front grille that also features fang like appendices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new X-Terrain also offers a new wireless charge pad with a 15W output that makes it great for a quick juice up while on the go
            </p>

                The defective machines not only resulted in a loss of RM13.07 million of public funds but could have contributed directly to possible loss of lives, Yi suggested
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Such life-saving equipment was so vital during the Covid-19 pandemic, and such negligence not only caused wastage of public funds, but more importantly may have compromised the quality care of patients which may have even caused loss of precious lives,” the DAP leader said in a statement

            <p>
                Pharmaniaga Logistics was chosen to buy 500 ventilators during the crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic but the company only managed to supply 136 ventilators, of which only 28 were usable and the remaining 108 ventilators were found to be unsafe for use, according to the audit report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The audit also found that the federal government could not recoup the losses “because there were no documents on the appointment of the procurement of ventilators between the company and MOH, Yii noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No agreement was signed with Pharmaniaga Logistics because the procurement of ventilators was done under “emergency procurement protocols”, it added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The procurement was done during the Muhyiddin administration, whose leaders now face allegations of misappropriating public funds meant for the government’s pandemic management

                The Auditor-General’s 2021 Report found Pharmaniaga Logistics supplied 93 defective ventilators to MOH during the pandemic, costing the government RM13 million in losses that couldn’t be claimed because there were no documents on the procurement done via CSR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On that day, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) approved emergency procurement for the ventilators, enabling the MOH to make advance payment of RM30 million to Pharmaniaga Logistics – identified in the Auditor-General’s report with its company registration number (260790-T) – for the procurement of 500 ventilators costing an estimated RM50 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An additional RM3.97 million approved for Pharmaniaga Logistics to upgrade certain ventilators pushed the cost of the overall procurement of 136 ventilators to RM24.07 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The national audit found that – based on a report by a Covid-19 Pandemic Emergency Procurement Monitoring and Administration Committee meeting on May 23, 2022 – only 28 of the 136 ventilators supplied by Pharmaniaga Logistics to MOH facilities were usable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The national audit found that Pharmaniaga Logistics returned RM6.97 million of the RM30 million advance payment for the ventilators to MOH on June 18, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because there were no documents on the appointment of Company 260790-T by the MOH.” MOH told the national audit in a response last October 7 that no agreement was signed with Pharmaniaga Logistics because the procurement of ventilators was done under emergency procurement protocols

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 16 — Luxembourg court bailiffs issued fresh seizure orders for two units of Malaysian state oil firm Petronas this week, following a bid by descendants of a former sultanate to enforce a US$15-billion (RM66-billion) award they had won against Malaysia, according to the heirs’ lawyer and court documents seen by Reuters

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 16 — Luxembourg court bailiffs issued fresh seizure orders for two units of Malaysian state oil firm Petronas this week, following a bid by descendants of a former sultanate to enforce a US$15-billion (RM66-billion) award they had won against Malaysia, according to the heirs’ lawyer and court documents seen by Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Petronas Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz) and Petronas South Caucasus units were first seized in July 2022, but the Malaysian government said last month that the order had been set aside by a Luxembourg district court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday, Luxembourg court bailiffs issued a second seizure order on the units and related bank accounts, court documents shared by the heirs’ lawyer, Paul Cohen, showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cohen, of British law firm 4-5 Gray’s Inn Square, told Reuters the Luxembourg district court had indeed lifted the first seizure order on a minor issue that has since been addressed, but had not made a judgment on the merits of the arbitration

                Ng, who chairs the Selangor water resource management special select committee, said legal discrepancies related to water pollution offences should also be given attention to avoid conflicting agency jurisdictions, especially in terms of the investigation that was currently happening in the field

                New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said the police held "grave concerns" for those still missing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hipkins said over 100,000 households were still without power on the North Island, home to more than three-quarters of the country's 5 million residents

                On Thursday, the east-coast city of Napier was briefly cut off after experts detected damage to the last useable bridge linking its 65,000 residents with the rest of the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I think the figure will be in the range of several billion - 5 to 10 billion dollars (US$3 to 6 billion), possibly more."

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 16 ― PropertyGuru Malaysia’s Sale Demand Index dropped 14.8 per cent in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2022, reflecting how potential buyers may still be facing affordability issues or a lack of confidence towards the current property prices on the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report showed an uptrend in PropertyGuru Malaysia’s Sale Price Index by 1.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) following the increased Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 2.75 per cent last year, contributing towards the higher overall cost of property ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the whole of 2022, the asking prices listed on PropertyGuru.com.my went up by 5.0 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the report also found that following rising property prices, potential homebuyers gravitated towards the rental market, seeing that the Rental Demand Index increased 32.9 per cent in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The supply of rental listings on PropertyGuru’s website increased by 19.6 per cent, as landlords were jumping back into a rental market with positive demand, seeking alternative income sources to offset inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Fernandez said as the Malaysian economy is expected to expand by 4.0 to 5.0 per cent in 2023, the property market is likely to remain active with positive growth

                You would also have had to spend RM1,023 on petrol for these peak hour trips on your vehicle last year, with about one-fifth or RM221 due to traffic jams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In other words, because of traffic jams, Kuala Lumpur drivers would have spent an extra nine minutes more driving per 10km trip during the morning rush hour, and 12 minutes more during the evening rush hour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TomTom's calculations are based on the assumption of Kuala Lumpur drivers making a 10 km trip during the busiest hour in the morning and cover the same distance during the busiest hour in the evening, and totalled up over an assumed 230 working days per year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On weekdays, the busiest hour for driving in Kuala Lumpur's city centre in the morning would be the 8am to 9am slot (ranging from 18 minutes to 21 minutes), and the 6pm to 7pm slot in the evening (ranging from over 22 minutes to over 25 minutes)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TomTom's data showed that the worst rush hour in the week in Kuala Lumpur would typically fall on Thursdays during the 6pm to 7pm slot, where it would take 25 minutes 20 seconds on average to drive 10km in the city centre area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In comparison to Kuala Lumpur drivers spending 159 hours on the road in peak hours in the city centre last year, Singapore drivers would have spent slightly less time at 150 hours

                The company, which is set to list on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia on March 10, 2023, said the public issue will entail 173 million new shares at 90 sen per share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Post-IPO, Cape EMS is expected to have a market capitalisation of about RM830.7mil based on the enlarged share capital of 923 million shares and retail price of 90 sen per share

                "That is why the government has no plans to allow any more EPF withdrawals in the near future," said Ahmad at a press conference in Parliament on Thursday (Feb 16)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The figure consists of RM20.8bil by 5.3 million members under the i-Lestari programme, RM58.7bil by 6.6 million members under i-Sinar, RM21.4bil by 5.2 million members under i-Citra and RM44.6bil by 6.6 million members during an EPF special withdrawal programme last year

                Ahmad said the median savings in EPF accounts for all Malaysians stood at RM8,100 as of last year, which was a decrease of 50 percent from RM16,600 in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some 6.7 million members or 51.5 percent of 13.1 million EPF members, have savings of less than RM10,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2020, there were 4.7 million members with less than RM10,000 savings

                In a statement on Wednesday (Feb 15), the international rating agency said Malaysia's ratings balance a diversified economy with strong medium-term growth prospects against high public debt, a low revenue base relative to the operating expenditures, and political uncertainty that hinders long-term policymaking

                Fitch said it expects the general government debt-to-GDP ratio to decline from 2024, on strong GDP growth amid gradual consolidation

                About Us Advertise BARCELONA, Feb 16 — Erik ten Hag said Manchester United and Barcelona both needed a “reset” after years of disappointment on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcelona beat Manchester United in the 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals and their most recent tie was in 2019 at the quarter-final stage of that competition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Catalans last won a major European trophy in 2015 when they won the Champions League, while Manchester United’s last silverware came in 2017, winning the Europa League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Both clubs are in the Europa League, (but) both clubs have the ambition to be in the Champions League,” said Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It’s great to face Barcelona,” continued Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag said his former Ajax charge was a player which any club would like to have

                Real Madrid officials recently met with the representatives of Liverpool target and Borussia Dortmund star Jude Bellingham to discuss a summer move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A while back, Liverpool and Madrid were touted as the frontrunners in the race
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it recently emerged that the Spanish giants came to believe that Bellingham prefers a move to the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, Liverpool sit ninth in the Premier League – severely out of form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will be a good opportunity for Bellingham to watch on and make an assessment on both of his options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With this in mind, Liverpool need to step up their negotiations if they are to land the ‘sensational’ star from Dortmund.

                Real Madrid officials recently met with the representatives of Liverpool target and Borussia Dortmund star Jude Bellingham to discuss a summer move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A while back, Liverpool and Madrid were touted as the frontrunners in the race
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it recently emerged that the Spanish giants came to believe that Bellingham prefers a move to the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, Liverpool sit ninth in the Premier League – severely out of form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will be a good opportunity for Bellingham to watch on and make an assessment on both of his options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With this in mind, Liverpool need to step up their negotiations if they are to land the ‘sensational’ star from Dortmund.

                at Breaking News | Business | News  DAIRY products provider Farm Fresh Bhd plans to acquire a 65% stake in the local ice cream chain The Inside Scoop for RM83.9 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FFB said the proposals will pave the way for the group’s entry and ownership in one of the fastest growing artisanal ice creameries and the largest home-grown ice-cream chain in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between the financial years 2017 to 2021, the filing said TISSB group’s revenue grew from RM10 million to RM36.3 million, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Post completion of the proposals, FFB said Edmund Tan and Lim will drive TISSB’s existing ice cream business, which will form part of the FFB Group’s ice cream division
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FFB said the group’s diversification into the artisan ice cream chain business would serve as an opportunity to mitigate its concentration risk on its core business of rearing dairy cows and the production and marketing and sale of dairy milk products

                Arsenal had come from a goal down and looked capable of ending a 10-game losing streak in the league against City but they ultimately came up short as their hopes of a first league title since 2004 suffered a setback
            </p>
            
            <p>
                City had a penalty overturned by VAR but kept probing and took the lead when Grealish fired in his third league goal of the season in the 72nd minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Haaland then netted his 26th league goal of the campaign to silence the home crowd and put Pep Guardiola's side on 51 points, the same as Arsenal but with a superior goal difference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                City almost regained the lead in first-half stoppage time when Ruben Dias's header was flicked on to the crossbar by Ake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nketiah was inches away from giving Arsenal the lead when he slid in to try to connect with a low cross but City began to dominate as Arsenal faded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This time there was no response from Arsenal and Haaland, who was an injury doubt ahead of the game, sealed victory with a typically ruthless finish eight minutes from time

                Arsenal had come from a goal down and looked capable of ending a 10-game losing streak in the league against City but they ultimately came up short as their hopes of a first league title since 2004 suffered a setback
            </p>
            
            <p>
                City had a penalty overturned by VAR but kept probing and took the lead when Grealish fired in his third league goal of the season in the 72nd minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Haaland then netted his 26th league goal of the campaign to silence the home crowd and put Pep Guardiola's side on 51 points, the same as Arsenal but with a superior goal difference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                City almost regained the lead in first-half stoppage time when Ruben Dias's header was flicked on to the crossbar by Ake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nketiah was inches away from giving Arsenal the lead when he slid in to try to connect with a low cross but City began to dominate as Arsenal faded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This time there was no response from Arsenal and Haaland, who was an injury doubt ahead of the game, sealed victory with a typically ruthless finish eight minutes from time
            </p>

                Sara Khadem of Iran sits in front of a chess board
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But 25-year-old Sarasadat Khademalsharieh, better known as Sara Khadem, also told Reuters that the warrant, which made her return to Iran impossible, was "the most horrible thing" that happened to her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said that, after playing in December's FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in Kazakhstan's Almaty without the headscarf mandatory under Iran's strict Islamic dress code, she had hardly expected harsher reprisals than a travel ban
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "But it (no hijab) has become one of the symbols of the movement in Iran and I also decided to finally do something that I wanted to, to be myself...I was motivated by the people of Iran." Laws enforcing mandatory hijab-wearing have become a flashpoint during the unrest that has swept Iran since mid-September when a 22-year-old Iranian-Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, died in the custody of the morality police
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There are lots of things that people are not happy about at the moment, so even if this time it doesn't change anything, I think there will come a time when people will rise up again," said Khadem, who does not consider herself a political activist, but wants to be a voice for change
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ranked 774th in the world and 9th in Iran, Khadem plans to keep playing under the Iranian flag, but has received proposals from other countries

                Sara Khadem of Iran sits in front of a chess board
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But 25-year-old Sarasadat Khademalsharieh, better known as Sara Khadem, also told Reuters that the warrant, which made her return to Iran impossible, was "the most horrible thing" that happened to her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said that, after playing in December's FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in Kazakhstan's Almaty without the headscarf mandatory under Iran's strict Islamic dress code, she had hardly expected harsher reprisals than a travel ban
            </p>

                "But it (no hijab) has become one of the symbols of the movement in Iran and I also decided to finally do something that I wanted to, to be myself...I was motivated by the people of Iran." Laws enforcing mandatory hijab-wearing have become a flashpoint during the unrest that has swept Iran since mid-September when a 22-year-old Iranian-Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, died in the custody of the morality police
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There are lots of things that people are not happy about at the moment, so even if this time it doesn't change anything, I think there will come a time when people will rise up again," said Khadem, who does not consider herself a political activist, but wants to be a voice for change
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ranked 774th in the world and 9th in Iran, Khadem plans to keep playing under the Iranian flag, but has received proposals from other countries

                Sentiment has been improving, buoyed by Beijing's COVID-19 policy U-turn in December and supportive measures, but the recovery has been patchy, with private surveys showing home sales by floor area slumping around 20 per cent from a year earlier

                A CAAC official said air transportation recovered rapidly in January, with strong demand between cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and the popular holiday destination of Sanya on Hainan Island during the Chinese New Year period.

                The Mercedes-Maybach S580e’s hybrid system pairs a 3.0 litre inline-six engine making 367 hp and 500 Nm of torque to a 150 hp, 440 Nm electric motor sandwiched between the engine and the 9G-Tronic gearbox
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, the sole Mercedes-Maybach S-Class with a published pricelist in Malaysia is the S580 (with no e), with a 1.9 million ringgit pricetag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s got a mild 48V hybrid 20 PS, 200 Nm motor, but hybrid assist capabilities are far from what the plug-in hybrid is capable of
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The range topper is the Mercedes-Maybach S680, which doesn’t have an official pricelist, but we are sure if your pockets are deep enough you can order one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No 48V hybrid system here – powering the S680 is purely a 6.0 litre V12 engine making 621 hp and 1000 Nm of torque
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Want to go greener than this Maybach S580e? You’ll have to wait for the production version of the Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV for that

                The Mercedes-Maybach S580e’s hybrid system pairs a 3.0 litre inline-six engine making 367 hp and 500 Nm of torque to a 150 hp, 440 Nm electric motor sandwiched between the engine and the 9G-Tronic gearbox
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, the sole Mercedes-Maybach S-Class with a published pricelist in Malaysia is the S580 (with no e), with a 1.9 million ringgit pricetag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s got a mild 48V hybrid 20 PS, 200 Nm motor, but hybrid assist capabilities are far from what the plug-in hybrid is capable of
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The range topper is the Mercedes-Maybach S680, which doesn’t have an official pricelist, but we are sure if your pockets are deep enough you can order one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No 48V hybrid system here – powering the S680 is purely a 6.0 litre V12 engine making 621 hp and 1000 Nm of torque
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Want to go greener than this Maybach S580e? You’ll have to wait for the production version of the Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV for that

                In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, FFB said the acquisition represented 53.0 per cent of the enlarged issued shares in TISSB after the completion of the proposals, for a total purchase consideration of about RM68.4 million, subject to adjustments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FFB has also entered into share subscription agreement (SSA) with TISSB for the proposed subscription of 104,771 new TISSB shares, representing 12 per cent of the enlarged issued shares in TISSB for a total subscription consideration of about RM15.5 million based on the terms and conditions of the agreement
