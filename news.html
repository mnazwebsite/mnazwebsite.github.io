                Justice Sequerah said one of the bail conditions was for the accused to surrender his passport to the court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Sequerah said the court, however, took cognisance of the fact that Ahmad Zahid, as a Deputy Prime Minister and the Rural and Regional Development Minister, has official duties to perform
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court allowed Ahmad Zahid to have temporary access to his passport for the purpose of applying for a diplomatic passport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following this, Ahmad Zahid would have to return his passport to the court

            <p>
                On Jan 20, Ahmad Zahid filed the application for the permanent release of his passport, which he said was done bona fide (with good intentions) so that he could perform his official duties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid stated that he needed the passport returned because he was required to travel outside of the country as part of his duties, and that it would also assist him in applying for a diplomatic passport for official travel

                "The first meeting of the Fiscal Policy Committee this year emphasises that the government will take a responsible approach in drafting Budget 2023 which will prioritise prudent drivers of economic growth and equitable development based on social justice for Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, who is also the Finance Minister, said for 2022, the government's debts and liabilities were almost at RM1.5 trillion or over 80% of the country's GDP with a debt service ratio that is expected to be over 15% of revenue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Global growth is also expected to be moderate for 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Budget 2023, said Anwar, would reflect the unity government's responsibility in prioritising growth, equitable distribution and social justice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The budget, he added, would also increase development spending to encourage inclusive development, especially in the strengthening of government services and rural infrastructure

                About Us Advertise JOHOR BARU, Feb 3 ― Johor’s Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar today said the new fatwa against Muslim participation in the other faiths’ rituals would not alter the racial and religious diversity espoused in the “Bangsa Johor” concept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that the fatwa the Johor Islamic Religious Council issued yesterday did not conflict with the state’s inter-faith values of tolerance, unity and understanding, adding that Johor would always respect multiracialism and religious diversity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The fatwa only prohibits Muslims from taking part in other religious rituals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is a guideline for them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was commenting on to the fatwa that some saw as restricting Johor’s progressive values as it did not differentiate between religious acts, cultural events and folklore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this is based on Sultan Ibrahim’s consent to the fatwa

                About Us Advertise JOHOR BARU, Feb 3 ― Johor’s Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar today said the new fatwa against Muslim participation in the other faiths’ rituals would not alter the racial and religious diversity espoused in the “Bangsa Johor” concept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that the fatwa the Johor Islamic Religious Council issued yesterday did not conflict with the state’s inter-faith values of tolerance, unity and understanding, adding that Johor would always respect multiracialism and religious diversity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The fatwa only prohibits Muslims from taking part in other religious rituals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is a guideline for them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was commenting on to the fatwa that some saw as restricting Johor’s progressive values as it did not differentiate between religious acts, cultural events and folklore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this is based on Sultan Ibrahim’s consent to the fatwa

                In those BBM messages in December 2014, she explained to Low that this was because Cheah Tek Kuang was leaving AmBank’s board by the end of the month and the bank would not have any direct access to the account holder Najib, and that Cheah’s replacement Ashok Ramamurthy would be updating Bank Negara Malaysia, AmBank’s chief risk officer and AmBank’s board about Najib’s accounts

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 3 — Following an expected growth of 7.8 per cent in 2022, Malaysia’s economy is projected to grow at a “moderate pace” of 4.0 per cent this year, according to the World Bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its “Malaysia Economic Monitor February 2023” report released today, the World Bank attributed the lower growth rate partly to a troubled global economy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The World Bank previously announced that global economic growth is forecasted to decelerate sharply to 1.7 per cent in 2023, compared to a 2022 global growth rate of 2.8 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report also said that in line with a less supportive global environment, Malaysia’s trade growth is expected to slow down to 2.2 per cent in 2023, while import growth is projected to drop to 2.1 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, it said that government revenue is projected to decrease to 15 per cent of GDP this year — compared to the expected 16.7 per cent in 2022 — as crude oil prices come down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The main factor that is expected to drive Malaysia’s economic growth this year is domestic private spending

                That'd be a mighty huge coincidence to randomly interview two students in the same school named after two heroes of the same saga, and bearing two-word Chinese names, which is a rarity in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, I don't doubt the headline, but people familiar with Chinese literature and Chinese history will be quick to notice the oddity of the two students interviewed and question the motives of the article

                She testified that Low had offered the phone to her, but she declined with the excuse that she did not want or need a phone

                Berkshire Hathaway — and every other major name in finance — is somewhat limited in what it can do
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And even if the company chose to do so, and uncovered a 10 times opportunity, the upside would be barely noticeable to Berkshire Hathaway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With revenue of $2.8 million in 2021, Sensate is the kind of company Buffett and other major financial names can’t claim a meaningful stake in, but for a limited time, everyday investors can invest here

                MAN UTD'S 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest on Wednesday evening was their 12th home victory in a row in all competitions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is a run that has seen Erik ten Hag's men move into the top four in the Premier League table, reach the fifth round of the FA Cup and the final of the Carabao Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The last time Man Utd won 12 or more home matches on the spin during a single season was a run of form from December 2010 to May 2011
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Their home games after the weekend then come against Leeds, Leicester and Barcelona

                Emilia Hanafi, 43, said that she chose to work part-time because she had to manage the schooling of her three sons, aged 17, 12 and 10, including dropping them off and fetching them from school
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seventh prosecution witness told the court that she took up a part-time job to support the family, including her three sons, for whom the interim maintenance of RM2,000 received for each child was insufficient
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Emilia testified on Thursday, after the court allowed the application of lawyer, Datuk Akberdin Abdul Kader, who represented SM Faisal, for Emilia to be called to testify despite objection from the prosecution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DPP Zahida Zakaria, however, informed the court that she would file a revision application against the court's order for Emilia to testify on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thursday’s hearing was supposed to proceed with the sixth prosecution witness, Elisa Nani, who is Emilia's younger sister, to be cross-examined by the lawyer, but Akberdin applied for Emilia be called to testify first, because she is an important witness for the prosecution

                Joanna Yu, who is the 41st prosecution witness in the RM2.28bil 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) graft trial involving Najib, has consistently told the High Court that she dealt with Low, or better known as Jho Low, to get instructions on Najib's accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low's denial was brought up by Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah here at the High Court on Thursday (Feb 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defence has previously contended that Low was the "mastermind" behind the 1MDB scandal while Yu testified before that she would receive instructions from Low on managing Najib's bank account whenever she could not get hold of Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, who is the mandate holder to Najib's bank accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness said she was unsure how the questions were posed to Low by the MACC

            <p>
                The witness also said she had rejected job offers from Low several times because she did not want to work according to Low's lifestyle

                In the statement of claim, Mohd Hatta said Dr Mahathir, who was then the seventh prime minister, had committed tort misfeasance in public office when he decided to postpone the HSR project, causing the government and the Malaysian people to pay compensation of almost RM46 million to the Singapore government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that Muhyiddin, who was then the eighth prime minister, also committed tort misfeasance in public office for terminating the project, causing the Malaysian government and the people to pay RM320,270,519.24 as compensation for the cancellation of the Bilateral Agreement between Malaysia and Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Hatta claimed that Mustapha, who was responsible for managing the project, had committed a similar offence by shelving the project, while Wee committed tort misfeasance in public office for denying the Malaysians their right to enjoy a first-class transport system with the cancellation of the HSR project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is seeking a court order to declare the cancellation of the project null and void, as well as for all the defendants to pay RM1 million compensation to him and all Malaysians for wrongfully and negligently cancelling the HSR project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 1, 2021, Malaysia and Singapore announced the termination of the 350-kilometre HSR project as the two countries failed to reach an agreement on changes proposed by Malaysia before the expiry of the project agreement on December 31, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Accordingly, Malaysia paid S$102.8 million (RM320.27 million) to Singapore for costs incurred for the development of the HSR project

                Describing it as another significant victory for Malaysia against the self-claimed heirs, Azalina said the Spanish Court's annulment of Stampa’s appointment as arbitrator is final and reaffirms Malaysia’s position on the arbitration case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On June 29, 2021, the High Court of Justice of Madrid (HCJM) issued a decision that annulled the judicial appointment of Stampa to act as an arbitrator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stampa was initially appointed arbitrator in 2019 by the HCJM without Malaysia being involved in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The self-claimed Sulu claimants recognised that Stampa was not an arbitrator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This constitutional appeal did not say the effects of the annulment decision and as such, his Stampa's termination was already final and binding since a court decision on June 29, 2021, Azalina said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azalina said that the Spanish Constitutional Court had rejected the constitutional appeal filed by the Sulu claimants because they had withdrawn their claim to appoint an arbitrator following the annulment decision

            </p>
            
            <p>
                This included funnelling money from offshore accounts controlled by Adani’s brother Vinod Adani into listed units to inflate their share prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The timing of the allegations was also terrible, coming just as Adani was seeking to raise $2.5 billion to strengthen its finances with a share sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - How has Adani reacted? - On January 25, Adani’s finance chief called the Hindenburg report a “malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hindenburg said Adani’s statement failed to answer most of the questions raised in its report

                Fred's goal with 14 minutes to play came just three minutes after United had opened the scoring through Anthony Martial who had recently come off the bench as United strolled to an overall 5-0 aggregate win in the semi-final clash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pair's careers did briefly overlap with the Portugal team between 2017 and 2018.  Bruno Fernandes (left) played a skillful assist to set up Fred (with Marcus Rashford, far right) for Manchester United's second goal in their 2-0 Carabao Cup victory over Nottingham Forest Fernandes (right) celebrates a Portugal goal with Ricardo Quaresma (second left) in 2018 Quaresma had a short spell on loan at Chelsea in 2009 but only played five times Quaresma had a good friendship with Cristiano Ronaldo as together they won Euro 2016 'I learned from Quaresma so I had a great professor in Portugal so you have to learn with the players
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We won and we are into the final so we are very happy with that.' Fernandes put in a commanding central performance in midfield to seal a place in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley later this month where the Red Devils will take on Newcastle United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It represents a first chance for the Portugal star to win his first trophy with United, who are on a trophy drought stretching back to 2017 when they lifted the Europa League under Jose Mourinho
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For me it’s been three years in the cup, we reached one final and didn’t win that one unfortunately

                Fred's goal with 14 minutes to play came just three minutes after United had opened the scoring through Anthony Martial who had recently come off the bench as United strolled to an overall 5-0 aggregate win in the semi-final clash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pair's careers did briefly overlap with the Portugal team between 2017 and 2018.  Bruno Fernandes (left) played a skillful assist to set up Fred (with Marcus Rashford, far right) for Manchester United's second goal in their 2-0 Carabao Cup victory over Nottingham Forest Fernandes (right) celebrates a Portugal goal with Ricardo Quaresma (second left) in 2018 Quaresma had a short spell on loan at Chelsea in 2009 but only played five times Quaresma had a good friendship with Cristiano Ronaldo as together they won Euro 2016 'I learned from Quaresma so I had a great professor in Portugal so you have to learn with the players
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We won and we are into the final so we are very happy with that.' Fernandes put in a commanding central performance in midfield to seal a place in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley later this month where the Red Devils will take on Newcastle United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It represents a first chance for the Portugal star to win his first trophy with United, who are on a trophy drought stretching back to 2017 when they lifted the Europa League under Jose Mourinho
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For me it’s been three years in the cup, we reached one final and didn’t win that one unfortunately

                Ibrahima Konaté's injury is a reminder that Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp has been denied a key luxury enjoyed by Arsenal and Newcastle so far this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even when you apply criteria as broad as this, there are only two Premier League matches this season where you could genuinely make the case that Klopp has been able to field his best team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was the first game of the season against Fulham, when Matip started alongside Van Dijk, Henderson captained the side and Firmino and Díaz joined Salah in the forward line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On one level, this offers us mitigation for Liverpool's collapse this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unlike Arsenal and Newcastle, Liverpool hasn't been able to reap the benefits of a settled side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even if it had enjoyed the same luxuries as Newcastle, Liverpool might have still have been outside the top four

                Ibrahima Konaté's injury is a reminder that Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp has been denied a key luxury enjoyed by Arsenal and Newcastle so far this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even when you apply criteria as broad as this, there are only two Premier League matches this season where you could genuinely make the case that Klopp has been able to field his best team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was the first game of the season against Fulham, when Matip started alongside Van Dijk, Henderson captained the side and Firmino and Díaz joined Salah in the forward line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On one level, this offers us mitigation for Liverpool's collapse this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unlike Arsenal and Newcastle, Liverpool hasn't been able to reap the benefits of a settled side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even if it had enjoyed the same luxuries as Newcastle, Liverpool might have still have been outside the top four

                'No one believed he was one of ours.' Enzo Fernandez joined Chelsea in a British record £107million transfer from Benfica Fernandez is the latest star arrival at Chelsea following a January of heavy spending by the club Even during his boyhood years in his home nation of Argentina Fernandez was in-demand There is a River Plate shirt signed by Fernandez proudly displayed on the club wall
            </p>

            <p>
                Fernandez (red) has the ability to become Chelsea's newest midfield leader after joining from Benfica Fernandez won the World Cup with Argentina alongside national hero Lionel Messi in Qatar 'Make sure you shoot, you'll score,' Pablo Esquivel, who had discovered five-year-old Enzo at La Recova, told him in a text message on the eve of that Mexico game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Messi who played him in and Fernandez's goal made him the youngest player (21 years and 313 days) since Messi (18 years and 257 days) to score in a World Cup group game for his country

            <p>
                By then Fernandez will be a year into life in west London and Chelsea will know if, as it was for La Recova, it is always worth doing whatever it takes to have him on your side.

                Working with a financial advisor can potentially help you maximize your savings and extend how long your money will last in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Determining How Much You Have You may think that you have $1.5 million for retirement, but a closer inspection of your assets and income streams may make you realize you have more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taking a thorough inventory can help you determine not only how long $1.5 million will last, but how much you can reasonably spend each year.  Retirement Assets  In addition to your $1.5 million, you may have other assets that can be used to supplement your income at a later date or will be included in your estate for your heirs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, cash doesn't lose money, right? Wrong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Time is every investor's friend.  Here's how fast you would run out of money with each portfolio type, assuming you have a $1.5 million portfolio and withdrew $60,000 annually, taking out 3.8% more every year for inflation, which is the historical average annual inflation rate since 1960.  Cash Portfolio Withdrawing $60,000 annually from a $1.5 million portfolio kept in cash would cause you to run out of money in 18 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Working with a financial advisor can help you determine the right way to invest your portfolio for long-term stability.  The Bottom Line How long $1.5 million will last in retirement depends foremost on how quickly you spend money

                Working with a financial advisor can potentially help you maximize your savings and extend how long your money will last in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Determining How Much You Have You may think that you have $1.5 million for retirement, but a closer inspection of your assets and income streams may make you realize you have more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taking a thorough inventory can help you determine not only how long $1.5 million will last, but how much you can reasonably spend each year.  Retirement Assets  In addition to your $1.5 million, you may have other assets that can be used to supplement your income at a later date or will be included in your estate for your heirs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, cash doesn't lose money, right? Wrong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Time is every investor's friend.  Here's how fast you would run out of money with each portfolio type, assuming you have a $1.5 million portfolio and withdrew $60,000 annually, taking out 3.8% more every year for inflation, which is the historical average annual inflation rate since 1960.  Cash Portfolio Withdrawing $60,000 annually from a $1.5 million portfolio kept in cash would cause you to run out of money in 18 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Working with a financial advisor can help you determine the right way to invest your portfolio for long-term stability.  The Bottom Line How long $1.5 million will last in retirement depends foremost on how quickly you spend money

                In a statement, Grab said Foo would oversee the business strategy and operations of Grab’s businesses in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A ten-year veteran at Grab, she was previously the country head in Malaysia between 2012-2014 before moving on to regional roles, most recently the regional head of merchants & regional head of GrabExpress as well as newly appointed chief executive officer of Jaya Grocer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goh will assume the position of regional head of deliveries and mobility
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Foo’s proven credentials and entrepreneurial spirit in scaling and growing Grab across Southeast Asia fits perfectly for this next phase of growth for Grab in Malaysia and I’m so excited to welcome her back to the country leadership team," Cohen said.

                In a statement, Grab said Foo would oversee the business strategy and operations of Grab’s businesses in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A ten-year veteran at Grab, she was previously the country head in Malaysia between 2012-2014 before moving on to regional roles, most recently the regional head of merchants & regional head of GrabExpress as well as newly appointed chief executive officer of Jaya Grocer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goh will assume the position of regional head of deliveries and mobility
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Foo’s proven credentials and entrepreneurial spirit in scaling and growing Grab across Southeast Asia fits perfectly for this next phase of growth for Grab in Malaysia and I’m so excited to welcome her back to the country leadership team," Cohen said.

                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, in a statement, said that it includes suppression in several Israeli occupation prisons as well as collective punishments and reprisals

            <p>
                Anwar said Malaysia also calls upon the international community to hold the Israeli regime to account for these crimes and demands the regime to immediately cease further acts of cruelty and barbarism

                He also said that Malaysia continues to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine, and reaffirms its unwavering support for the Palestinians and their cause to achieve freedom from the illegal Israeli occupation and realise their aspirations for an independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as their capital

                Emilia Hanafi, 43, said that she chose to work part-time because she has to manage the schooling of her three sons, aged 17, 12 and 10, including dropping them off and fetching them from school

                Emilia testified on Thursday after the court allowed the application of lawyer Datuk Akberdin Abdul Kader, who represents SM Faisal, for Emilia to be called to testify despite objection from the prosecution

                Thursday’s hearing was supposed to proceed with the sixth prosecution witness, Elisa Nani, who is Emilia's younger sister, to be cross-examined by the lawyer, but Akberdin applied for Emilia be called to testify first, because she is an important witness for the prosecution

                The court also rejected Hock Peng’s application to strike out the suit filed by the government through the LHDN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 24, 2021, the government as the plaintiff filed an application for a summary judgment to be entered against Hock Peng as the defendant in its suit to recover RM1,884,098,662.55 with interest at 5% per annum from the date of this judgment (Feb 1) to the date of full realisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The application was made on the grounds, among others, that the tax arrears and tax increases imposed under the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1967 can be recovered as a tax due and payable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hock Peng filed an application to strike out the suit on March 22, 2021, saying, among others, that the assessment years 2011 and 2012, as well as the additional assessments for 2013 and 2014, were invalid because they were made more than five years from the year of assessment on the income claimed to have accrued without complying with Section 91(3) of the Income Tax Act 1967
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Oct 18 last year, the Penang High Court allowed LHDN’s application for a summary judgment to recover RM1.05bil in tax arrears from Jho Low

                The court also rejected Hock Peng’s application to strike out the suit filed by the government through the LHDN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 24, 2021, the government as the plaintiff filed an application for a summary judgment to be entered against Hock Peng as the defendant in its suit to recover RM1,884,098,662.55 with interest at 5% per annum from the date of this judgment (Feb 1) to the date of full realisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The application was made on the grounds, among others, that the tax arrears and tax increases imposed under the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1967 can be recovered as a tax due and payable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hock Peng filed an application to strike out the suit on March 22, 2021, saying, among others, that the assessment years 2011 and 2012, as well as the additional assessments for 2013 and 2014, were invalid because they were made more than five years from the year of assessment on the income claimed to have accrued without complying with Section 91(3) of the Income Tax Act 1967
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Oct 18 last year, the Penang High Court allowed LHDN’s application for a summary judgment to recover RM1.05bil in tax arrears from Jho Low

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 2 — The Spanish Constitutional Court has upheld the annulment of Gonzalo Stampa the arbitrator for the group of individuals claiming to be the heirs of the Sultan of Sulu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Spanish Constitutional Court has just rejected the extraordinary constitutional appeal (recurso de amparo) filed by a group of individuals styling themselves as the “heirs” of the Sultan of Sulu (“Claimants”) against the annulment of Mr Stampa’s appointment as arbitrator in the so-called Sulu dispute

                ISD said on Wednesday (Feb 1) that Irfan is believed to have acted alone and had not radicalised others

            <p>
                That is why he was arrested.” On his plan to attack the Amoy Quee Camp, where the NCC headquarters is located, ISD said he had been inspired by ISIS car-bomb videos and wanted to recruit a suicide bomber who would bomb the gate of the camp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the time of his arrest, Irfan’s attack plans against Amoy Quee Camp and Keramat Habib Noh had not progressed beyond the ideation stage, said ISD

            <p>
                In March 2021, it was reported that a 20-year-old full-time national serviceman who planned to use a knife to attack and kill Jews here, and to take up arms abroad, had been detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA)

                Arsenal moved on January transfer deadline day to snap up Jorginho from Chelsea for £12million - but the Italian was not the only midfielder on the Gunners' radar  Arsenal explored the possibility of signing two eye-catching midfielders who ply their trade on the continent before wrapping up a deal for Jorginho, according to reports

            <p>
                Jorginho was the player welcomed to London Colney training ground on Tuesday, but he was far from the only player on the club's radar as the window wound down

                Shelvey, 30, was the next man to be confirmed by the club as he swapped Newcastle for Nottingham - signing a contract until 2025
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "You can see it’s a club looking to really grow

            <p>
                "I previously knew of him from my time at Liverpool, so I knew what a fantastic coach he was, but meeting him for the first time has been a breath of fresh air

            <p>

                NOTTINGHAM FOREST have confirmed THREE deadline day signings in Felipe, Jonjo Shelvey and Keylor Navas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Tricky Trees brought in a remarkable 23 new players during the summer window ahead of their first season back in the Premier League for more than two decades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shelvey, 30, was the next man to be confirmed by the club as he swapped Newcastle for Nottingham - signing a contract until 2025
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "You can see it’s a club looking to really grow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I previously knew of him from my time at Liverpool, so I knew what a fantastic coach he was, but meeting him for the first time has been a breath of fresh air
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He’s told me what he expects and the high standards he sets, so I can hope I can come and help the team push to stay in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Forest's most decorated deadline day signing was undoubtedly keeper Navas

                Members of the Incident Management Team coordinate the search for a radioactive capsule that was lost in transit by a contractor hired by Rio Tinto, at the Emergency Services Complex in Cockburn, Australia, in this undated handout photo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Caesium-137 capsule lost in transit more than two weeks ago was discovered when a vehicle travelling at 70 kms per hour equipped with specialist detection equipment picked up the radiation, according to officials from the state of Western Australia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The search team then used portable detection equipment to find the capsule, which was located about 2 metres from the side of the road in a remote area far from any community, they added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The radioactive capsule was part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed from Rio Tinto's  Gudai-Darri mine in the state's remote Kimberley region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                People had been told to stay at least five metres (16.5 feet) away if they spotted the capsule, because exposure could cause radiation burns or radiation sickness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Western Australia's Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said the find was an "extraordinary result" after a search involving the state's emergency response department, defence authorities and radiation specialists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Western Australia's Chief Health Officer Andrew Robertson said there would be an investigation and prosecutions would be considered under state radiation safety laws from 1975

                There are three vice-president positions in the United Malays National Organisation that are up for grabs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are three spots up for grabs.  The top two posts in UMNO – that of the president and deputy president – will not be contested after its General Assembly passed a motion in January to leave those posts unchallenged at the upcoming internal election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is the party president while Mr Mohamad Hasan is the deputy president.  According to a report by the New Straits Times (NST) on Wednesday (Feb 1), at least seven candidates will be contesting for the three vice-president spots.  They include the party’s Supreme Council members Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir, Ms Azalina Othman Said as well as Mr Johari Abdul Ghani
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Zambry is the current foreign affairs minister while Ms Azalina is the current minister of law and institutional reform.  Others who are believed to be interested in the vice-president posts are incumbent Mr Mohamed Khaled Nordin, UMNO youth chief Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki, former Johor chief minister Hasni Mohammad and Sabah UMNO leader Bung Moktar Radin.  The report by NST added that the other two vice-president incumbents - former prime minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Mr Mahdzir Khalid - have not expressed intentions to defend their posts.  Party insiders told NST that incumbent Mr Khaled is likely to retain his post.  “Khaled is expected to defend his post successfully, given his good ties with party leaders and supporters,” the source reportedly said.  NST also reported that the three candidates who have positioned themselves in the “pro-president” camp - Dr Zambry, Ms Azalina and Mr Asyraf - are strong contenders for the three vice-president spots.  “Zambry, Azalina and Asyraf are the only known pro-president candidates in the party,” the source reportedly told NST, adding that Mr Johari is a “wildcard” in the battle to be one of UMNO’s three vice-presidents.  “Johari is close to the party president
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He has told his supporters that change (for the better) will happen in UMNO and he is preparing for it," the source was quoted as saying by NST.  The NST report also said that a party insider it interviewed denied rumours that former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin and former defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein had planned to contest the vice-president posts.  “That is not true
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This comes after UMNO president Ahmad Zahid previously warned that the party would undergo “mass cleansing” to get rid of “saboteurs”.  Separately, international trade and industry minister Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz also announced his intention for a spot on the UMNO Supreme Council at the upcoming party elections.  "I humbly offer myself to contest for a seat in the UMNO Supreme Council with the hopes that I (can) contribute further to the development of the party," he told local broadcaster Astro Awani.  Mr Zafrul added that UMNO members want to see a more dynamic group leading the party

                A woman holds a sign as people take part in a right to strike protest outside Downing Street in London, Britain, Jan 30, 2023

                "Instead of scheming up new ways to attack the right to strike, ministers should get pay rising across the economy – starting with a decent pay rise for workers across the public sector." The government says "mitigations" will be in place but the strikes would have a significant impact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Wednesday, about 300,000 teachers will take action, along with 100,000 civil servants from more than 120 government departments, and tens of thousands of university lecturers and rail workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An Ipsos poll released on Wednesday suggested the public was divided on the multiple strike action, with 40 per cent supporting the action and 38 per cent opposed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sunak's government has so far taken a hard line with public sector strikes, saying that to give in to demands for large wage increases would only fuel inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, with confidence weak among the public and employers and the economy in a downturn, the strikes were adding to a sense of gloom in Britain's economy

The government says "mitigations" will be in place but the strikes would have a significant impact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Wednesday, about 300,000 teachers will take action, along with 100,000 civil servants from more than 120 government departments, and tens of thousands of university lecturers and rail workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An Ipsos poll released on Wednesday suggested the public was divided on the multiple strike action, with 40 per cent supporting the action and 38 per cent opposed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sunak's government has so far taken a hard line with public sector strikes, saying that to give in to demands for large wage increases would only fuel inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, with confidence weak among the public and employers and the economy in a downturn, the strikes were adding to a sense of gloom in Britain's economy

                New home prices rose month-on-month in 12 cities, up from 10 in December, according to the survey by China Index Academy (CIA), one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China's property sector, accounting for a quarter of the economy, has struggled with defaults and stalled projects, hitting market confidence and weighing on economic growth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The survey also showed six cities, notably the Chinese capital Beijing and the populous city of Chengdu in southwest China, reversed declines to post growth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More broadly, prices in 100 cities monitored by the research firm fell 0.02 per cent from a month earlier in January compared with the bigger 0.08 per cent drop in December and marking the fourth straight month of narrowing declines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China's financial and commercial hub Shanghai saw a 0.04 per cent rise in home prices in January from a month earlier, extending the 0.01 per cent rise in December, while the mega-city of Hangzhou, capital of the prosperous coastal province of Zhejiang, reported a 0.11 per cent gain versus 0.06 per cent growth in the previous month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "National property market policies will continue to ease, with some key first- and second-tier cities taking the lead in recovery and driving a gradual stabilisation of the national market," Cao said.

                New home prices rose month-on-month in 12 cities, up from 10 in December, according to the survey by China Index Academy (CIA), one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China's property sector, accounting for a quarter of the economy, has struggled with defaults and stalled projects, hitting market confidence and weighing on economic growth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The survey also showed six cities, notably the Chinese capital Beijing and the populous city of Chengdu in southwest China, reversed declines to post growth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More broadly, prices in 100 cities monitored by the research firm fell 0.02 per cent from a month earlier in January compared with the bigger 0.08 per cent drop in December and marking the fourth straight month of narrowing declines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China's financial and commercial hub Shanghai saw a 0.04 per cent rise in home prices in January from a month earlier, extending the 0.01 per cent rise in December, while the mega-city of Hangzhou, capital of the prosperous coastal province of Zhejiang, reported a 0.11 per cent gain versus 0.06 per cent growth in the previous month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "National property market policies will continue to ease, with some key first- and second-tier cities taking the lead in recovery and driving a gradual stabilisation of the national market," Cao said.

                Julien Laurens explains why Premier League record breaking signing of Enzo Fernandez by Chelsea is a 'game changer'
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A statement from Benfica confirmed that a deal had been reached between the clubs over how Chelsea would pay the release fee for the 22-year-old, who has signed an eight-and-a-half year contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal breaks the previous Premier League record fee of £100m that Manchester City paid for Jack Grealish when he joined from Aston Villa in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Benfica boss Roger Schmidt was not keen on seeing Fernandez leave, but had previously said their hands would be tied if a club paid the player's release clause
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal takes Chelsea's total outlay on players since last year's takeover by an investment group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital to more than £500m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea are 10th in the Premier League, 10 points adrift of a top-four spot

                The deal breaks the previous Premier League record fee of £100m that Manchester City paid for Jack Grealish when he joined from Aston Villa in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Benfica boss Roger Schmidt was not keen on seeing Fernandez leave, but had previously said their hands would be tied if a club paid the player's release clause

                The deal takes Chelsea's total outlay on players since last year's takeover by an investment group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital to more than £500m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea are 10th in the Premier League, 10 points adrift of a top-four spot

            <p>
                Sabitzer will join United on a straight loan until the end of the season, joining Jack Butland and Wout Weghorst on temporary deals at Old Trafford

            <p>
                And Sabitzer was by no means the only player in the area that United looked at recruiting before 11pm

            <p>
                According to reports, United asked about Ryan Gravenberch when enquiring about Sabitzer, but to no avail

                Sabitzer will join United on a straight loan until the end of the season, joining Jack Butland and Wout Weghorst on temporary deals at Old Trafford

                Christian Eriksen has been ruled out for at least three months with an injury sustained in the FA Cup, fixing the spotlight on Fred to step up for Manchester United Erik ten Hag has backed Fred to fill the void left in Manchester United's midfield by Christian Eriksen's enforced absence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fred and Casemiro will form United's midfield for Wednesday's EFL Cup semi-final second leg against Nottingham Forest, with the Red Devils holding a commanding 3-0 lead from the first leg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pair play together for Brazil and Ten Hag said he believes Fred has the quality and personality to step up and ease the blow of losing Eriksen for so long
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He’s playing together with Casemiro in the Brazil squad,” Ten Hag said of Fred

                Christian Eriksen has been ruled out for at least three months with an injury sustained in the FA Cup, fixing the spotlight on Fred to step up for Manchester United Erik ten Hag has backed Fred to fill the void left in Manchester United's midfield by Christian Eriksen's enforced absence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fred and Casemiro will form United's midfield for Wednesday's EFL Cup semi-final second leg against Nottingham Forest, with the Red Devils holding a commanding 3-0 lead from the first leg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pair play together for Brazil and Ten Hag said he believes Fred has the quality and personality to step up and ease the blow of losing Eriksen for so long
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He’s playing together with Casemiro in the Brazil squad,” Ten Hag said of Fred
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Will Manchester United win the EFL Cup this season? Have your say in the comments! United are 90 minutes away from a first final under Ten Hag in his debut season and the Dutchman called for focus, despite his holding a big advantage from the first leg

                THERE might not be any authentic Geordies in the Newcastle team once the Saudi money starts truly gushing into Tyneside.   So this was a night to cherish for the Toon Army, and for local hero Sean Longstaff, as his early double in front of the Gallowgate End propelled the club to its first Wembley final in 24 years.  The big midfielder, Newcastle born and bred, was serenaded with cries of "he’s one of our own" from a home crowd who thought they might be able to enjoy a significant win without much anxiety or tension

            <p>
                Now, in the Carabao Cup Final, they will face Manchester United - barring a miracle from Nottingham Forest in the second leg at Old Trafford - seeking a first major trophy in 54 years and a first Wembley final success in 68 years

                Porsche said it had been in touch with the first person who made an online reservation and “negotiated an agreeable outcome” regarding the one vehicle the dealership had in stock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche contacted all of the other bidders individually to explain the situation and apologise, and will refund reservation fees within 48 hours, the spokeswoman said

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 1 — TikTok star Callum Ryan set himself up for his coolest challenge yet — to fly to Italy and buy a pizza for cheaper than the price of a UK Domino’s
            </p>

                As soon as he was seated, he was served a free glass of prosecco and a piece of what he described as a pizza pesto thing that he concluded was, “Quite nice.” He then ordered a Margherita pizza and also a beer which didn’t count as it was an optional extra

                The pizza on its own was €8.50 and the table service was €2.50, which meant a total of €11, which converted into £9.72 (RM52)

                Higher interest rates should bode ill for gold
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                That perceived haven status has reportedly been behind the strong demand for gold seen since the end of last year

            <p>
                The World Gold Council said that annual gold demand was up 18% in 2022, to 4,714 tonnes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That retracement comes in at $1869.29, well below the current market and a level not in play since January 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the long-term trend for gold looks much less ambiguously bullish

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 1 — Malaysian car manufacturer, Perodua, has unveiled some of the latest specs for the new and improved, entry level car, the Perodua Axia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new Axia model now can potentially travel up to 27.4 kilometres per litre (based on the Malaysian driving cycle mode) compared to the current model which is only 21.6 kilometres per litre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new model is also equipped with Perodua’s Smart Drive Assist — which is the first for an entry level car

                According to Perodua president and chief executive officer Datuk Sri Zainal Abidin Ahmad, the new Axia offers best value for an entry level car

            <p>
                The Caesium-137 capsule lost in transit more than two weeks ago was discovered when a vehicle travelling at 70 km per hour (43 mph) equipped with specialist detection equipment picked up the radiation, according to officials from the state of Western Australia

            <p>
                The search team then used portable detection equipment to find the capsule, which was located about 2 metres from the side of the road in a remote area far from any community, they added

            <p>
                The radioactive capsule was part of a gauge used to measure the density of iron ore feed from Rio Tinto's  Gudai-Darri mine in the state's remote Kimberley region

                Loke said the damage affected the Bandaraya Station and the Masjid Jamek Station, which would be opened only if the track is found safe for use

                Today, Berkshire trades at about $465,000 and Buffett has a net worth of $107 billion
            </p>

                This immediately gives you money from the sale of the option
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the share price doesn’t fall, you keep the money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the price does fall below the strike price, you purchase the stock at a price that’s less than you would have paid at the time you sold the option, with the cash from the option sale further reducing your cost basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The option is considered “naked” because you haven’t secured another option to buy the stock, such as shorting shares of that same stock to offset your purchase cost
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for Buffett, his big misstep recently was investing in airline companies

                CHRISTIAN Eriksen's injury has left Erik ten Hag needing to rethink his Manchester United plans for the remainder of the season

            <p>
                The Brazilian has been at Old Trafford since 2018 but has had to deal with a more limited role this season due to Casemiro's and Eriksen's arrivals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is also possible that Eriksen's injury could trigger a wider tactical change

            <p>
                Ten Hag may wager that no individual player can bring quite what Eriksen excels at and switch formation entirely to a back three
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United have won 11 of the past 13 games with Ten Hag largely sticking to the same team where possible

                About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, Jan 31 — It is “shameful” of the “political bandits” who had recently tried to attempt a coup against Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor to now ask to be part of the new government, said Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) president Datuk Seri Maximus Ongkili
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili, whose PBS is part of the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) ruling coalition, described the three parties — Umno, Parti Warisan and Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Masyarakat (PKDM) — as “power-hungry political bandits” who had created the “disturbance” for their own political gain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Isn’t it a shameful political ploy that after failing to dislodge the chief minister and his government, you suddenly want to be invited to be part of the government?” he asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili, who was the former minister for Sabah and Sarawak affairs, said that he hoped the “cooling off period” called by Umno president and deputy prime minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is welcomed to strengthen political unity and solidarity in the state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sabah had its state elections in September of 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili said that Hajiji now had political support in the State Assembly by way of statutory declarations and hoped it would put to rest any attempt by the three groups to replace the state leadership

                About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, Jan 31 — It is “shameful” of the “political bandits” who had recently tried to attempt a coup against Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor to now ask to be part of the new government, said Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) president Datuk Seri Maximus Ongkili
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili, whose PBS is part of the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) ruling coalition, described the three parties — Umno, Parti Warisan and Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Masyarakat (PKDM) — as “power-hungry political bandits” who had created the “disturbance” for their own political gain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Isn’t it a shameful political ploy that after failing to dislodge the chief minister and his government, you suddenly want to be invited to be part of the government?” he asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili, who was the former minister for Sabah and Sarawak affairs, said that he hoped the “cooling off period” called by Umno president and deputy prime minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is welcomed to strengthen political unity and solidarity in the state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sabah had its state elections in September of 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ongkili said that Hajiji now had political support in the State Assembly by way of statutory declarations and hoped it would put to rest any attempt by the three groups to replace the state leadership

            <p>
                In civil cases, litigants must first get leave from the court before they can proceed to file their appeal to the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her application, the woman wants the Federal Court to determine four questions of law, including in a situation where a Syariah Court order is invalid, can that order be challenged collaterally in the Civil High Court and whether Article 121 (1A) of the Federal Constitution is applicable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On December 12, 2013, the woman filed a summons at the Kuala Lumpur Syariah High Court for a declaration that she was no longer a Muslim and on July 20, 2017, the Syariah High Court dismissed her summons and the Syariah Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal on August 1, 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The woman then filed a suit in the Shah Alam Civil High Court which granted her a declaration that she is not a Muslim

                Surendra said the Federal Court has fixed March 2 for case management of his client’s application for leave to appeal

                "My only appeal is for them to settle this deal with Malaysia because 1MDB is known throughout the world.  "It is there in the books and I think that Goldman Sachs should come out clean and deal with Malaysia,” he said

                It was previously reported that Goldman claimed that Malaysia had "undervalued" the assets already retrieved, as part of its recovery from the scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under a settlement announced in October 2020, Goldman was to pay US$2.5 billion (RM10.7 billion) while guaranteeing the return of US$1.4 billion of 1MDB assets seized by authorities around the world.  According to Bloomberg, the settlement was in exchange for Malaysia to drop charges against Goldman Sachs.  The bank was also to make a one-time interim payment of US$250 million if Malaysia has not received at least US$500 million in assets and proceeds by August 2022.  However, Bloomberg reported that Goldman, in its filing to the United States' Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), had accused Malaysia of having “unilaterally reduced” the value of one asset by US$80 million.  Malaysia was also reportedly declined to include substantial additional assets in accounting of assets and proceeds recovered.  In the Bloomberg interview, Mr Anwar said that Malaysia is supposed to be paid much more than the amount stated in the settlement.  “Given a fair deal, we are supposed to be paid much more than that, which I intend to deal with them, if these things are not settled amicably,” he said in response to Goldman’s claims.  “It’s not my intention – I’m just new in the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How much we can get, I frankly can't say for now, but it's much more than we should be able to do," he said, adding that governments around the world should act more "responsibly" to assist the asset recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to The Star, the Malaysian government in 2018 turned its attention to Goldman Sachs for raising US$6.5 billion in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB.  A huge chunk of the funds - earmarked for development - was, however, diverted to pay bribes to government officials, according to US federal prosecutors.  In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion and the bank also agreed for its Malaysia subsidiary to plead guilty in a US federal court.  Under terms of the deal, Goldman agreed to pay a US$2.3 billion fine for breaking anti-bribery laws and to pay back US$600 million of ill-gotten gains as part of a deferred prosecution agreement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal also requires Goldman to improve its compliance controls.

                Its minister Datuk Seri Salahuddin Ayub said around 12,000 premises have already offered in Menu Rahmah, including restaurants affiliated with the Malaysian Indian Restaurant Owners Association (PRIMAS), the Malaysian Muslim Restaurant Owners Association (PRESMA), Malaysia Singapore Coffee Shop Proprietors General Association (MCSPGA), and Mydin supermarket outlets nationwide
            </p>

            <p>
                “Menu Rahmah” is an initiative to serve lunch or dinner sets at the recommended price of RM5

            <p>
                I have talked to the owners; they say there is still some profit margin but they need to compromise a bit

            <p>
                “We will pay attention to this and always listen to the association and discuss if there’s any problem, but so far they say the RM5 recommended price is doable,” he added.

                Breaking the cost down, DNB said Ericsson’s network equipment, deployment services as well as ongoing maintenance and network management would cost RM4 billion, while the remaining RM7 billion will cover network infrastructure costs from other parties such as tower rental and fibre leasing

            <p>
                The attack, in the Police Lines district, was the deadliest in a decade to hit this restive, northwestern city near the Afghan border and comes amid a surge in violence against the police

                He was responding to claims by Goldman that Malaysia had "undervalued" the assets already retrieved, as part of its recovery from the scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Anwar, the 1MDB scandal is a "crime" committed not only against him, or the Malaysian government, but against all "Malaysians." He urged Goldman to "come clean" and settle the deal with Malaysia as 1MDB was a scandal known throughout the world, and not just dismiss it by flexing the firm's financial muscle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goldman raised US$6.5 billion (RM27.6 billion) in 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion (RM12.3 billion) and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge, to settle probes into the looting of billions of dollars from 1MDB and payment of bribes to win business for the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To a claim by Goldman that Malaysia was intentionally undervaluing the assets to force Goldman to pay a US$250 million interim payment, Anwar said that under a "fair deal", Malaysia was supposed to have been paid much more than that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "How much we can get, I frankly can't say for now, but it's much more than we should be able to do (sic)," he said, urging governments around the world to act more "responsibly" to assist the asset recovery.

                Mohd Hatta Sanuri, who filed the suit through Messrs Mohaji, Hazury & Ismail on Dec 30 last year, also named former Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Economy) Mustapa Mohamed, former transport minister Wee Ka Siong and the government as the three other defendants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the statement of claim, Mohd Hatta said Dr Mahathir, who was then prime minister, had committed tort misfeasance in public office when he decided to postpone the HSR project, causing the government and the Malaysian people to pay compensation of almost RM46 million (S$14.2 million) to the Singapore Government
            </p>

                He claimed that Muhyiddin also committed tort misfeasance in public office for terminating the project when he was prime minister, causing the Malaysian government and the people to pay RM320.3 million as compensation for the cancellation of the bilateral agreement between Malaysia and Singapore.  Mohd Hatta also claimed that Mustapha, who was responsible for managing the project, had committed a similar offence by shelving the project, while Wee committed tort misfeasance in public office for denying Malaysians their right to enjoy a first-class transport system

            <p>
                On Jan 1, 2021, Malaysia and Singapore announced the termination of the 350km HSR project as the two countries failed to reach an agreement on changes proposed by Malaysia before the expiry of the project agreement on Dec 31, 2020

                The MOU was signed by Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil and his Singapore counterpart Josephine Teo, and witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and his counterpart Lee Hsien Loong in Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cooperation on cybersecurity includes the exchange of knowledge and expertise on best practices, coordination and organisation of capacity-building activities and exchange in information on analyses, experiences and guidance regarding cyberattacks and cybersecurity incidents, concerns or threats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It also includes designation of an authorised national cybersecurity lead agency by each participant for the purpose of establishing an annual Malaysia-Singapore Cybersecurity Roundtable.” On the digital economy, the ministry said the agreement involves the exchange of information on best practices, policies and regulations, including on digitalisation, interoperable standards and new emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On another matter, Anwar – who was in Singapore on a one-day official visit – said he sees food security as one area of cooperation that can be explored with Singapore for the benefit of both countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This area (food security) that I think we would solicit support for Singapore to use Malaysia as the heartland to produce for the benefit of both countries,” he said in his toast speech at an official lunch hosted by Lee yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>

                The MOU was signed by Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil and his Singapore counterpart Josephine Teo, and witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and his counterpart Lee Hsien Loong in Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cooperation on cybersecurity includes the exchange of knowledge and expertise on best practices, coordination and organisation of capacity-building activities and exchange in information on analyses, experiences and guidance regarding cyberattacks and cybersecurity incidents, concerns or threats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It also includes designation of an authorised national cybersecurity lead agency by each participant for the purpose of establishing an annual Malaysia-Singapore Cybersecurity Roundtable.” On the digital economy, the ministry said the agreement involves the exchange of information on best practices, policies and regulations, including on digitalisation, interoperable standards and new emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On another matter, Anwar – who was in Singapore on a one-day official visit – said he sees food security as one area of cooperation that can be explored with Singapore for the benefit of both countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This area (food security) that I think we would solicit support for Singapore to use Malaysia as the heartland to produce for the benefit of both countries,” he said in his toast speech at an official lunch hosted by Lee yesterday

                Last Friday, Rapid Rail Sdn Bhd stopped trains from passing the station after the tracks became bent following movements in the concrete segment supporting the rail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From the ground below, observers saw cracks on the upper parts of the pier, which is a reinforced concrete structure that sits within Sungai Gombak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A visual examination of the pier, sandwiched between a DBKL office block and the Gombak river, found that cracks had developed at the upper part of the pier that holds up the concrete segment that in turn supports the rail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Depending on site context, a railway protection zone in Malaysia extends several metres from the edge of the rail or pier or rail tunnel, and any work within these areas, even if on privately-owned land, requires Apad approval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bent rail was discovered after a train driver reported unusual vibrations when passing through that part of the network, which opened for service in December 1996, implying the pier should be at least 30 years old

                Last Friday, Rapid Rail Sdn Bhd stopped trains from passing the station after the tracks became bent following movements in the concrete segment supporting the rail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From the ground below, observers saw cracks on the upper parts of the pier, which is a reinforced concrete structure that sits within Sungai Gombak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A visual examination of the pier, sandwiched between a DBKL office block and the Gombak river, found that cracks had developed at the upper part of the pier that holds up the concrete segment that in turn supports the rail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Depending on site context, a railway protection zone in Malaysia extends several metres from the edge of the rail or pier or rail tunnel, and any work within these areas, even if on privately-owned land, requires Apad approval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bent rail was discovered after a train driver reported unusual vibrations when passing through that part of the network, which opened for service in December 1996, implying the pier should be at least 30 years old

                Still, despite the record loss, the value of the fund rose overall by 89 billion crowns or $8.9 billion year-on-year, partly due to the weak Norwegian currency and a record 1.1 trillion crowns of cash inflows

            <p>
                Still, despite the record loss, the value of the fund rose overall by 89 billion crowns or $8.9 billion year-on-year, partly due to the weak Norwegian currency and a record 1.1 trillion crowns of cash inflows

            <p>
                The fund invests the Norwegian state's revenues from petroleum production

                "And then of course we have still geopolitical hotspots." The fund's return on investment in 2022 stood at minus 14.1% for the year, which was 0.88 percentage point better than the return on the fund's benchmark index

                Flamengo right-back Wesley, 19, was also an option but talks have gone cold and Barca are focusing on Mexico international Araujo, who was capped by the United States before switching his international allegiance

                Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the body responsible for match officials across English football, has admitted Liverpool midfielder Fabinho should have been sent off for his challenge on Brighton & Hove Albion forward Evan Ferguson in Sunday's FA Cup tie

                Malaysia had raised the debt limit to 60% of gross domestic product from 55% in 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, and lifted it further to 65% in 2021 to make room for additional borrowings to fund fiscal stimulus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s actual debt is at 61% of GDP, and the law under which the ceiling was raised lapsed on Dec 31
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Malaysia remains A-rated by credit agencies Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, a reduction in government debt ratio will be key to winning a higher credit score from Fitch Ratings Ltd, which is currently the only one of the three main rating companies to have a lower BBB+ rating on the South-East Asian nation

                Anwar, who doubles as Finance Minister, is set to table the revised 2023 Budget to Parliament on Feb 24 and has been preaching fiscal prudence as the South-East Asian nation stares down still-elevated debt levels in the wake of a Covid-era spending drive

            <p>
                Earlier this month, Anwar had warned that this year’s fiscal position won’t be comfortable, with about RM1.5 trillion in total debt and liabilities and a budget deficit setting around 5.8% of gross domestic product as of last year

                Earlier, it was reported that the prosecution team had requested for the 1MDB trial to be deferred for today and tomorrow

            <p>
                Deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib this morning informed the High Court that although today was scheduled for the continued hearing of Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s 1MDB trial, they were asking for a postponement

            <p>
                Sri Ram was also the lead prosecutor for Rosmah’s trial over the soliciting and receiving of millions of ringgit in bribes in exchange for helping to secure a RM1.25 billion contract, and her separate money-laundering trial — which has yet to start — involving over RM7 million.

                The Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform) said the court described the claimants’ conduct of voluntarily omitting their real addresses from their filings as constituting a "manifestly illicit hardship” that was detrimental to Malaysia

            <p>
                Last week, Azalina had announced the lifting of the attachment order by the court

                According to Azalina, Malaysia had applied to the District Court of Luxembourg to obtain interim relief to release the attachment and the hearing took place on Dec 5
            </p>

                Azalina stressed that the government would be unrelenting in its efforts to protect and preserve Malaysia’s interests, sovereign immunity and sovereignty at all times, and continue to take all necessary action to put an end to the claimants’ fictitious claim

            <p>
                "The Higher Education Ministry will be professional, fair, objective and not political," he said, adding that the leadership must be authoritative and perform in their roles

                He added that the ministry would look into access and financing of higher education including exploring the flexible education space as well as exploring the possibility of turning the National Higher Education Fund Corporation (PTPTN) into a national trust fund

            <p>
                "It wouldn't be a surprise if this affected Brighton's valuation of Moisés Caicedo, for instance." We've seen how the transfer market can be reshaped by a single deal, creating a new reference point, and Brighton may well point to Fernández as part of the basis for its price tag

            <p>
                All of this is, of course, a huge concern for Liverpool as it confronts a crucial midfield rebuild this summer

                All of this is, of course, a huge concern for Liverpool as it confronts a crucial midfield rebuild this summer

                File photo of an older littoral combat ship, the Maharaja Lela, at a naval shipyard in Lumut, Perak in 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee said the project to construct six ships was awarded by the Ministry of Defence to Boustead Naval Shipyard through direct negotiation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among those called up to the proceedings were former defence minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi who is currently one of the two deputy prime ministers in the unity government of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also called up to the proceedings were then-defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein who  held the portfolio from May 2013 to May 2018, former navy head Admiral Abdul Aziz Jaafar and officials from Boustead subsidiaries
            </p>

                Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Aziz at the Shopee headquarters in Singapore on Jan 29, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shopee is the largest pan-regional e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan.  Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tengku Zafrul Aziz announced this move during his official visit to the company’s headquarters in Singapore on Sunday (Jan 29).  Sea's decision to expand its investment footprint in Malaysia reflects the company’s confidence in the prospects, as well as the operational and policy stability of the country’s business landscape, he added.  During the minister's visit, Sea shared its proposed expansion plans in Malaysia, involving the setting up of cloud computing services, data hosting and processing, as well as a new logistics e-commerce warehouse.  The cloud computing project will be located in a three-storey green facility in the Johor town of Kulai, said Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This includes local sourcing, vendor development and the strengthening of the local industrial ecosystem, particularly in the digital space," said Tengku Zafrul.  Tengku Zafrul's three-day investment mission to Singapore is in conjunction with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s first official visit to the country on Monday.  During the visit, he will also have one-on-one business meetings with the Yondr Group, a global leader in data centres and INSEACT, a Singapore-based alternative protein company which specialises in producing sustainable insect protein for aquaculture.  Sea's co-founder and group chief operating officer, Gang Ye said the decision was a significant development not just for the group, but also for the local digital ecosystem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sea has also laid off more than 7,000 employees - or about 10 per cent of its workforce - as of December last year.  Staff cuts were also made at Garena in September 2022, including the shutting down some major projects to boost Sea's profitability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That same month, more Shopee employees were also laid off, with some of them having their job offers rescinded days before they began work.

                Azalina said the court found such conduct by the alleged Sulu heirs to amount to a "manifestly illicit hardship" that is detrimental to Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak in 2010 declared Stampa as having no jurisdiction over Malaysia and ordered a stop to the continued arbitrations in Spain, Stampa and the Sulu claimants ignored a Spanish court's decision to cancel his appointment and shifted the entire arbitration to France
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ignoring the Spanish and French courts' decisions which meant the arbitration was illegitimate, Stampa on February 28, 2022, gave his arbitration decision — also known as the "final award" — to order Malaysia to pay US$14.92 billion to the eight Sulu claimants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia is currently challenging this ex parte order before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the seizure order issued in July 2022, Azalina said Malaysia had immediately applied to the District Court of Luxembourg to obtain an interim relief to release or set aside the seizure order known as "saisie arrêt"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After a December 5 hearing, the District Court of Luxembourg on January 24 set aside the seizure order

                About Us Advertise   SINGAPORE, Jan 30 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has urged Singapore to examine the reclamations carried out in the Batu Puteh area to ensure they were not affecting the environment and the country’s borders with Malaysia

            <p>
                Zambry added that the Malaysia-Singapore Leaders’ Retreat would be a mechanism to "resolve any problems or issues" in more "detail"

                "Prime Minister will also hold an engagement with the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore," said the statement
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Anwar will be accompanied by his wife, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, and the delegation will comprise foreign affairs minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, Minister of Transport Anthony Loke Siew Fook, Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, Minister of Communications and Digital Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil, and officials from the relevant ministries and agencies

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 29 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will undertake his first official visit to Singapore tomorrow (Jan 30) at the invitation of his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian Foreign Ministry (Wisma Putra), in a statement, said Anwar – in his maiden visit to the republic after being sworn in as the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia – will be meeting President Halimah Yacob and Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Prime Minister will also hold an engagement with the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore," said the statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement said the visit reflects the importance of the Malaysia-Singapore ties as close neighbours and partners in Asean
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar will be accompanied by his wife, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, and the delegation will comprise foreign affairs minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, Minister of Transport Anthony Loke Siew Fook, Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, Minister of Communications and Digital Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil, and officials from the relevant ministries and agencies

            <p>
                Separately, Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said that Anwar’s visit to Singapore “underscores the close and enduring relationship between Singapore and Malaysia, and our peoples.” The ministry said Anwar will attend an official welcome ceremony at the Istana

                Mohamed Salah has struggled to produce his best form for Liverpool this season It's not just Saturday, since the World Cup or even this season that Salah has looked a little off form
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                The end result right now though is Salah's source for chances is not delivering the goods like it once did
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Granted, he isn't quite man-marked out of game given his modest goals record this season but Liverpool's often relatively ponderous attacking build up is detrimental to Salah's game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp's tactics this term have forced Salah out to the right and have limited the forward Salah's drop in form could also come from a factor that no footballer can beat..

                Washington's allegations that North Korea has provided arms to Russia are a "baseless" effort to justify its own military aid to Ukraine, Kwon Chung-keun, director of US affairs at North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA

                The baseless claims of North Korea-Russia arms deals are an "unacceptable and a grave provocation that must be responded to," Kwon added

            <p>
                US and South Korean officials have also warned the North could be preparing for its first test of a nuclear device since 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The White House said in December that North Korea completed an initial arms delivery of infantry rockets and missiles to a private Russian military company, the Wagner Group, to shore up Russian forces in Ukraine.

            <p>
                The baseless claims of North Korea-Russia arms deals are an "unacceptable and a grave provocation that must be responded to," Kwon added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                US and South Korean officials have also warned the North could be preparing for its first test of a nuclear device since 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The White House said in December that North Korea completed an initial arms delivery of infantry rockets and missiles to a private Russian military company, the Wagner Group, to shore up Russian forces in Ukraine.

            <p>
                China’s draconian zero-Covid policy only heightened challenges for Chinese clubs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saudi Arabia harbours significant ambitions with the country due to host the 2027 Asian Cup, while launching a bid to organise the 2026 Women’s Asian Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those moves come after China was forced last year to relinquish the rights to the 2023 Asian Cup as its zero-Covid policy had no end in sight at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While restrictions were finally relaxed last month in a dramatic U-turn, significant damage has been done to football in China

                The downturn in Chinese football has spared few

            <p>
                Two-time Asian champions Guangzhou FC, once Chinese football’s dominant force, went into decline after their owners, developers China Evergrande, were forced to limit funding after the government restricted borrowing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China’s draconian zero-Covid policy only heightened challenges for Chinese clubs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saudi Arabia harbours significant ambitions with the country due to host the 2027 Asian Cup, while launching a bid to organise the 2026 Women’s Asian Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those moves come after China was forced last year to relinquish the rights to the 2023 Asian Cup as its zero-Covid policy had no end in sight at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While restrictions were finally relaxed last month in a dramatic U-turn, significant damage has been done to football in China

                Now that Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and his allies are in full control of Umno, their actions might have spooked the other detractors in Umno such as former PM Ismail Sabri Yaakob and the like
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My take is that the suspended Umno leaders would opt to start up a new party and thus forcing several by-elections because of the anti-hopping law
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yes, Umno may well then take the path trodden by MCA
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This may, in the long run, be better for the Anwar government

                On the positive side, a surge in consumption will boost export demand elsewhere

                On the plus side, a big rise in consumption might add to global demand

                There remains the question of whether supply chain congestion is that much of a problem at all

                Although overall consumption has softened, relative demand for durables remains high, meaning that demand-led congestion could conceivably reappear if Chinese consumption roars back

            <p>
                “Our TRUST in Congress Act would demonstrate that lawmakers are focused on serving the interests of the American people — not their own stock portfolios.” If passed, both PELOSI and TRUST would ban members of Congress, their spouses and children from trading individual stocks and force them to place their investment assets into blind trusts

            <p>
                In a mic drop moment in the debate around insider trading in Congress, Sen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Today, I’m introducing legislation to BAN stock trading & ownership by members of Congress
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I call it the PELOSI Act.” Hawley’s bill, which some have bashed as an act of political showmanship, is the latest attempt to prevent insider trading from members of Congress - a movement that has gained “tremendous momentum” in recent months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PELOSI Act is a rewrite of a bill that Hawley proposed in the 117th Congress, which failed to get a single cosponsor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our TRUST in Congress Act would demonstrate that lawmakers are focused on serving the interests of the American people — not their own stock portfolios.” If passed, both PELOSI and TRUST would ban members of Congress, their spouses and children from trading individual stocks and force them to place their investment assets into blind trusts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite being targeted for alleged insider trading, even Pelosi has championed a bill trying to tackle the problem in Congress

                Liverpool's press may have faltered this season, but a new Jürgen Klopp playmaker could be emerging, justifying a massive transfer call in the process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Núñez was Liverpool’s big summer signing in 2022, signed partly off the back of two impressive performances against Liverpool for Benfica in the Champions League

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Núñez's sheer force of will, and willingness to run all over the final third, can in essence be a playmaker for Liverpool

                Liverpool's press may have faltered this season, but a new Jürgen Klopp playmaker could be emerging, justifying a massive transfer call in the process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Núñez was Liverpool’s big summer signing in 2022, signed partly off the back of two impressive performances against Liverpool for Benfica in the Champions League

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Núñez's sheer force of will, and willingness to run all over the final third, can in essence be a playmaker for Liverpool

                The defender has reportedly submitted a transfer request in an attempt to force a move away

            <p>
                Inter Milan are known to be interested in signing the former England international

            <p>
                Inter had been expected to make a free transfer swoop for the defender at the end of the season, but an agreement could be made as soon as next week if Roma choose to let their man go

                Nga, who is also the Kepayang assemblyman, said the Kepayang Ipoh Residency, which consists of 252 apartment units, is one of the sick projects that has been successfully revived and completed; it is also equipped with facilities such as a multi-purpose hall, kindergarten, surau, nursery and playground
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said apart from Kepayang Residency, PR1MA also has 10 other projects in Perak, including Falim Residency, Kampung Paloh Residency, Meru Residency, and Bandar Baru Setia Awan Perdana Residency
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise IPOH, Jan 28 — The Ministry of Local Government Development (KPKT) will scrutinise every sick and abandoned housing project nationwide, to ensure the welfare and rights of buyers are protected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nga, who is also the Kepayang assemblyman, said the Kepayang Ipoh Residency, which consists of 252 apartment units, is one of the sick projects that has been successfully revived and completed; it is also equipped with facilities such as a multi-purpose hall, kindergarten, surau, nursery and playground
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said apart from Kepayang Residency, PR1MA also has 10 other projects in Perak, including Falim Residency, Kampung Paloh Residency, Meru Residency, and Bandar Baru Setia Awan Perdana Residency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In the first 100 days, KPKT aims to complete nearly 5,000 units of affordable housing, including this residency, and several in other states
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said through agencies under KPKT to date, there are more than 90 affordable housing projects, covering 40,000 housing units, in Perak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, there was also the signing of documents of understanding between PR1MA and Koperasi Co-opbank Pertama Malaysia Berhad (Co-opbank Pertama) for the CBP MyPR1MA Housing scheme, which provides home financing of up to 110 per cent, with a rate as low as 3.85 per cent, for property priced between RM 250,000 to RM 500,000 per unit

                Hasni, who refused to divulge his next course of action, said as a person who wanted the party to be dominant in Johor, he would not just be sitting around and doing nothing after his removal as state Umno chairman

            <p>
                Hasni reminded his party leadership that whatever decision made in Umno should not be at the expense of giving an edge to other parties who were already wooing some of the leaders who were sacked or suspended

                Meor Azuan Hassan celebrates Shello Silverius' goal during their game against Japan at the Birsa Munda Stadium in Rourkela
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wily midfielder Shello Silverius was the toast with two goals in the seventh and 31st minute to end his World Cup campaign with three goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan's goals were scored by Kaito Tanaka (23rd minute) and Seren Tanaka (31st)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means Malaysia will end their World Cup in 13th, an improvement compared to their 2018 outing, where they were booted out of the group stages and finished 15th.

                The Local Government Development Minister said the same people when in power had gone to Singapore to do the same, but failed to do so

                He said what was important was that the ministry wanted the best for the country and the people, and it did not matter where the best came from

            <p>
                Nga said that was their only objective, and Singapore’s Housing Development Board was recognised as one of the best in the world, thus there was no harm to learn from them

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 28 — The real threat to the survival of the ethnic Malay community and Malaysia as a whole is corruption as well as leaders who steal the country’s wealth, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today

                Shares in the business empire of Asia's richest man Gautam Adani nosedived after a US investment firm claimed it had committed "brazen" corporate fraud
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indian billionaire Gautam Adani addresses delegates during the Bengal Global Business Summit in Kolkata, India on Apr 20, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani was born in Ahmedabad to a middle-class family but dropped out of school at 16 and moved to the financial capital Mumbai to find work in the lucrative gems trade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani is seen as an acolyte of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow Gujarat native, and has aligned his own business interests with those of "nation building"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani batted away press freedom fears, but told the Financial Times that journalists should have the "courage" to say "when the government is doing the right thing every day"
            </p>

                Shares in the business empire of Asia's richest man Gautam Adani nosedived after a US investment firm claimed it had committed "brazen" corporate fraud
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indian billionaire Gautam Adani addresses delegates during the Bengal Global Business Summit in Kolkata, India on Apr 20, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani was born in Ahmedabad to a middle-class family but dropped out of school at 16 and moved to the financial capital Mumbai to find work in the lucrative gems trade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani is seen as an acolyte of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow Gujarat native, and has aligned his own business interests with those of "nation building"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani batted away press freedom fears, but told the Financial Times that journalists should have the "courage" to say "when the government is doing the right thing every day"

                Friday was Auckland’s wettest day on record, with heavy rain triggering a state of emergency in the city of about 1.6 million people.   Emergency workers and a man wade through floodwaters in Auckland, New Zealand on Jan 27, 2023

                Jurgen Klopp admitted forward Mo Salah is suffering from inconsistencies in Liverpool's form Klopp (left) has however insisted that his star man will return to his previous form in the future This all feels very different for Liverpool, who had the best front three in Europe last season

                What may be surprising, however, is that a popular recent answer to that retirement amount question — Fidelity Investments’ counsel to sock away 10 times your current annual income by age 67 — may be one of the most misleading pieces of advice on the retirement web
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But some financial experts believe Fidelity’s 10 times guidance undershoots the real cost of retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only would that leave you exposed, it could undermine the feeling of financial independence we all want in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Consider Fidelity’s own 2022 guidance that a retiring 65-year-old American couple can expect to spend $315,000 on medical and health expenses in retirement, a 5% jump over 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Using a retirement calculator, a 53-year-old making $100,000 a year, with $500,000 in their 401(k) and who plans to retire at 67, would have to save at least $3,300 a month — or nearly 40% of their income — to reach a nest egg of about $1.6 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s also possible your needs, and costs, may diminish in retirement

                What may be surprising, however, is that a popular recent answer to that retirement amount question — Fidelity Investments’ counsel to sock away 10 times your current annual income by age 67 — may be one of the most misleading pieces of advice on the retirement web
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But some financial experts believe Fidelity’s 10 times guidance undershoots the real cost of retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only would that leave you exposed, it could undermine the feeling of financial independence we all want in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Consider Fidelity’s own 2022 guidance that a retiring 65-year-old American couple can expect to spend $315,000 on medical and health expenses in retirement, a 5% jump over 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Using a retirement calculator, a 53-year-old making $100,000 a year, with $500,000 in their 401(k) and who plans to retire at 67, would have to save at least $3,300 a month — or nearly 40% of their income — to reach a nest egg of about $1.6 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s also possible your needs, and costs, may diminish in retirement

                The states of Johor, Pahang and Sabah have been hit by flooding amid continuous heavy rain brought about by the northeast monsoon.  Nearly 14,000 people in the three states were in temporary flood relief centres, Bernama reported on Saturday morning, but that number fell significantly by evening.  “I don’t think a flood emergency should be declared because it only involves certain states and districts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The state disaster management committees have taken proactive measures together with the district disaster management committees,” said Ahmad Zahid, who is also the chairman of the Central Disaster Management Committee
            </p>

                “The aid provided has been given to all the heads of families and, at the same time, we have other matters that need to be carried out, including post-flood assistance,” he told a media conference after visiting a temporary relief centre in Mersing.  Ahmad Zahid, who is also the rural and regional development minister, added that the government will look into improving coordination among non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the relevant agencies involved in post-flood management
            </p>

                When asked to comment on political developments a day after his party UMNO expelled former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin and suspended former defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein, Ahmad Zahid, who is party president, said he would only address flood-related questions.  “This is a press conference on flood matters only," he said, as quoted by the Star.  UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), Malaysia’s oldest political party, expelled Khairy and supreme council member Noh Omar on Friday for breaching party disciplinary rules during the country’s recent general election

                "That's my approach so I'm looking around, to research but I have an idea with which profiles we could strengthen the squad." United are the only English team left in four competitions and Ten Hag is keen to have a squad big enough to cope with the demands of a season that could stretch to more than 60 games

                Interest from West Ham in defender Harry Maguire has been rebuffed and Ten Hag has insisted the United captain remains an important player

            <p>
                "[The decision] is not taken [that he will leave] until now, the decision about that is for the summer, but for the whole season he's injured," Ten Hag said

            <p>
                "What I can say is that he's not available for training since the first day of training this season so I think there's not an opportunity for you to recover quickly and be available quickly."

                "That's my approach so I'm looking around, to research but I have an idea with which profiles we could strengthen the squad." United are the only English team left in four competitions and Ten Hag is keen to have a squad big enough to cope with the demands of a season that could stretch to more than 60 games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Interest from West Ham in defender Harry Maguire has been rebuffed and Ten Hag has insisted the United captain remains an important player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He's not fifth choice but it's up to him," Ten Hag said

            <p>
                The defender hasn't played all season because of injury and is out of contract in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "[The decision] is not taken [that he will leave] until now, the decision about that is for the summer, but for the whole season he's injured," Ten Hag said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "What I can say is that he's not available for training since the first day of training this season so I think there's not an opportunity for you to recover quickly and be available quickly."

                Former FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces fraud charges over the collapse of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, leaves on the day of a hearing at Manhattan federal court in New York City, US on Jan 3, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried, 30, has been free on a US$250 million bond since pleading not guilty to charges of fraud in the looting of billions of dollars from the now-bankrupt FTX
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prosecutors said their request was in response to Bankman-Fried's recent effort to contact a potential witness against him, the general counsel of an FTX affiliate, and was needed to prevent witness tampering and other obstruction of justice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They said a Signal ban isn't necessary because Bankman-Fried is not using the auto-delete feature, and the concern that he might is "unfounded"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyers also asked to remove a bail condition preventing Bankman-Fried from accessing FTX, Alameda or cryptocurrency assets, saying there was "no evidence" he was responsible for earlier alleged unauthorised transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an order on Saturday, Kaplan gave prosecutors until Monday to address Bankman-Fried's concerns

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 27 — The Malaysian chapter of a pro-caliphate group Hizbur Tahrir mounted its second demonstration outside the Embassy of the Netherlands here after Friday prayers this afternoon, protesting the desecration of a Quran by a Dutch political leader earlier this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some 80 members of the group, including children, had earlier held a peaceful protest outside the Swedish Embassy on Jalan Mayang Sari this morning, to condemn the burning of a Quran by Swedish-Danish politician Rasmus Paludan who leads a Danish party called Stram Kurs (which means Hard Line) outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed Oskam had “apologised” on behalf of the Netherlands government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But for us, the one who did it must apologise and the Netherlands government itself must apologise to all Muslims because the one who did it said his action was allowed by the government,” he told the demonstrators after meeting the Dutch representatives
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mu’adz also claimed that Muslim leaders did not do enough to give a “stern warning” over Wagensveld’s action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More than 50 policemen in uniform and plain clothes were observed watching the demonstration outside the Dutch Embassy

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 27 — The Malaysian chapter of a pro-caliphate group Hizbur Tahrir mounted its second demonstration outside the Embassy of the Netherlands here after Friday prayers this afternoon, protesting the desecration of a Quran by a Dutch political leader earlier this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some 80 members of the group, including children, had earlier held a peaceful protest outside the Swedish Embassy on Jalan Mayang Sari this morning, to condemn the burning of a Quran by Swedish-Danish politician Rasmus Paludan who leads a Danish party called Stram Kurs (which means Hard Line) outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm last week

                He claimed Oskam had “apologised” on behalf of the Netherlands government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But for us, the one who did it must apologise and the Netherlands government itself must apologise to all Muslims because the one who did it said his action was allowed by the government,” he told the demonstrators after meeting the Dutch representatives
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mu’adz also claimed that Muslim leaders did not do enough to give a “stern warning” over Wagensveld’s action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More than 50 policemen in uniform and plain clothes were observed watching the demonstration outside the Dutch Embassy

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 27 — Hundreds of Perikatan Nasional (PN) supporters led by Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia deputy president Datuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu marched to the Swedish Embassy on Jalan Mayang Sari here this afternoon in another show of protest against a recent Quran burning in Stockholm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have no quarrel with the Swedish nationals but we are very disappointed with their politician for burning the Quran,” he said as the crowd cheered in agreement

            <p>
                Stressing that the government is not doing enough, PAS Youth chief and Pasir Mas MP, Ahmad Fadhli Shaari urged the government to have a dialogue with Swedish Ambassador in Malaysia, Joachim Bergström
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We want the government to rise and talk about the matter with the Swedish ambassador regarding this disgusting act by their politician,” he said

            <p>
                Despite his request, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already called up the Swedish embassy over the matter yesterday

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 27 — Hundreds of Perikatan Nasional (PN) supporters led by Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia deputy president Datuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu marched to the Swedish Embassy on Jalan Mayang Sari here this afternoon in another show of protest against a recent Quran burning in Stockholm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have no quarrel with the Swedish nationals but we are very disappointed with their politician for burning the Quran,” he said as the crowd cheered in agreement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stressing that the government is not doing enough, PAS Youth chief and Pasir Mas MP, Ahmad Fadhli Shaari urged the government to have a dialogue with Swedish Ambassador in Malaysia, Joachim Bergström
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We want the government to rise and talk about the matter with the Swedish ambassador regarding this disgusting act by their politician,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his request, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already called up the Swedish embassy over the matter yesterday
            </p>

                About Us Advertise   SEPANG, Jan 27 — Some Malaysians who had lucrative jobs in Cambodia's scam syndicates have made their way back there even after being rescued, Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Abd Jalil Hassan said today

                On January 18, 2023, BMW of North America announced a safety recall for all 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP motorcycles due to the potential risk of a broken gearbox input shaft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This could, in turn, block the rear wheel, which could increase the risk of a crash.  According to BMW, approximately 18,489 motorcycles are involved in this recall, which represents 100 percent of the population
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BMW intensified its analysis of the issue, and eventually determined that if there is an abrupt difference between the engine speed and the rotational speed of the final drive component, the gearbox input shaft could become overloaded, and break as a result
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s why BMW decided to issue this recall.  Owners will be notified via postal mail that they should stop riding their affected bikes and contact their local authorized BMW dealer for recall service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BMW has also issued a Stop Sale notice to its dealers for all affected 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP bikes until recall service has been performed.  BMW North America notified its dealer network about this recall on January 18, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Owners may contact BMW customer service at 1-800-525-7417

                Initial jobless claims of 186,000 came in lower than the 205,000 expected for last week and also below the week before that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed will meet next week to decide on the next step for interest rates, and most expect it will raise by another quarter of a percentage point, which is a smaller increment than at its previous meetings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That implies another rate hike or two after next week’s meeting if the Fed meets expectations

                The Nasdaq is up 2.7% so far this week and on pace for its best month since last summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter compared with the third, a sign the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate increases last year are kicking in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Initial jobless claims of 186,000 came in lower than the 205,000 expected for last week and also below the week before that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed will meet next week to decide on the next step for interest rates, and most expect it will raise by another quarter of a percentage point, which is a smaller increment than at its previous meetings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That implies another rate hike or two after next week’s meeting if the Fed meets expectations

            <p>
                Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming of Universiti Malaya, a public health expert, said Malaysia has been one of the best countries in managing Covid-19 and has handled the pandemic well despite some initial hiccups

            <p>
                Public health expert Prof Dr Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia said the high number of deaths was unavoidable at one point as there was a severe health resource shortage and a lack of facilities, as well as proper isolation centres

            <p>
                Universiti Malaya professor of epidemiology and public health Prof Dr Sanjay Rampal said while the Health Ministry responded well to the initial pandemic, future resilience would be highly dependent on investments in public health and healthcare systems

                Julien Laurens warns Lyon's hot prospect Malo Gusto about making a big-money move to Chelsea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I have the pleasure to explain that Malo Gusto, one of Lyon's big talents, will continue to play for Lyon until at least June 30 2023" Aulas said on social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gusto, 19, is out of contract with Lyon in June 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aulas closing the door on a potential move could be seen as him trying to put pressure on Chelsea to increase their first offer and agree to let Gusto stay at Lyon on loan until the end of the season, which Chelsea have refused to agree to so far in the negotiations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gusto has now played 47 times already with Lyon, his hometown club, including some European games and he is also on Didier Deschamps' radar for the national team after having represented France in every youth team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gusto is a very attacking right back with great pace and crossing ability.

                "I have the pleasure to explain that Malo Gusto, one of Lyon's big talents, will continue to play for Lyon until at least June 30 2023" Aulas said on social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gusto, 19, is out of contract with Lyon in June 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aulas closing the door on a potential move could be seen as him trying to put pressure on Chelsea to increase their first offer and agree to let Gusto stay at Lyon on loan until the end of the season, which Chelsea have refused to agree to so far in the negotiations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gusto has now played 47 times already with Lyon, his hometown club, including some European games and he is also on Didier Deschamps' radar for the national team after having represented France in every youth team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gusto is a very attacking right back with great pace and crossing ability.

                The most important type of semiconductor production equipment subject to US export restrictions is EUV (Extreme Ultra-Violet) lithography, which is monopolized by ASML
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ASML has not sold any EUV lithography systems to China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rather, China would not be able to add much new semiconductor production capacity without developing its own equipment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But EUV lithography accounted for 46%, so China accounted for 26% of the remainder

            <p>
                Only 40 of the 345 lithography units sold by ASML in 2022 were EUV
