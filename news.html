                What Are RMDs? You don’t pay taxes on the money in your IRA or 401(k) when you put it in, which is why these accounts are considered tax-advantaged retirement accounts

            <p>
                The new Proton X90 is the first ever Proton car with a mild hybrid system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But rather than call it a hybrid car, Proton has chosen to call it a New Energy Vehicle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Oh and if you are wondering if Proton would ever introduce a mild hybrid system for the X50 and X70, Proton basically said never say never

            <p>
                This is because health services are a critical service especially because it involves human lives and the well-being of the people,“ he said in a statement today

                However, Dr Noor Hisham stated that the Ministry of Health (MoH ) did not have any further information about the strike, and instead only received announcements through social media channels

            <p>
                Dr Noor Hisham said health services in this country must continue to be considered as a critical sector including health workers because of the complexity, challenges, risks and hard work that health workers have to face in carrying out their duties and responsibilities

                “A strike can generally cause a service to be affected for as long as it is organised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because health services are a critical service especially because it involves human lives and the well-being of the people,“ he said in a statement today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Dr Noor Hisham stated that the Ministry of Health (MoH ) did not have any further information about the strike, and instead only received announcements through social media channels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hopefully health services can be further strengthened in the coming year,“ he said

            <p>
                Dr Noor Hisham said health services in this country must continue to be considered as a critical sector including health workers because of the complexity, challenges, risks and hard work that health workers have to face in carrying out their duties and responsibilities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Therefore, health workers who are the main assets of the Health Service need to continue to be given due attention, including appropriate remuneration for their services,“ he said

                Batu Pahat OCPD Asst Comm Ismail Dollah said the accident occurred at 3.30pm on Monday (March 27) when two of the suspects, aged 31 and 39, were in an SUV trailing a Proton car from Tongkang Pechah to Parit Sulong
            </p>

                “The car came to a sudden halt

            <p>
                The SUV could not stop in time and crashed into the back of the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The driver, 42, and passenger, 43, of the other car suffered minor injuries," ACP Ismail said in a statement on Wednesday (March 29)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The case would be investigated under Section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act 1987 for causing death by reckless driving, Section 304(b) of the Penal Code for causing death by negligence, and Section 379 of the Penal Code for theft, he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an unrelated case, ACP Ismail said police were looking for two men who broke into a house and injured a 64-year-old woman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The case was being investigated under Section 394 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing harm while committing a robbery, ACP Ismail added.

                Anwar, who is also the Finance Minister when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 or the national budget for the second reading in the Dewan Negara today said that the new additional initiative involves Aidilfitri assistance, an extension of individual tax relief and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for net savings in the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) until 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will incur losses of RM250 million per year in the government’s revenue, but will benefit approximately 400,000 taxpayers,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister also announced that starting April 1 this year, the government will expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to fixed and irregular income groups to have their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Anwar said the government would also give priority to the filling of public service positions in critical sectors, especially health and education, and this is expected to involve an additional expenditure of up to RM800 million this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Budget 2023 including the additional initiatives proved the Unity Government’s commitment to bring changes to Malaysia, and also proof of the government’s determination to improve governance to ensure the well-being of the people as a whole

                Anwar, who is also the Finance Minister, when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 or the national budget for the second reading in the Dewan Negara today said that the new additional initiative involves Aidilfitri assistance, an extension of individual tax relief and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)

            <p>
                "So, the government has agreed to give another RM200 in the Special Aidilfitri Assistance to 850,000 rubber smallholders, paddy farmers and fishermen, in addition to what was announced before
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for net savings in the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) until 2024
            </p>

                The prime minister also announced that starting April 1 this year, the government will expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to fixed and irregular income groups to have their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups

            <p>
                According to BNM's Financial Stability Review report for the second half of 2022, the vast majority, more than 80%, of banks in Malaysia would be able to maintain capital ratios above their internal capital targets, although 24 out of 54 banks, with a cumulative share of 25% of total banking system assets, would report losses in at least one year throughout the three-year stress horizon

            <p>
                However, the central bank noted that two banks, which account for less than 1% of total banking system assets, are projected to breach the minimum regulatory capital requirements under these adverse scenarios
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, in AS2 in which a prolonged slowdown is assumed, the total capital ratio will fall lower in a gradual manner

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 — A group of contract medical officers (MO) with the Ministry of Health that involves around 8,000 doctors has threatened mass resignation and a nationwide strike beginning next week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A spokesperson from the group who declined to be named told the English daily that they decided to proceed with the strike peacefully by taking emergency leave or medical leave “because demonstrations or walkouts will cause harm”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have confirmed that an estimated 8,000 out of some 20,000 contract medical officers will participate in this strike or mass resignation event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “(Some) 3,000 contract MOs will resign on April 1, while the rest will not be present to work from April 3-5,” the representative told The Star
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah told the news outlet that he was only aware of the alleged strike through social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that a strike or mass resignation is not the best way to solve issues in the medical field

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 — A group of contract medical officers (MO) with the Ministry of Health that involves around 8,000 doctors has threatened mass resignation and a nationwide strike beginning next week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A spokesperson from the group who declined to be named told the English daily that they decided to proceed with the strike peacefully by taking emergency leave or medical leave “because demonstrations or walkouts will cause harm”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have confirmed that an estimated 8,000 out of some 20,000 contract medical officers will participate in this strike or mass resignation event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “(Some) 3,000 contract MOs will resign on April 1, while the rest will not be present to work from April 3-5,” the representative told The Star
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah told the news outlet that he was only aware of the alleged strike through social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that a strike or mass resignation is not the best way to solve issues in the medical field

                Senegal, who won the tournament in Cameroon some 14 months ago, beat Mozambique 1-0 away to keep up their 100% record and secure top spot in Group L while a point away for Burkina Faso at Togo in a 1-1 draw was enough for them to progress from Group B

            <p>
                The Tottenham right-back tried to let the ball go out but Andy Robertson nipped in to cut the ball back for McTominay, who fired the ball home like a..

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the game against Hong Kong, Winger Akhyar got his second consecutive international goal when he finished off a clever pass from fellow winger Faisal Halim in the 18th minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the two goals, Malaysia looked lacklustre in the first-half, as some players were making wayward and loose passes, and Hong Kong dominated that half but was unlucky upfront
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The players were brought into the match to make sure Malaysia maintained its lead and ended the match with a win.

                Is Social Security Taxed? Yes, there's a good chance you'll pay taxes on your Social Security benefits, so it's essential to first understand how Social Security is taxed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How to Lower Your Taxes on Social Security Here are some simple strategies that will potentially help you lower your Social Security tax bill, and in turn, your marginal tax rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With lower RMDs, or none at all, your combined income will be lower, lessening your Social Security tax liability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This problem can lead a retiree in the 22% federal income tax bracket to pay a marginal tax rate as high as 40.7%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Roth conversions and other nontaxable income sources can help lower your Social Security tax liability, and in turn, your marginal tax rate
            </p>

                Is Social Security Taxed? Yes, there's a good chance you'll pay taxes on your Social Security benefits, so it's essential to first understand how Social Security is taxed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How to Lower Your Taxes on Social Security Here are some simple strategies that will potentially help you lower your Social Security tax bill, and in turn, your marginal tax rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With lower RMDs, or none at all, your combined income will be lower, lessening your Social Security tax liability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This problem can lead a retiree in the 22% federal income tax bracket to pay a marginal tax rate as high as 40.7%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Roth conversions and other nontaxable income sources can help lower your Social Security tax liability, and in turn, your marginal tax rate
            </p>

                While the new model was generally based on Geely Haoyue or Geely Okavango as what it is known in markets outside of China, it goes without saying that the X90 has been given some design tweaks to make it…well, a Proton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In fact, Proton noted that the new diamond shapes on the grille were actually inspired by songket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the new X90 is also the company’s first-ever hybrid model which was made possible by the inclusion of the 48V Electric Motor Synergy (EMS) System that is able to produce an additional power boost of 13PS and 45Nm of torque
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hybrid powertrain is the reason why the new Proton X90 will mark a new era for the national automaker as it is the company’s first foray into the New Energy Vehicle (NEV)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aside from confirming the name of the new model and the basic details of its hybrid power unit, Proton has also revealed that the X90 will be made available in four variants from Standard to Flagship which is rather similar to the existing arrangement made for X50
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 — Deputy Dewan Rakyat Speaker Datuk Ramli Mohd Nor has rejected the emergency motion by Perikatan Nasional’s (PN) Machang MP Wan Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal to debate Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s recent trip to Saudi Arabia

                At the end of Ministers’ Question Time (MQT) in Parliament today, Ramli said that government affairs were the priority in the Dewan Rakyat, whose order of business was determined by the Speaker Datuk Johari Abdul and Leader of the House, who is Anwar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We should know that the Leader of the House is the prime minister, that is indisputable

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 — Deputy Dewan Rakyat Speaker Datuk Ramli Mohd Nor has rejected the emergency motion by Perikatan Nasional’s (PN) Machang MP Wan Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal to debate Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s recent trip to Saudi Arabia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the end of Ministers’ Question Time (MQT) in Parliament today, Ramli said that government affairs were the priority in the Dewan Rakyat, whose order of business was determined by the Speaker Datuk Johari Abdul and Leader of the House, who is Anwar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We should know that the Leader of the House is the prime minister, that is indisputable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Order of the Day is decided by Parliament, which is under the auspices of the Speaker and the Leader of the House
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Government affairs take precedence,” he told Parliament today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, it was reported that Wan Fayhsal had filed an emergency motion to discuss Anwar’s recent trip to Saudi Arabia in the Dewan Rakyat

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 — The Inland Revenue Board's (LHDN) decision to end tax relief for National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) depositors will pose a huge financial impact on the middle-income families, Muar MP Syed Saddiq Abdul Rahman said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysia United Democratic Alliance (Muda) president said that without the tax relief, parents from the income group will have less incentive to kickstart an education fund for their children

                The world's largest food group was a client of Credit Suisse, Schneider told broadcaster TeleZueri in an interview to be shown on Tuesday evening, and had been following the collapse of Switzerland's second-biggest bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We have worked closely with Credit Suisse for many decades in a spirit of trust," Schneider told the broadcaster
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking about Nestle, Schneider said the company had made a good start to 2023, although further price rises by the company were likely, Schneider said, to offset inflation of raw material costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Price increases had so far only had a "very limited" impact on consumer spending, Schneider said

                "As inflation continues, and then also affects our own profitability, we will have to adjust prices," Schneider said

                The man was charged with keeping the animals in captivity and causing them unnecessary suffering which ended with their carcasses found in a condominium unit in Bandar Seri Permaisuri, between June 14 and July 3 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the facts of the case, on March 11, the complainant who is the house owner, received a complaint from a nearby resident of a stench coming from the unit that he was renting to the accused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On checking the house, he found several cat carcasses in a cage placed outside the door
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The complainant advised the accused to remove the cage so that there would be no more complaints from residents of the condominium
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the help of a security guard, the complainant inspected the house and found a carcass believed to be that of a cat and detected a foul smell in the kitchen, which came from a pail filled with minced meat

                The man was charged with keeping the animals in captivity and causing them unnecessary suffering which ended with their carcasses found in a condominium unit in Bandar Seri Permaisuri, between June 14 and July 3 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the facts of the case, on March 11, the complainant who is the house owner, received a complaint from a nearby resident of a stench coming from the unit that he was renting to the accused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On checking the house, he found several cat carcasses in a cage placed outside the door
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The complainant advised the accused to remove the cage so that there would be no more complaints from residents of the condominium
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the help of a security guard, the complainant inspected the house and found a carcass believed to be that of a cat and detected a foul smell in the kitchen, which came from a pail filled with minced meat

                Manchester United defender Victor Lindelöf ‘received treatment’ after Sweden’s 5-0 victor over Azerbaijan on Wednesday, according to Aftonbladet
            </p>

                After the tie, the Manchester United centre-back spoke to reporters in the mixed zone and explained his issue
            </p>

                “It was with the national team in September

            <p>
                It didn’t stop him from featuring for Manchester United in their defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad on October 2nd

                It also reported that if the Bills are passed, more than 1,300 people currently on death row can seek a review of their sentence by the federal court.  Ms Azalina said that death row inmates will be able to file an application for a review of their sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the courts may choose to extend the 90-day time frame subject to reasonable grounds.  Ms Azalina also noted that through the proposed laws, the federal court will be given the jurisdiction to review the cases of 840 death row inmates including 25 others whose pardon appeals were rejected by the Pardons Board
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A total of 476 death row inmates, who have yet to exhaust their appeal process in court, will also be covered by the law,” she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are currently 11 offences that carry the mandatory death penalty, including murder, drug trafficking, terrorism, kidnapping and possession of firearms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last June, the Malaysian government announced its decision to abolish the mandatory death penalty as part of its commitment at the international level to refrain from imposing capital punishment.  “We are of the view that everyone deserves a second chance,” said former prime minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob, according to Bernama.

                Margma expects global glove demand to hit 300 billion pieces this year, up from 280 billion pieces in 2018 and 340 billion pieces in 2019

            <p>
                The research firm noted challenges remain for glove makers in the near term, as the excess supply of gloves in the market continues to affect the industry’s average selling price (ASP), followed by persisting low utilisation rates

                MIDF Research, in a report, noted the utilisation rate fell from 35% to 40% in the fourth quarter of 2022 (4Q22) to 32% to 35% in 1Q23, which was barely half of the rate in 2019

                Moving forward, MIDF Research believes the raw material prices will stay high due to decreased NR latex concentrate production during the winter season until May 2023, as well as increased demand for butadiene and acrylonitrile

                In a statement on Monday (March 27), the firm said the bulk of these US$5 billion (RM22 billion) opportunities in Southeast Asia are in Indonesia, where upwards of US$2 billion of assets are on the market, followed by Malaysia and Vietnam which have approximately US$1.4 billion and US$1 billion for sale respectively

                At the Court of Appeal here yesterday, a three-judge panel chaired by Justice Hanipah Farikullah allowed Ahmad Zahid’s application to review the High Court’s decision on Feb 3 that dismissed his request to keep his personal and diplomatic passports with him permanently

            <p>

                On Feb 3, Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah (now a Court of Appeal judge) only allowed Ahmad Zahid temporary access to his passport in order for the Bagan Datuk MP to have his diplomatic passport made

            <p>
                On Jan 20, Ahmad Zahid filed the application for permanent release of his passport, which he said was done bona fide (with good intentions) so he could perform his official duties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said he needed the passport back as he was required to travel out of the country as part of this duty and it would also help him apply for a diplomatic passport for official travel.

                The reason why it would fall short? Because of a TikTok data centre within its region

            <p>
                According to Morten Brandtzæg, Nammo’s chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times (paywall), the heavy arms and ammo production company says that the reason it believes it will fall short of its demand quota is because a TikTok datacentre in the region, is said to be hogging all of the electricity within the area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is another extenuating factor which Brandtzæg isn’t fully addressing, but isn’t pushing to the side either, and that is whether China currently has had a hand in influencing ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to undermine Nammo’s production capabilities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I will not rule out that it’s not by pure coincidence that this activity is close to a defense company,” Brandtzæg said

                When you need another stream of income for retirement, you might consider an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before buying an annuity, it’s important to consider how much monthly income it might generate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How Much Does a $300,000 Annuity Pay Per Month? How much a $300,000 annuity pays per month largely depends on when you purchase the annuity, how annuity funds are invested and how much time it has to grow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Using an annuity calculator can help you estimate how much money a $300,000 annuity (or an annuity in any other amount) may generate in monthly income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you have a specific monthly income need that you would like an annuity to meet, you might have to adjust the annuity amount to produce that level of income for yourself and your spouse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How Much Monthly Income Can I Expect From an Annuity? The amount of monthly income an annuity generates depends largely on the type of annuity, its face value and how much interest the annuity earns

            <p>
                When you need another stream of income for retirement, you might consider an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before buying an annuity, it’s important to consider how much monthly income it might generate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How Much Does a $300,000 Annuity Pay Per Month? How much a $300,000 annuity pays per month largely depends on when you purchase the annuity, how annuity funds are invested and how much time it has to grow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Using an annuity calculator can help you estimate how much money a $300,000 annuity (or an annuity in any other amount) may generate in monthly income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you have a specific monthly income need that you would like an annuity to meet, you might have to adjust the annuity amount to produce that level of income for yourself and your spouse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How Much Monthly Income Can I Expect From an Annuity? The amount of monthly income an annuity generates depends largely on the type of annuity, its face value and how much interest the annuity earns
            </p>

            <p>
                Ma has kept a low profile since late 2020, when a speech he made attacking Chinese regulators was followed by Beijing pulling Alibaba affiliate Ant Group’s planned IPO

            <p>
                Ant Group said in January Ma had ceded control of the fintech company, adjusting its ownership structure so that “no shareholder, alone or jointly with other parties, will have control over Ant Group”

                According to a police press release, one such scam variant involved scammers pretending to sell jade on TikTok livestreams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second type of scam variant involved “investment” in raw jade stones over TikTok
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Interested parties would be instructed to transfer money to the scammers’ bank accounts in advance, after whic scammers would cut a piece of raw jade stone to determine its value on the TikTok livestream
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The returns on investment would be dependent on the value of the cut jade stones

                According to a police press release, one such scam variant involved scammers pretending to sell jade on TikTok livestreams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second type of scam variant involved “investment” in raw jade stones over TikTok
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Interested parties would be instructed to transfer money to the scammers’ bank accounts in advance, after whic scammers would cut a piece of raw jade stone to determine its value on the TikTok livestream
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The returns on investment would be dependent on the value of the cut jade stones
            </p>

                About Us Advertise PHNOM PENH, March 27 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has expressed appreciation to his Cambodian counterpart Hun Sen for the latter’s support in bringing back Malaysian victims of a job scam syndicate in Cambodia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, who is on a one-day official visit to Cambodia, described Hun Sen’s leadership as ‘outstanding’ in giving full support and collaboration in resolving the job scam issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also expressed his trust in the wisdom of his Cambodian counterpart because Hun Sen had managed to secure peace when faced with a more complex situation in Cambodia as compared to the current crisis in Myanmar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also expressed his gratitude to Hun Sen for organising a breaking of fast with thousands of Muslims in Cambodia tonight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said this was a reflection of Hun Sen’s understanding of tolerance and respect for minority groups, a trait which Anwar said the world lacks for now

            <p>
                In the May 24, 2021 incident, a train ferrying 213 passengers collided with a faulty train which was being test-driven (autonomously) in a tunnel between the Kampung Baru and KLCC stations

            <p>
                Former Pasir Salak MP Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman, who was Prasarana chairman at the time, faced heavy criticism for his lack of empathy, lack of professionalism and remarks made during a press conference following the crash

                In his statement of claim, Lim said the former prime minister had defamed him in Facebook posts after being released on bail by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission on March 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim, who was finance minister from 2018 to 2020 during the Pakatan Harapan administration, claimed that Muhyiddin's statement also implied that he had cancelled the approved tax exemption status given to Yayasan Al-Bukhary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "His (Muhyiddin) statement implies that I misused my authority and ordered the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN) to impose taxes and penalties on a welfare foundation, which isn't the case," Lim's statement of claim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim is also seeking an apology and retraction of the allegedly defamatory statements published on Muhyiddin's Facebook and Twitter accounts, which were published across major newspapers and portals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 21, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim confirmed in Parliament that Lim did not revoke the foundation's tax exempt status, which was contrary to Muhyiddin's claims.

                Alibaba shares in Hong Kong rose more than 4% after the SCMP report was published
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The SCMP report did not state when Ma had returned to China but said, citing sources, that he visited a school he founded in the city of Hangzhou, the home of Alibaba and financial technology firm Ant Group
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that he returned to China after a brief stop in Hong Kong

                “It is true that the Malays became so poor after I was no longer prime minister,” Dr Mahathir wrote in a Facebook post on Monday (Mar 27)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir, 97, claimed that he had tried to improve the state of the Malays in the country when he became prime minister for the second time following the 14th General Elections in May 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That's why I'm complaining now,” Dr Mahathir said in the post to refute allegations made by current Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir on Monday demanded that Mr Anwar furnish the proof of his allegations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir also accused the current government under Mr Anwar of rejecting the country’s Constitution after a pro-Malay gathering was called off.  A Malay rights event had been set to take place on Mar 19 in Kuala Lumpur, with Dr Mahathir in attendance as the guest of honour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is why the Malays should be concerned about the government led by Anwar Ibrahim,” said Dr Mahathir

                Dr Mahathir, 97, claimed that he had tried to improve the state of the Malays in the country when he became prime minister for the second time following the 14th General Elections in May 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That's why I'm complaining now,” Dr Mahathir said in the post to refute allegations made by current Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir on Monday demanded that Mr Anwar furnish the proof of his allegations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir also accused the current government under Mr Anwar of rejecting the country’s Constitution after a pro-Malay gathering was called off.  A Malay rights event had been set to take place on Mar 19 in Kuala Lumpur, with Dr Mahathir in attendance as the guest of honour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is why the Malays should be concerned about the government led by Anwar Ibrahim,” said Dr Mahathir

                Man Utd are looking to sign a creative midfielder this summer and could offer Marcel Sabitzer a permanent role

            <p>
                The demand for chicken is expected to increase due to the upcoming Hari Raya Puasa festive period, celebrated by Muslims who make up the majority in Malaysia.  Separately, the Terengganu Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living said that there has been a drop of up to 33 per cent in the supply of eggs in the state during Ramadan due to a shortage from out-of-state suppliers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is due to the increasing demand for eggs during Ramadan and the farms prioritise their own local market first.”  In June last year, a month after Hari Raya Puasa, Malaysia was forced to implement temporary export restrictions on chicken to address the domestic chicken supply shortage which had also driven up the prices of chicken.  The export ban was partially lifted in October for live broiler chickens

            <p>
                Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God), now the supply of chicken and eggs is beginning to recover and will be stable again soon,” he said, adding that it was a “commendable achievement”.

                About Us Advertise LUXEMBOURG, March 27 — Cristiano Ronaldo continued his record-breaking form for Portugal as he grabbed two more goals in his country’s 6-0 thrashing of Luxembourg in a Euro 2024 qualifier on Sunday, giving them a second win in four days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joao Felix, Bernando Silva, Otavio and Rafael Leao added the other goals to put Portugal top of Group J after an easy start to their qualifying campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joao Felix doubled the lead in the 15th minute, rising high to get onto the end of Silva’s cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Silva then himself headed home a powerful effort three minutes later after being set up by Joao Palhinha
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Luxembourg looked bedraggled in the first half but offered more resistance after the break before Rafael Leao’s looping cross allowed fellow substitute Otavio to head home Portugal’s fifth

                All these only scare away foreign investors,” he pointed out

            <p>
                In January, the government announced the Foreign Worker Employment Relaxation Plan (PKPPA) for five critical sectors – from Jan 17 to March 31 – to address the urgent workforce shortage issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many foreign workers have been approved but their arrivals are not so fast ..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Since it is not cost-effective to retain foreign workers when demand is low, the (increased) quota and approvals for foreign workers must be given when businesses need it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So we hope the government gives it a case-by-case review.”

                Liverpool are ‘hovering’ for Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot as they look to get to the Frenchman before Man Utd, according to a report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rabiot is enjoying an excellent season with Juve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool will probably find it easier to agree a contract with Rabiot than Man Utd due to his existing love for the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They reveal that Liverpool are ‘hovering’ for Rabiot’s signature and could soon begin discussions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report urges Man Utd and Juve to ‘watch out for Liverpool’ as they are monitoring Rabiot closely
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But they know they will struggle to meet his demands and the money being offered by Liverpool or Man Utd

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, March 27 — Economy minister Rafizi Ramli expressed confidence today Malaysia would be able to achieve an inflation rate of 3.3 per cent after Malaysia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February remained unchanged at 129.8 or 3.7 per cent

                “There are signs showing we have surpassed peak inflation (as seen in September 2022) and we now have a chance to bring our inflation to between 3.1 to 3.3 per cent by year-end if the current trend continues

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gamuda's wholly owned Gamuda Land (Labuan) Ltd holds a 75% stake in VB II, while Castleforge’s wholly-owned partnership entity Athelstan Ltd owns the remaining 25%

                The acquisition is part of its property development arm Gamuda Land’s quick-turnaround-project (QTP) strategy, which aims to build a regional portfolio of real estate projects with high internal rates of return with investment time frames of five years or less, Gamuda's filing showed

                Protestors demonstrate in front of 'Landungsbruecken' at the harbour during a nationwide strike called by the German trade union Verdi over a wage dispute in Hamburg, Germany, March 27, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Verdi is demanding a 10.5% wage increase, which would see pay rising by at least 500 euros per month, while EVG is asking for a 12% raise or at least 650 euros per month

                The walkout is the biggest in Germany, which has a long history of collective wage bargaining, since 1992, according to Verdi

                In the meantime, Loke who is also the Minister of Transport, said the target set is to defend the 16 state seats held by DAP in Selangor as a key performance indicator (KPI) for the formation of a mature and stable state government

                “So in Selangor, DAP must play a role as a party that provides opportunities to young people so that talents can be unearthed to keep the party’s leadership and machinery strong because many young leaders in DAP today started out in Selangor,” he said

                That would make Manchester United -- who have not won the Premier League for a decade -- the most expensive sports club in history, although it would be short of the £6 billion valuation reportedly placed on United by its current US-based owners, the Glazer family

                Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe, the founder of chemicals giant INEOS, remain the front runners to buy United should the Glazers give up control of the club

            <p>
                Zilliacus entered the race on Thursday, with a bid he said will give fans the chance to own 50 percent of the club

            <p>
                - 'Stupid prices' - Sheikh Jassim is bidding for 100 percent control, aiming to return the club to its "former glories"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A source close to Sheikh Jassim's bid had earlier told AFP he remains confident his bid is "the best for the club, fans and local community"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ratcliffe, who already owns French club Nice, said his interest in United would be "purely in winning things", calling the club a "community asset"

                That would make Manchester United -- who have not won the Premier League for a decade -- the most expensive sports club in history, although it would be short of the £6 billion valuation reportedly placed on United by its current US-based owners, the Glazer family

            <p>
                Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe, the founder of chemicals giant INEOS, remain the front runners to buy United should the Glazers give up control of the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zilliacus entered the race on Thursday, with a bid he said will give fans the chance to own 50 percent of the club

                - 'Stupid prices' - Sheikh Jassim is bidding for 100 percent control, aiming to return the club to its "former glories"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A source close to Sheikh Jassim's bid had earlier told AFP he remains confident his bid is "the best for the club, fans and local community"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ratcliffe, who already owns French club Nice, said his interest in United would be "purely in winning things", calling the club a "community asset"

                IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva reiterated her view that 2023 would be another challenging year

            <p>
                "Uncertainties are exceptionally high," with the outlook for the global economy likely to remain weak over the medium term, she told the China Development Forum

                The IMF forecasts China's economy to grow 5.2 percent this year, driven by a rebound in private consumption as the country reopens after its pandemic isolation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The robust rebound means China is set to account for around one third of global growth in 2023 -- giving a welcome lift to the world economy," she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "A 1.0 percentage point increase in GDP growth in China leads to 0.3 percentage point increase in growth in other Asian economies, on average -- a welcome boost." Georgieva urged China's policymakers to seek to raise productivity and rebalance the economy away from investment and towards more durable consumption-driven growth

                MMA president Dr Muruga Raj Rajathurai said the nation is still facing a shortage of medical professionals in the public and private sectors, with an ageing population expected in 2030

            <p>

                The sellers will make an attempt to pull the price below the 20-day EMA, and if successful, BNB could experience a drop to $300 and potentially to the 200-day SMA ($289)

                China said its foreign minister, Qin Gang, and Honduran Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina signed the deal on diplomatic recognition in Beijing, ending relations with Taiwan dating back to the 1940s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a brief statement late on Saturday, the Honduran foreign ministry said it recognised the People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate government that represents all of China and that Taiwan is an “inseparable part of Chinese territory”

                Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, in a video statement, said Taiwan will not compete with China in “meaningless” dollar diplomacy

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 —The Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah today said there is nothing to stop Muslims from visiting other places of worship

            <p>
                Sultan Sharafuddin shared a story where his late grandfather Sultan Alam Shah who was an attendee at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, had asked the state Mufti if he could participate in the event
            </p>

            <p>
                Sultan Sharafuddin also commented on the recent Selangor Islamic Religious Council (Mais) claims that activities, where Muslims visit non-Muslim houses of worship such as temples, churches, and gurdwaras to learn about these religions apart from their own, should be rejected and restricted
