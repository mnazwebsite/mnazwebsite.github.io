            <p>
                Klang Selatan district police chief ACP Cha Hoong Fong said all the suspects who wore masks and gloves and are believed to have entered the two-storey terraced house through the rear door where they parked their vehicle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Several suspects also hit a 45-year-old female victim on her nose and body before knocking her on the head with the back of a machete,” he said in a statement today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Cha, the police received information about the getaway vehicle found in a residential alley in Taman Desawan, Klang, however, when the police arrived at the location, all the suspects had fled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The police are still tracking down the suspects involved, so those who have information about this incident are urged to contact Klang Selatan district police headquarters at 03-33762222 or any nearby police station," he added

                Express Sport looks at how Liverpool could line up at St James’ Park
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp’s first change will come in defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though Joe Gomez and Joel Matip kept a clean sheet against Everton earlier in the week, Van Dijk is fit again after a hamstring injury and is expected to start on Tyneside
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson should start in the full-back positions although Kostas Tsimikas has started just one of Liverpool’s last 11 league games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Captain Jordan Henderson was a driving force for Liverpool against Everton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But with the Champions League visit of Real Madrid a third match in eight days next Tuesday, Henderson could drop back to the bench here to keep him fresh

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb18 — Singapore has recorded its first Covid-19 vaccine-related death after the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced yesterday that a 28-year-old Bangladeshi man likely died due to a vaccination against the coronavirus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The coroner also found that on the balance of probabilities, it was “likely to be related to Covid-19 vaccination”, MOH said without naming the deceased
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the ministry’s Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme, a one-time financial aid of S$225,000 (RM 745,793.13) will be extended to the man’s family
            </p>

                “MOH is working with the Ministry of Manpower to extend assistance to his family and facilitate their application,” MOH added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also said that to date, more than 17 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in Singapore through the national vaccination programme and this is “the first death related to Covid-19 vaccination locally”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This will enable early diagnosis and appropriate medical management of any rare severe adverse events that may occur after vaccination.” MOH said that along with the expert committee on Covid-19 vaccination and HSA, it will continue to monitor vaccine-related serious adverse events closely

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 18 — The Cabinet has agreed to amend the Federal Constitution to enable children born abroad to Malaysian mothers to gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Federal Constitution currently only provides automatic citizenship for children born overseas to Malaysian fathers, while Malaysian mothers are required to apply for their overseas-born children to be registered as Malaysian citizens with no guarantee of success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The only difference for such overseas-born children is whether their Malaysian parent is a father or mother
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 18 — The Cabinet has agreed to amend the Federal Constitution to enable children born abroad to Malaysian mothers to gain automatic Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Federal Constitution currently only provides automatic citizenship for children born overseas to Malaysian fathers, while Malaysian mothers are required to apply for their overseas-born children to be registered as Malaysian citizens with no guarantee of success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The only difference for such overseas-born children is whether their Malaysian parent is a father or mother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is despite an amendment to Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution in September 2001 to stop gender discrimination

                Ras Adiba said that autism can be identified at the early stages of a child’s development by their own parents and is usually diagnosed around the ages of 1 to 3, and being quite significant as children reach the age of six

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb 18 — Google Singapore yesterday confirmed that it has laid off an unspecified number of employees at its Singapore office, a day after the global technology giant’s India office retrenched more than 450 staff members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In response to queries from TODAY, Google Singapore said that the firm is “unable to share the number of employees impacted in Singapore”, but said that the workers are “part of the 12,000 roles affected globally as previously announced”

            <p>
                Checks by TODAY on professional networking site LinkedIn showed that several laid-off and retained Google Singapore staff members had made mention of the retrenchment exercise

                About Us Advertise LONDON, Feb 18 — The US partner of global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has confirmed that a trading firm managed by Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng operated as a market maker on its platform
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters reported on Thursday, citing banking records and company messages, that Binance had secret access to a bank account belonging to its purportedly independent US partner and transferred large sums of money from the account to the trading firm, Merit Peak Ltd “While there was a market making firm named Merit Peak that operated on the Binance.US platform, it stopped all activity on the platform in 2021,” Binance.US said in a tweet on Thursday after the Reuters story was published
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The global Binance exchange is not licensed to operate in the United States but the transfers to Merit Peak revealed by Reuters suggest that Binance controlled the finances of Binance.US, despite saying publicly that the American entity is “fully independent” and operates as its “US partner.” Binance transferred over US$400 million from the account at California-based Silvergate Bank to Merit Peak between January and March of 2021, Reuters reported on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before that story’s publication, Binance.US had told Reuters that “Merit Peak is neither trading nor providing any kind of services on the Binance.US platform,” without giving further details
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A spokesperson for the global Binance exchange, which did not respond to Reuters’ questions for the story on Thursday, told crypto news outlet CoinDesk that the transfers were “a Binance.US issue.” Zhao, the Binance CEO, said yesterday that the global exchange has pulled back on potential investments in the United States, a move that comes amid growing scrutiny by US regulators of crypto companies so far this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They fell sharply on the Reuters report on Thursday, losing more than 22 per cent

                Gabriel Martinelli is on a barren run, Eddie Nketiah was profligate in front of goal against Manchester City and the midfield appears imbalanced without Thomas Partey

                Football is fickle though and Arsenal have been excellent this season; the current run is unlikely to continue

                Arsenal haven't made as many as they usually would

City are odds-on favourites to win their fifth crown in six years but Guardiola is convinced they have a fight on their hands.  'Momentum is when you win 10 in a row and we have not done that this season,' he said

                If it doesn't, I am overthinking, arrogant,' said the City manager, whose side are top on goal difference after beating Arsenal 3-1

City are odds-on favourites to win their fifth crown in six years but Guardiola is convinced they have a fight on their hands.  'Momentum is when you win 10 in a row and we have not done that this season,' he said

                In his notice of motion filed on Feb 13, Ahmad Zahid said the High Court’s dismissal would prejudice his rights and responsibilities as he would have to officially apply to get access to his passport each time he needed to leave the country for official work

                Something is very wrong with the stock market, according to a top strategist at JPMorgan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Marko Kolanovic, chief market strategist and cohead of global research at the Wall Street bank, fears retail traders have failed to heed flashing red signals from the bond market in a mistaken belief that inflation has already been defeated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Over 20% of all market volume [is] coming from retail orders,” wrote Kolanovic in a note to clients on Wednesday, adding that this was nearing a record high
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With investors no longer chasing yield in the stock market, the Nasdaq should therefore be in the process of correcting, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                High beta names like Tesla and MicroStrategy that offer greater risk and returns than the underlying stock market have also doubled in value over the past six weeks
            </p>

                Something is very wrong with the stock market, according to a top strategist at JPMorgan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Marko Kolanovic, chief market strategist and cohead of global research at the Wall Street bank, fears retail traders have failed to heed flashing red signals from the bond market in a mistaken belief that inflation has already been defeated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Over 20% of all market volume [is] coming from retail orders,” wrote Kolanovic in a note to clients on Wednesday, adding that this was nearing a record high
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With investors no longer chasing yield in the stock market, the Nasdaq should therefore be in the process of correcting, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                High beta names like Tesla and MicroStrategy that offer greater risk and returns than the underlying stock market have also doubled in value over the past six weeks

                A United States Air Force F-35 fighter jet taxis during the Aero India 2023 air show at Yelahanka air base in Bengaluru on Feb 13, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                India, desperate to modernise its largely Soviet-era fighter jet fleet to boost its air power, is concerned about Russian supply delays due to the Ukraine war and has faced pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The American delegation to the week-long Aero India show in Bengaluru, which ends on Friday (Feb 17), is the biggest in the 27-year history of the show and underlines the growing strategic relationship between the United States and India
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At previous editions of the show, Rosoboronexport had a more central position for its stall, although Russia has not brought a fighter jet to Bengaluru for a decade after India began considering more European and US fighter jets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The F-35 is not being considered by India "as of now", according to an Indian Air Force (IAF) source, but the display of two F-35s at Aero India for the first time was a sign of New Delhi's growing strategic importance to Washington
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked if it would be offered to India, Rear Admiral Michael L Baker, defence attache at the US embassy in India, said that New Delhi was in the "very early stages" of considering whether it wanted the plane

                Available in three different plans, only two of them are available for the time being including the UNI5G Postpaid 39 and UNI5G Postpaid 65

            <p>
                On the other hand, the UNI5G Postpaid 65 is priced at RM65 per month and has a data quota of 60GB

            <p>
                They come with no contract as well with the exception of UNI5G Postpaid 89 which has a 24-month contract although this only applies if the customer chooses to pick up a 5G device together with the plan

                Prior to the revamp, Unifi Mobile customers are able to utilise unlimited data, voice calls, and SMS with 5G support via the Ultimate Plan which was priced at RM79 per month

                The plan can also be obtained at a slightly lower price of RM59 per month if you choose to obtain it with a 12-month contract

                Azalina pointed out that the Sulu heirs' bid to seize Malaysia's assets is based on the alleged arbitration award by Gonzalo Stampa --- whose appointment as arbitrator has been cancelled by the same court which appointed him initially
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if such a second seizure order does exist, Azalina said Malaysia will fight off such bids in the courts

            <p>
                On January 24 this year, the District Court of Luxembourg decided to lift or set aside a seizure order on two Petronas subsidiaries and their assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seizure order was previously issued last July 11 upon request of the alleged Sulu heirs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 30, Azalina said Malaysia is also currently challenging an ex parte Exequatur Order — or a May 18, 2022 order which recognised Stampa's purported arbitration award in Luxembourg — before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia continues to dispute the appointment of Stampa as arbitrator and also challenges the entire arbitration process and his award in favour of the Sulu claimants as invalid and illegal

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Compared to the same month in 2022, however, January’s total was 19.1% (or 7,928 units) higher than the 41,533 units achieved last year, where production cycles were still recovering from the disruption caused by floods that hit Shah Alam at the end of 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite it being a shorter calendar month, the association projects that sales in February will be higher than January levels due to a full working month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Comments The production minus sales =approx 9000 units.This is not counting Dec 2022 unsold stocks The MAA members are blaming chips again..which is just an excuse for sales drop.U can see many  MAA dealers still advertising 2022 models for sale now

                His body is still in England, but a funeral was held to lead his soul back to his hometown in Chiang Rai’s Mae Sai district, said Phra Kru Prayut Chetiyanukarn, the abbot who performed funeral rites using Dom’s photos, clothes and shoes

                “On Tuesday morning, Duangpetch remained in critical condition before he died at 1.43pm (local time),” the embassy said, adding that its staff are working with the hospital, Brooke House College and Thailand’s non-profit Zico Foundation, which secured the scholarship for Dom, to return his body to Thailand

                Thanks to Erik ten Hag's tactics, Manchester United scored twice in seven second-half minutes to stun Barcelona and set up an intriguing second leg in the Europa League  Manchester United arrived in Barcelona hindered by injuries to play an in-form side in a stadium they had never beaten them in before
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Marcos Alonso’s back-post header from a corner put the home side in front before United sprung into life

            <p>
                Despite his annoyance at not getting more, it was an impressive night for United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What was more interesting was what Ten Hag did at the other end of the pitch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move was a direct counter to Xavi, who played centre-back Ronald Araujo at right-back in an attempt to nullify the on-fire Rashford

                The model, which provides data and graphic predictions on major variables in renewable energy supply, such as wind speed and solar radiation, as well as demand-side data such as average local temperature, was first issued on Thursday and will be released monthly, the government statement said

            <p>
                China's electric grid system has faced challenges as peak demand spikes during abnormally cold or hot weather have exceeded local power supplies, leading to power outages

            <p>
                China has said it aims for renewable power to account for more than 50 per cent of its electricity generation capacity by 2025

                The judge questioned whether prosecutors’ proposal to largely ban Bankman-Fried’s internet use went far enough, citing the risk he could use his parents’ unmonitored devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are professors at Stanford Law School
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the prosecutors, Nicolas Roos, acknowledged that the government was not monitoring other devices in the home, but said having Bankman-Fried stay there was “a check against some other risks — risks that come from being unmonitored and by yourself.” The hearing came after prosecutors asked Kaplan to ban Bankman-Fried from using the internet except to review evidence against him or use email on his Gmail account, citing his use of a virtual private network (VPN) that could have let him hide some online activity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried’s communications became an issue when prosecutors said he sought to contact FTX’s current chief executive John Ray, and an in-house lawyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They also said Bankman-Fried’s recent use of a VPN was benign — to watch National Football League playoff games on a subscription he had bought while living in the Bahamas

            <p>
                Bankman-Fried has acknowledged inadequate risk management, but said he did not steal any funds

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 — The proposal to make it compulsory to pay allowances to students who undergo industrial training in the private sector will discourage employers from offering places for internship, said the Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement today, MEF president Datuk Syed Hussain Syed Husman said instead of compelling employers to pay internship allowance, the government should consider giving more incentives to the employers to take in more interns and make it mandatory for all undergraduates to undergo internship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “MEF is of the view that employers should pay internship allowance at their discretion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is advisable for employers that take interns to pay some allowance to the interns, and employers taking in interns need to take into consideration rising costs of living faced by the interns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, private companies that take in interns to undergo industrial training pay allowances at their discretion, with the average allowance in bigger cities for an intern being about RM1,200, but some are paid less than RM1,000 per month

                To address the weaknesses, the report recommended that the Federal Territories Ministry and Putrajaya Corporation review the development plan to be in line with any changes to the development concept of Putrajaya, so that suitable infrastructure can be provided

                Yeo said about four years ago, the then-Pakatan Harapan government imposed a pre-condition for Lynas' licence renewal to remove its radioactive waste from Malaysia according to its two letters of undertaking to the government in 2012
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "However, we refused to see a never-ending accumulation of radioactive waste in Malaysia hence replaced the condition on removing all radioactive waste from Malaysia with removing the radioactive material-producing process (cracking and leaching) from Malaysia within four years," she said in a statement Friday (Feb 17)

            <p>
                Under the new condition, Yeo said Lynas had four years to build a cracking and leaching facility elsewhere and upon its completion, Lynas would no longer be allowed to produce radioactive waste in Malaysia and only the intermediates would be allowed to be shipped here for further processing

                She said that in other words, Lynas could fund the entire facility with just one year of profit while still enjoying its 12-year tax exemption

                In its Annual Economic Statistic 2021, DOSM said the manufacturing sector remains a primary contributor with a 50.1 per cent share, or RM1.61 trillion, of the value of gross output and a 17.4 per cent annual percentage change
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, DOSM said intermediate input for the overall economic sectors registered a double-digit growth of 12.2 per cent in 2021 to RM1.96 trillion from RM1.75 trillion in the previous year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said the value added for all economic sectors in 2021 grew 8.1 per cent, with an increase of RM93.8 billion to RM1.25 trillion against RM1.16 trillion in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The services sector, with a share of 52.6 per cent, was the prime mover to the economy, with its value-added rebounding 1.7 per cent to RM658.2 billion in 2021 compared to RM647 billion in 2020,” it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DoSM said this was followed by the manufacturing sector with a 14.6 per cent growth with RM355.1 billion value added

                Sin Chew Daily reported 60-year-old businesswoman surnamed Chen said that the security guards in the city council building denied her from using the elevator because of her dress that was deemed ‘too short’ despite the length falling way below her knees

            <p>
                As she proceeded to go to the lift, security guards blocked her path told the businesswoman that her dress length was considered too short and that the skirt length has to touch the floor to be considered appropriate attire for the building

            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the issues highlighted in the report was the payment by the police to a company that did the printing and mailing of police summonses but did not do so according to contract terms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The relevant ministry and police are in discussion with the company about the fine to be paid,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report also found that the Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry had paid RM730,000 under the padi price subsidy scheme to farmers who had died

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 — Pejuang state assemblyman Harumaini Omar has reportedly denied that he was absent from the assembly sittings for six months, after he was thrown out and his Batang Kali seat declared vacant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Selangor state assembly Speaker Ng Suee Lim made the announcement that the Batang Kali seat is now vacant following Haruiman’s absence without leave for more than six months since July 28
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Ng, a by-election will not be called since Harumaini has been holding his seat for more than two years since his term begins in the 2018 Selangor state election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng said the declaration of Harumaini’s Batang Kali seat as vacant was done in accordance with Article LXIX of the 1959 Selangor state constitution, and that he would notify the Election Commission (EC) soon regarding the declaration of vacancy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malay Mail’s check of the Selangor state constitution’s Article LXIX shows the provision stating that the Selangor state assembly Speaker is to declare a state seat as vacant, if that state assemblyman has been absent for more than six months without the Speaker’s leave or permission in each sitting for a period of six months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Harumaini, who first won the Batang Kali state seat in the 2018 Selangor state election, was reported on August 15, 2020 to have quit Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia and expressed support for Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad who had at the time formed a new party called Parti Pejuang Tanah Air.

                MEF president Datuk Dr Syed Hussain Syed Husman (pic) said instead of compelling employers to pay internship allowance, the government should consider giving more incentives to the employers to take in more interns and make it mandatory for all undergraduates to undergo internship

                It is advisable for employers that take interns to pay some allowance to the interns, and employers taking in interns need to take into consideration rising costs of living faced by the interns

                Currently, private companies that take in interns to undergo industrial training pay allowances at their discretion, with the average allowance in bigger cities for an intern being about RM1,200, but some are paid less than RM1,000 per month

                Erik ten Hag has said he is pleased with Manchester United striker Wout Weghorst's makeshift role as a No 10 during their draw at Barcelona Ten Hag described his thought process behind the tactical positioning of Weghorst 'It gave us variation with Jadon and Bruno coming into the half spaces and getting on the ball and the full-backs joining it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'We should have scored in the first half

            <p>
                We created a lot of chances by ourselves
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'We have a lot of character and determination

                The judge questioned whether prosecutors’ proposal to largely ban Bankman-Fried’s internet use went far enough, citing the risk he could use his parents’ unmonitored devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are professors at Stanford Law School
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the prosecutors, Nicolas Roos, acknowledged that the government was not monitoring other devices in the home, but said having Bankman-Fried stay there was “a check against some other risks — risks that come from being unmonitored and by yourself.” The hearing came after prosecutors asked Kaplan to ban Bankman-Fried from using the internet except to review evidence against him or use email on his Gmail account, citing his use of a virtual private network (VPN) that could have let him hide some online activity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried’s communications became an issue when prosecutors said he sought to contact FTX’s current chief executive John Ray, and an in-house lawyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They also said Bankman-Fried’s recent use of a VPN was benign — to watch National Football League playoff games on a subscription he had bought while living in the Bahamas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried has acknowledged inadequate risk management, but said he did not steal any funds

                Arsenal's midweek defeat to Man City has sent a clear message to owner Stan Kroenke about what must be done in the summer transfer window Sign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox We have more newsletters Heading into Wednesday's clash with Man City, there was no doubt that Arsenal deserved to be where they were in the league table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The atmosphere was electric and Arsenal looked up for the challenge just as they have on numerous occasions this season, but Man City highlighted a reoccurring weakness which Stan Kroenke must address in the summer
            </p>

                Mikel Arteta's casualty list grew even further when Thomas Partey was ruled out against City after feeling discomfort in his back and it is not currently known when the Ghanaian will return

            <p>
                With Champions League football currently on course to return to the Emirates Stadium next season, the Arsenal hierarchy will know that the summer window has the potential to be one of their biggest - and most important - yet

                On Wednesday, Arsenal had four defenders on the bench including Rob Holding, whose professionalism has been unquestionable since he joined in 2016

            <p>
                If Arsenal want to do just that and reduce the gap on Man City even further, ambition must always be at the forefront of their plans moving forward

                With a depth of 46 km, the second quake's epicenter is 50 km from Latakia, the capital of the namesake province

            <p>
                The Syrian Health Ministry announced on Tuesday that the final death toll from the earthquake that hit Syria stands at 1,414, while the number of injured people reached 2,357

                United were leading 2-1 in the first leg of their Europa League round-of-32 tie when Marcus Rashford went down under a challenge from Kounde as he looked to run through on goal

            <p>

            <p>
                So he said it was outside the box and it was no foul

                It's a big influence, not only on this game but in this round, and referees can't make such mistakes." Despite scoring his 22nd goal of the season and setting up the second through a Kounde own goal to put United in front, Rashford was also left furious at the decision not to flag for a foul after the collision with Kounde

                United were leading 2-1 in the first leg of their Europa League round-of-32 tie when Marcus Rashford went down under a challenge from Kounde as he looked to run through on goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I asked the referee why
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So he said it was outside the box and it was no foul
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the linesman and referee were in a very good position to see and I think we had VAR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think it's not good, it was a really bad decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's a big influence, not only on this game but in this round, and referees can't make such mistakes." Despite scoring his 22nd goal of the season and setting up the second through a Kounde own goal to put United in front, Rashford was also left furious at the decision not to flag for a foul after the collision with Kounde

                Lilly-Spells pointed to Dorsey's earlier decisions to shield from public view the results of police investigations, a 2010 confidentiality agreement between Ronaldo and Mayorga and allegedly stolen records of attorney-client discussions between Ronaldo and his lawyers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn Dorsey's dismissal last June of Mayorga's lawsuit, filed in September 2018 in state court and moved in January 2019 to federal court

            <p>
                Stovall argued that Mayorga, now 39, had learning disabilities as a child and was so pressured by Ronaldo's attorneys and representatives that she was in no condition to consent to dropping a criminal complaint she filed shortly after her encounter with Ronaldo and accepting the £311,156 ($375,000)

            <p>
                Dorsey's ruling on Tuesday was notable for the amount of the penalty she imposed -- just £33,190 ($40,000) less than the amount Stovall has acknowledged that Mayorga received in 2010

                Now is not a good time to be working in Britain’s car industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it is the announcement of several thousand job losses at Ford that will send the biggest shockwaves through the global car sector – 3,800 in total, 2,300 of which will come in Germany, 1,300 in the UK, and the remaining 200 across the rest of Europe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the central premises of net zero is that the resulting job destruction in old industries such as car-making, but also oil and gas exploration, construction and farming, will be more than offset by the job creation in green industries such as renewable energy – but if the remarks of Ford Germany’s boss Martin Sander are anything to go by, that looks doubtful at best
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are moving into a world with less [sic] global platforms where less engineering work is necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is why we have to make the adjustments.” Ford’s intervention is particularly significant because it is possible to extrapolate from the latest round of job cuts and arrive at an approximate figure for the industry as a whole as it goes electric
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But having been a late adopter, Ford is now among those leading the charge with a pledge to boost spending on electric vehicles to $50bn (£41bn), from $30bn previously, by 2026 and run its electric car unit separately from its legacy combustion engine operations, in a move aimed at catching trailblazer Tesla

                The big difference, though, is that you put money in a Roth account after it’s been taxed, meaning your dispersals in retirement are not taxed

                Starting in 2024, though, that will no longer be true — meaning if you save already-taxed money in a Roth 401(k), you can let it grow tax free for as long as you want

                Anwar, in an exclusive interview with the TRT World that was uploaded on YouTube yesterday, said Malaysia would do more in offering assistance after discussion he had with Turkiye President Recep Tayyip Erdogan

            <p>
                Anwar, who arrived home today, was in Turkiye to express support to the rescue teams as well as Malaysia’s commitment to helping its people affected by the twin earthquakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I need to express my sentiments, sympathy and support to the President and the people of Turkiye

            <p>
                “More than that, whenever Malaysia was in difficulty, Turkiye has been one of many countries that offered help and played its part
            </p>

                This country has that special relationship with Malaysia as a whole, with me personally (too)

                The magnitude 7.7 and 7.6 earthquakes that hit southern Turkiye and northwestern Syria on Feb 6 had killed at least 36,187 people and injured more than 100,000 others in Turkiye, while in Syria at least 5,329 people have died while 14,500 others were injured

                The Auditor-General’s 2021 Report found Pharmaniaga Logistics supplied 93 defective ventilators to MOH during the pandemic, costing the government RM13 million in losses that couldn’t be claimed because there were no documents on the procurement done via CSR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On that day, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) approved emergency procurement for the ventilators, enabling the MOH to make advance payment of RM30 million to Pharmaniaga Logistics – identified in the Auditor-General’s report with its company registration number (260790-T) – for the procurement of 500 ventilators costing an estimated RM50 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An additional RM3.97 million approved for Pharmaniaga Logistics to upgrade certain ventilators pushed the cost of the overall procurement of 136 ventilators to RM24.07 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The national audit found that – based on a report by a Covid-19 Pandemic Emergency Procurement Monitoring and Administration Committee meeting on May 23, 2022 – only 28 of the 136 ventilators supplied by Pharmaniaga Logistics to MOH facilities were usable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The national audit found that Pharmaniaga Logistics returned RM6.97 million of the RM30 million advance payment for the ventilators to MOH on June 18, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because there were no documents on the appointment of Company 260790-T by the MOH.” MOH told the national audit in a response last October 7 that no agreement was signed with Pharmaniaga Logistics because the procurement of ventilators was done under emergency procurement protocols

                The national audit found that – based on a report by a Covid-19 Pandemic Emergency Procurement Monitoring and Administration Committee meeting on May 23, 2022 – only 28 of the 136 ventilators supplied by Pharmaniaga Logistics to MOH facilities were usable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The national audit found that Pharmaniaga Logistics returned RM6.97 million of the RM30 million advance payment for the ventilators to MOH on June 18, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because there were no documents on the appointment of Company 260790-T by the MOH.” MOH told the national audit in a response last October 7 that no agreement was signed with Pharmaniaga Logistics because the procurement of ventilators was done under emergency procurement protocols

                About Us Advertise   PUTRAJAYA, Feb 16 — The Court of Appeal has rejected the appeal of two Kuantan businessmen over the usage of jawi on signboards at their premises

            <p>

            <p>
                Among others, the businessmen sought an order to revoke the Kuantan Municipal Council’s directions in an April 2019 letter for businesses to use jawi on signboards on their premises
            </p>

                It was reported that the Pahang state government decided in 2018 that all business premises and road signs would use jawi writing in efforts to uplift the use of jawi

            <p>
                “Presently, the amount of voluntary contributions is limited to a maximum of RM60,000, and the dividend is based on the amount of contributions made
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, if after this there is an increase in the amount of voluntary contributions, there will be an increase in the dividend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [If] the dividend announced by the EPF is large, then that is the dividend they will get,” he said

                The Filipino heirs of the last Sultan of Sulu are seeking to enforce a US$14.9-billion award granted to them by a French arbitration court last year, amid a long-running dispute with the Malaysian government over a colonial-era land deal

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 16 — Luxembourg court bailiffs issued fresh seizure orders for two units of Malaysian state oil firm Petronas this week, following a bid by descendants of a former sultanate to enforce a US$15-billion (RM66-billion) award they had won against Malaysia, according to the heirs’ lawyer and court documents seen by Reuters

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 16 ― PropertyGuru Malaysia’s Sale Demand Index dropped 14.8 per cent in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2022, reflecting how potential buyers may still be facing affordability issues or a lack of confidence towards the current property prices on the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report showed an uptrend in PropertyGuru Malaysia’s Sale Price Index by 1.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) following the increased Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 2.75 per cent last year, contributing towards the higher overall cost of property ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the whole of 2022, the asking prices listed on PropertyGuru.com.my went up by 5.0 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the report also found that following rising property prices, potential homebuyers gravitated towards the rental market, seeing that the Rental Demand Index increased 32.9 per cent in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The supply of rental listings on PropertyGuru’s website increased by 19.6 per cent, as landlords were jumping back into a rental market with positive demand, seeking alternative income sources to offset inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Fernandez said as the Malaysian economy is expected to expand by 4.0 to 5.0 per cent in 2023, the property market is likely to remain active with positive growth

            <p>
                Those who fail to use jawi script on their signboards can be fined up to RM250, and have their business licences revoked, if they refuse to comply with the directive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said they were not raising the issue that Jawi was not part of the national language but that mandating the use of Jawi writing on signboards had nothing to do with "the interest of the local authority area" in line with Section 9 of the Local Government Act 1976
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saiful, who is also Pahang State legal adviser, also stated that Bahasa Melayu is not just limited to the Roman script added that he did not see how the use of Jawi can discriminate against the rakyat as it would only enrich the people

                You would also have had to spend RM1,023 on petrol for these peak hour trips on your vehicle last year, with about one-fifth or RM221 due to traffic jams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In other words, because of traffic jams, Kuala Lumpur drivers would have spent an extra nine minutes more driving per 10km trip during the morning rush hour, and 12 minutes more during the evening rush hour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TomTom's calculations are based on the assumption of Kuala Lumpur drivers making a 10 km trip during the busiest hour in the morning and cover the same distance during the busiest hour in the evening, and totalled up over an assumed 230 working days per year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On weekdays, the busiest hour for driving in Kuala Lumpur's city centre in the morning would be the 8am to 9am slot (ranging from 18 minutes to 21 minutes), and the 6pm to 7pm slot in the evening (ranging from over 22 minutes to over 25 minutes)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TomTom's data showed that the worst rush hour in the week in Kuala Lumpur would typically fall on Thursdays during the 6pm to 7pm slot, where it would take 25 minutes 20 seconds on average to drive 10km in the city centre area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In comparison to Kuala Lumpur drivers spending 159 hours on the road in peak hours in the city centre last year, Singapore drivers would have spent slightly less time at 150 hours

                TomTom's calculations are based on the assumption of Kuala Lumpur drivers making a 10 km trip during the busiest hour in the morning and cover the same distance during the busiest hour in the evening, and totalled up over an assumed 230 working days per year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On weekdays, the busiest hour for driving in Kuala Lumpur's city centre in the morning would be the 8am to 9am slot (ranging from 18 minutes to 21 minutes), and the 6pm to 7pm slot in the evening (ranging from over 22 minutes to over 25 minutes)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TomTom's data showed that the worst rush hour in the week in Kuala Lumpur would typically fall on Thursdays during the 6pm to 7pm slot, where it would take 25 minutes 20 seconds on average to drive 10km in the city centre area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In comparison to Kuala Lumpur drivers spending 159 hours on the road in peak hours in the city centre last year, Singapore drivers would have spent slightly less time at 150 hours
            </p>

                The company, which is set to list on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia on March 10, 2023, said the public issue will entail 173 million new shares at 90 sen per share

            <p>
                Post-IPO, Cape EMS is expected to have a market capitalisation of about RM830.7mil based on the enlarged share capital of 923 million shares and retail price of 90 sen per share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to non-independent managing director and group CEO Tee Kim Chin, Cape EMS started with providing EMS for industrial electronic products but has expanded its product portfolio to include both industrial and consumer electronic products such as wireless communication equipment, smart utility data collection equipment, point of sales terminals, household appliances and electronic cigarettes for both regional and overseas markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Our strong financial performance has provided us with the resources to continue to invest into our manufacturing facilities to be ready to capture more market share by taking on more orders for new products from existing and new customers in both the industrial and consumer electronic products segment," she said in a statement announcing the launch of the company's IPO prospectus
            </p>

                "The projected growth of the global semiconductor and electronics markets will drive the demand for EMS, and we have set sights on the huge growth potential of both the local and global EMS industries." Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd is the principal adviser, joint bookrunner and joint underwriter of the IPO while AmInvestment Bank Bhd is the joint bookrunner and joint underwriter.

                Luxembourg court bailiffs issued fresh seizure orders for two units of oil firm Petronas this week, following a bid by descendants of a former sultanate to enforce a US$15-billion (RM66 billion) award they had won against Malaysia, according to the heirs' lawyer and court documents seen by Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia, which did not participate in the arbitration, maintains the process is illegal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Petronas Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz) and Petronas South Caucasus units were first seized in July 2022, but the Malaysian government said last month that the order had been set aside by a Luxembourg district court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cohen, of British law firm 4-5 Gray's Inn Square, told Reuters the Luxembourg district court had indeed lifted the first seizure order on a minor issue that has since been addressed, but had not made a judgment on the merits of the arbitration
            </p>

                Luxembourg court bailiffs issued fresh seizure orders for two units of oil firm Petronas this week, following a bid by descendants of a former sultanate to enforce a US$15-billion (RM66 billion) award they had won against Malaysia, according to the heirs' lawyer and court documents seen by Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia, which did not participate in the arbitration, maintains the process is illegal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Petronas Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz) and Petronas South Caucasus units were first seized in July 2022, but the Malaysian government said last month that the order had been set aside by a Luxembourg district court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cohen, of British law firm 4-5 Gray's Inn Square, told Reuters the Luxembourg district court had indeed lifted the first seizure order on a minor issue that has since been addressed, but had not made a judgment on the merits of the arbitration

                "That is why the government has no plans to allow any more EPF withdrawals in the near future," said Ahmad at a press conference in Parliament on Thursday (Feb 16)

                The figure consists of RM20.8bil by 5.3 million members under the i-Lestari programme, RM58.7bil by 6.6 million members under i-Sinar, RM21.4bil by 5.2 million members under i-Citra and RM44.6bil by 6.6 million members during an EPF special withdrawal programme last year

                Ahmad said the median savings in EPF accounts for all Malaysians stood at RM8,100 as of last year, which was a decrease of 50 percent from RM16,600 in 2019
            </p>

                Some 6.7 million members or 51.5 percent of 13.1 million EPF members, have savings of less than RM10,000

            <p>
                Jalynn Woon was surprised to find a stack of S$100 notes inside an unattended bag in front of her bak kut teh stall in Jurong West
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To her surprise, she found a large sum of money inside
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To his relief, it was with Woon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I’m not sure if the money was condolence money collected from the funeral as he did not specify.” To express his gratitude, Bay told her he would ask his friends to patronise her stall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fortunately, Woon had kept the bag safe and all the money was intact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “My uncle is grateful to Woon for her kind gesture and uprightness.”

                In a statement on Wednesday (Feb 15), the international rating agency said Malaysia's ratings balance a diversified economy with strong medium-term growth prospects against high public debt, a low revenue base relative to the operating expenditures, and political uncertainty that hinders long-term policymaking

                The rating agency said fiscal policy plans of the newly elected government will only become clearer when the full Budget 2023 is retabled on Feb 24, but deficit reductions will be gradual, as the government is likely to avoid resorting to unpopular revenue measures

                The flat front end, small and boring wheels across the range, understyled rear end make it perhaps Perodua’s most love-it-or-hate-it design yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Missing in the latest range is an SUV-inspired Axia Style variant, which was available in the previous 2019 update for the first-gen Axia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It doesn’t take much
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The changes have a significant effect on the overall appearance of the Axia – the front immediately looks more menacing, while the rear even looks fairly fashionable now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps Perodua is saving the Style for an upcoming mid-life update, or maybe not at all if it has deemed the outgoing Axia Style a sales failure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whatever the case, what do you think of this theoretical (see what I did there?) 2023 Perodua Axia Style, folks? Leave your comments below

                The flat front end, small and boring wheels across the range, understyled rear end make it perhaps Perodua’s most love-it-or-hate-it design yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Missing in the latest range is an SUV-inspired Axia Style variant, which was available in the previous 2019 update for the first-gen Axia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It doesn’t take much
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The changes have a significant effect on the overall appearance of the Axia – the front immediately looks more menacing, while the rear even looks fairly fashionable now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps Perodua is saving the Style for an upcoming mid-life update, or maybe not at all if it has deemed the outgoing Axia Style a sales failure
            </p>
            
            <p>

                DRESS CODE IN LINE WITH RUKUN NEGARA Incidentally, the dress code at government premises – which is just a guideline and cannot be enforced as law – is in line with the fifth principle of the Rukun Negara, namely courtesy and morality, which is aimed at fostering unity among the people through good behaviour

                “People who don’t adhere to the dress code are mainly those ignorant of the rules,” he said, adding that lax enforcement in some premises can also give the impression to the public that the dress code is no longer applicable

            <p>
                With this in mind, Liverpool need to step up their negotiations if they are to land the ‘sensational’ star from Dortmund.

                FFB said the proposals will pave the way for the group’s entry and ownership in one of the fastest growing artisanal ice creameries and the largest home-grown ice-cream chain in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between the financial years 2017 to 2021, the filing said TISSB group’s revenue grew from RM10 million to RM36.3 million, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Post completion of the proposals, FFB said Edmund Tan and Lim will drive TISSB’s existing ice cream business, which will form part of the FFB Group’s ice cream division
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FFB said the group’s diversification into the artisan ice cream chain business would serve as an opportunity to mitigate its concentration risk on its core business of rearing dairy cows and the production and marketing and sale of dairy milk products

                Public health advocate and former Health Ministry official Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar said there was a need to review the standard operating procedures for patients coming in to the department and admissions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Green zone cases should go to health clinics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There should be a new operation schedule for health clinics based on location, patient load and staff,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former deputy health minister Dr Lee Boon Chye said among the reasons for overcrowding at emergency departments was bed shortage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because health clinics and a lot of general practitioners’ clinics do not operate at night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Lee added that extended hours for health clinics would be a cost- effective way to divert green cases from emergency departments

                Arsenal had come from a goal down and looked capable of ending a 10-game losing streak in the league against City but they ultimately came up short as their hopes of a first league title since 2004 suffered a setback

                The Deputy Prime Minister says the projects were halted after a review of procurement procedures were carried out at his ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who is also Rural and Regional Development Minister, said the Finance Ministry had ordered for the halt as some of the projects were awarded through direct tender or selected tender
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the order was for projects under the Jana Wibawa programme awarded by his ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The directive by the Prime Minister is to carry out a review to determine if procurement procedures involving each spending had followed rules set by the Treasury,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid gave his assurance that despite the directive, there would be no compromise nor delay on the implementation of infrastructure projects in rural areas, including in Sabah and Sarawak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The ministry will see to it that the time frame in implementing infrastructure projects in rural areas will proceed as planned and not be affected by the temporary halt in Jana Wibawa-related projects,” he added

                The Deputy Prime Minister says the projects were halted after a review of procurement procedures were carried out at his ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who is also Rural and Regional Development Minister, said the Finance Ministry had ordered for the halt as some of the projects were awarded through direct tender or selected tender
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the order was for projects under the Jana Wibawa programme awarded by his ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The directive by the Prime Minister is to carry out a review to determine if procurement procedures involving each spending had followed rules set by the Treasury,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid gave his assurance that despite the directive, there would be no compromise nor delay on the implementation of infrastructure projects in rural areas, including in Sabah and Sarawak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The ministry will see to it that the time frame in implementing infrastructure projects in rural areas will proceed as planned and not be affected by the temporary halt in Jana Wibawa-related projects,” he added
            </p>

                Tom's Racing's Toyota GR Corolla upgrades will be available later this year                         Thought the Toyota GR Corolla was already as insane as a hot hatch can be? Well, Tom’s Racing has just previewed its slew of upgrades for the ultimate GR Corolla and it makes the standard model seem somewhat pedestrian
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given that Katasuta races for the Toyota Gazoo Racing team, he knows exactly how to make a car like the GR Corolla even more impressive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tom’s Racing refers to its creation as the GR Corolla Type TK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two large canards are also found on either side of the front bumper
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tom’s Racing has also added two additional exhausts, meaning the car has five in total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That may seem excessive but we think it suits the aggressive new nature of the hatch

                Tom's Racing's Toyota GR Corolla upgrades will be available later this year                         Thought the Toyota GR Corolla was already as insane as a hot hatch can be? Well, Tom’s Racing has just previewed its slew of upgrades for the ultimate GR Corolla and it makes the standard model seem somewhat pedestrian
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given that Katasuta races for the Toyota Gazoo Racing team, he knows exactly how to make a car like the GR Corolla even more impressive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tom’s Racing refers to its creation as the GR Corolla Type TK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two large canards are also found on either side of the front bumper
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tom’s Racing has also added two additional exhausts, meaning the car has five in total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That may seem excessive but we think it suits the aggressive new nature of the hatch
            </p>

                But 25-year-old Sarasadat Khademalsharieh, better known as Sara Khadem, also told Reuters that the warrant, which made her return to Iran impossible, was "the most horrible thing" that happened to her

            <p>
                She said that, after playing in December's FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in Kazakhstan's Almaty without the headscarf mandatory under Iran's strict Islamic dress code, she had hardly expected harsher reprisals than a travel ban

                "But it (no hijab) has become one of the symbols of the movement in Iran and I also decided to finally do something that I wanted to, to be myself...I was motivated by the people of Iran." Laws enforcing mandatory hijab-wearing have become a flashpoint during the unrest that has swept Iran since mid-September when a 22-year-old Iranian-Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, died in the custody of the morality police
            </p>

                "There are lots of things that people are not happy about at the moment, so even if this time it doesn't change anything, I think there will come a time when people will rise up again," said Khadem, who does not consider herself a political activist, but wants to be a voice for change

                The Mercedes-Maybach S580e’s hybrid system pairs a 3.0 litre inline-six engine making 367 hp and 500 Nm of torque to a 150 hp, 440 Nm electric motor sandwiched between the engine and the 9G-Tronic gearbox
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, the sole Mercedes-Maybach S-Class with a published pricelist in Malaysia is the S580 (with no e), with a 1.9 million ringgit pricetag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s got a mild 48V hybrid 20 PS, 200 Nm motor, but hybrid assist capabilities are far from what the plug-in hybrid is capable of
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The range topper is the Mercedes-Maybach S680, which doesn’t have an official pricelist, but we are sure if your pockets are deep enough you can order one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No 48V hybrid system here – powering the S680 is purely a 6.0 litre V12 engine making 621 hp and 1000 Nm of torque
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Want to go greener than this Maybach S580e? You’ll have to wait for the production version of the Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV for that

                Well, here’s Theophilus Chin‘s take on an Axia-based new Bezza sedan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It needs to be mentioned though that the actual second-generation Bezza will likely have a completely different face to the Axia, as seen on the first gen model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With 2023 out of the question, we’re looking at next year as the earliest time possible for an all-new Bezza sedan, and even that is not confirmed yet

                Well, here’s Theophilus Chin‘s take on an Axia-based new Bezza sedan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It needs to be mentioned though that the actual second-generation Bezza will likely have a completely different face to the Axia, as seen on the first gen model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With 2023 out of the question, we’re looking at next year as the earliest time possible for an all-new Bezza sedan, and even that is not confirmed yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Use own Geely brand here, not Proton

                In a statement today, Anwar said the affirmation also showed the international rating agency’s confidence in the strength of Malaysia’s economic recovery as well as the country’s resilience amidst an uncertain and highly challenging global landscape
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Malaysia’s ratings balance a diversified economy with strong medium-term growth prospects against high public debt, a low revenue base relative to the operating expenditures,” said Anwar, citing Fitch’s statement released yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Fitch, Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to moderate to four per cent in 2023 and 4.8 per cent in 2024, from a strong growth of 8.7 per cent in 2022 amid easing of Covid-19 restrictions and as the government continues to provide relief measures and support towards rapid and broad recovery of the economy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moving forward, Anwar said the government is determined to ensure that the nation’s fiscal position continues to strengthen through gradual consolidation of the fiscal deficit, while balancing the need to support economic growth during these challenging times globally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Through Budget 2023, which will be tabled on February 24, 2023, the government will continue to intensify reform efforts to drive the country’s economic recovery, boost investment and improve public infrastructure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Anwar said Budget 2023 will focus on strengthening the country’s finances and governance, to support the government’s commitment to sustain the economic recovery momentum towards improving the people’s well-being, in line with the budget’s theme of “Building Malaysia Madani.” — Bernama

                The PCG earlier reported that its crew members were temporarily blinded after a CCG directed a “military-grade” laser to their vessel in Ayungin Shoal in the West Philippine Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a transcript sent by the Chinese Embassy in Manila late Wednesday (Feb 15), Wang said that the Philippines’ allegation “does not reflect the truth.” “The China Coast Guard ship used hand-held laser speed detector and hand-held greenlight pointer to measure the distance and speed of the Philippine vessel and signal directions to ensure navigation safety,” Wang said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We need to highlight the fact that the China Coast Guard ship did not direct lasers at the Philippine crew, and the hand-held equipment does not inflict damage on anything or anyone on the vessel,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian has clarified the facts to Philippine leaders, Wang said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Philippine side has learned what actually happened,” said Wang

                The PCG earlier reported that its crew members were temporarily blinded after a CCG directed a “military-grade” laser to their vessel in Ayungin Shoal in the West Philippine Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a transcript sent by the Chinese Embassy in Manila late Wednesday (Feb 15), Wang said that the Philippines’ allegation “does not reflect the truth.” “The China Coast Guard ship used hand-held laser speed detector and hand-held greenlight pointer to measure the distance and speed of the Philippine vessel and signal directions to ensure navigation safety,” Wang said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We need to highlight the fact that the China Coast Guard ship did not direct lasers at the Philippine crew, and the hand-held equipment does not inflict damage on anything or anyone on the vessel,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian has clarified the facts to Philippine leaders, Wang said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Philippine side has learned what actually happened,” said Wang

                CIJ executive director Wathshlah Naidu made the call in response to the Malaysian government’s decision not to charge human rights activist Heidy Quah under Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA)

                Human rights activists, such as Heidy Quah, should not have been investigated and intimidated for speaking out and critiquing government action,” she said

                On April 25 last year, the Sessions Court agreed with Quah’s preliminary objection against the charge which was said to be defective, and granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA)

                The DNAA meant Quah was released from the charge but the prosecution can still decide to pursue the case against her in the future

                Lee Kum Loon, 58, lost his final appeal to set aside his conviction and jail sentence

            <p>
                Justice Hanipah, who delivered the court's unanimous decision, said it was the court's view there was no specific meaning to the term "trafficking" in the Anti-Trafficking In Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 (ATIPSOM) and the court referred to a Cambridge dictionary to get the meaning of the term "trafficking"

            <p>
                Justice Hanipah said based on the overall evidence adduced in the court and the meaning of "trafficking" in the dictionary, the court found that the element of section 2 of ATIPSOM has been fulfilled

                On April 4, 2019, the Sessions Court found Lee guilty of the offence and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment

                The High Court, on March 10, 2020, dismissed Lee's appeal and increased his jail term to 10 years

            <p>
                Alexander-Arnold's low cross to Cody Gakpo for Liverpool's second goal on Monday doesn't technically count as an assist, simply because it grazed the knee of Vitalii Mykolenko on its way to the back post

            <p>
                After failing to assist a goal in any of his first 19 appearances this season, Alexander-Arnold has now set up three in his last seven matches (if indeed you count his pass for Gakpo on Monday night)

                International travellers who arrive in Thailand by air will be charged a tourism fee of 300 baht per person and 150 baht if they arrive by land or sea.  Tourists take photos on the beach at Maya Bay in Krabi province, southern Thailand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For travellers who arrive by land or sea, the fee is 150 baht per person, said the deputy spokesperson to the Prime Minister's Office Traisulee Traisoranakul after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday (Feb 14).  “The collected fee will be used to manage and develop tourism, which includes insurance for international tourists during their stay in Thailand,” said Ms Traisulee.  Travellers will be exempted from the tourism fee if they hold a diplomatic or official passport, or a work permit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Cabinet has also instructed the Immigration Bureau to review the visa rules, regulations and conditions as well as related immigration laws, in view of the new requirement to impose the tourism fee.  The changes should include proof of payment for the fee as part of the immigration process.  Citing a study by Thailand's ministry of tourism and sports, Ms Traisulee said Thailand is the first country in the world to collect a tourism fee and at the same time provide welfare benefits for tourists, including a personal accident insurance protection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She added that the money collected from the tourism fee will help reduce financial burdens on the Thai government, which spends about 300 million to 400 million baht per year in providing healthcare for tourists.  Other expenditures incurred by the government include the preservation of tourist attractions, the environment and natural resources that have been affected by tourism activities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tourism fee will come into effect no sooner than 90 days after it has been announced in the Royal Gazette
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thailand’s tourism industry, which is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, registered only about 430,000 tourist arrivals in 2021.  More than 11 million international tourist arrivals were recorded between January and December last year, after Thailand gradually lifted its COVID-related travel restrictions from 2021

                International travellers who arrive in Thailand by air will be charged a tourism fee of 300 baht per person and 150 baht if they arrive by land or sea.  Tourists take photos on the beach at Maya Bay in Krabi province, southern Thailand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For travellers who arrive by land or sea, the fee is 150 baht per person, said the deputy spokesperson to the Prime Minister's Office Traisulee Traisoranakul after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday (Feb 14).  “The collected fee will be used to manage and develop tourism, which includes insurance for international tourists during their stay in Thailand,” said Ms Traisulee.  Travellers will be exempted from the tourism fee if they hold a diplomatic or official passport, or a work permit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Cabinet has also instructed the Immigration Bureau to review the visa rules, regulations and conditions as well as related immigration laws, in view of the new requirement to impose the tourism fee.  The changes should include proof of payment for the fee as part of the immigration process.  Citing a study by Thailand's ministry of tourism and sports, Ms Traisulee said Thailand is the first country in the world to collect a tourism fee and at the same time provide welfare benefits for tourists, including a personal accident insurance protection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She added that the money collected from the tourism fee will help reduce financial burdens on the Thai government, which spends about 300 million to 400 million baht per year in providing healthcare for tourists.  Other expenditures incurred by the government include the preservation of tourist attractions, the environment and natural resources that have been affected by tourism activities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tourism fee will come into effect no sooner than 90 days after it has been announced in the Royal Gazette
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thailand’s tourism industry, which is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, registered only about 430,000 tourist arrivals in 2021.  More than 11 million international tourist arrivals were recorded between January and December last year, after Thailand gradually lifted its COVID-related travel restrictions from 2021

                PSG manager Christophe Galtier will need to figure out how to deal with Coman in the second leg
            </p>

                If Nagelsmann gets all of his individuals firing, Bayern should have more than enough to see off PSG in the second leg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hakimi missed PSG's loss to Monaco on Saturday due to a hamstring issue, a decision PSG highlighted as precautionary in order to get their star right-back ready for Bayern
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If PSG get a full 90 minutes out of him in the second leg, the scoreline might look very different

                In yet another significant milestone for Mercedes-Benz Malaysia (MBM), the company today officially announced that the Mercedes-Benz Pekan production plant has begun to roll out Mercedes EQ all-electric vehicles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This particular facility which has been in operation for the past 19 years has rolled out more than 100,000 Mercedes-Benz vehicles to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While one may though that the first rollout of Malaysian-made EQ vehicles would be the entry-level EQA, that isn’t the case at all
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, the first EQ model to be assembled in Pekan is the flagship executive sedan EQS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This made Pekan as the third oversea Mercedes-Benz assembly facility to work on EQS after Pune in India and Thailand’s Samut Prakan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only that, the variant that Mercedes-Benz chose as the first Made-In-Pekan EQ model is the EQS 500 4MATIC which is a more powerful model than the fully imported EQS 450+ that was launched in Malaysia last year

                Liverpool's new sporting director may have a slight Mohamed Salah 'problem' he needs to address for Jürgen Klopp and he could do it with what could be an easy fix
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the sole right-winger at the club, especially since Sadio Mané's departure, Salah has had to play week in and week out essentially without much of a rest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! That can be solved by signing a back-up option who can compete with Salah for the right-wing spot and also provide cover when Salah isn't 100 per cent match fit or needs a rest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The club's new sporting director will have to find the right fit, and for the right price as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But there's one player who could just be available for the right price who has been catching the eye on the right wing and who could definitely take Salah's place in the side first as a back-up and then as his heir in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Toulouse is owned by RedBird Capital, who also has a minority investment in Liverpool meaning there is already a business partnership there, and interest for RedBird that could make them more open to selling a prized asset for a more 'favorable' price in Liverpool's favor

                Liverpool's new sporting director may have a slight Mohamed Salah 'problem' he needs to address for Jürgen Klopp and he could do it with what could be an easy fix
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the sole right-winger at the club, especially since Sadio Mané's departure, Salah has had to play week in and week out essentially without much of a rest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! That can be solved by signing a back-up option who can compete with Salah for the right-wing spot and also provide cover when Salah isn't 100 per cent match fit or needs a rest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The club's new sporting director will have to find the right fit, and for the right price as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But there's one player who could just be available for the right price who has been catching the eye on the right wing and who could definitely take Salah's place in the side first as a back-up and then as his heir in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Toulouse is owned by RedBird Capital, who also has a minority investment in Liverpool meaning there is already a business partnership there, and interest for RedBird that could make them more open to selling a prized asset for a more 'favorable' price in Liverpool's favor

                Dutch forward Cody Gakpo impressed while leading the line as he scored his first goal for Liverpool in the 2-0 win over Merseyside rivals Everton on Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is true that the sight of Liverpool, having rode their luck in their own box just moments before, surging forward on the counter-attack for their first goal last night brought back memories of 2017-18 when Jürgen Klopp first unleashed his famous front three of Sadio Mane, Firmino and Salah

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! It could be too premature to suggest that Liverpool are back to their old selves but, this said, Liverpool looked a lot closer to their best against the Toffees

            <p>
                Of course, Gakpo showed signs last night that he can operate in a false nine role akin to what Firmino has for Liverpool but, given Klopp’s desire for his players to be comfortable in a variety of positions, this tweak to the Dutchman’s role doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the spotlight having been on Liverpool's midfield during a dismal January, perhaps Gakpo's performance last night offers a glimmer of hope that solutions can be found within the squad for the time being

            <p>
                Earlier, Anwar, the Finance Minister, also told the House that government liabilities and debts stood at almost RM1.5 trillion, or 82% of the national gross domestic product (GDP)
            </p>

                Anwar assured Parliament that he would not abuse his position as Finance Minister

                Anwar’s decision in December last year to be Finance Minister came under criticism as Pakatan Harapan had pledged in its 2018 General Election manifesto that the prime minister would not hold the finance portfolio in its administration

                Earlier, Anwar, the Finance Minister, also told the House that government liabilities and debts stood at almost RM1.5 trillion, or 82% of the national gross domestic product (GDP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He noted that the government paid RM41bil last year as debt service charges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar assured Parliament that he would not abuse his position as Finance Minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar’s decision in December last year to be Finance Minister came under criticism as Pakatan Harapan had pledged in its 2018 General Election manifesto that the prime minister would not hold the finance portfolio in its administration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Seri Najib Razak was the last prime minister to hold the finance portfolio

                In India, Honda City is positioned as a premium family car instead of a sporty sedan

                It means that the new Honda City facelift will be available with two powertrain options

                I always thought zero emissions suited the drop top MINI and it seems someone in Munich agrees too, as an all-electric MINI Convertible is finally here, though just limited to 999 units and in two colours

                While some may argue about the somewhat limited range, I personally find it at a sweet spot as a daily driver those chrome toggling flick switches are SEXY! Is Mini as a brand still relevant these days? I am suprised Mini is still exist especially in Malaysia Dont see why not

                I always thought zero emissions suited the drop top MINI and it seems someone in Munich agrees too, as an all-electric MINI Convertible is finally here, though just limited to 999 units and in two colours
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Specs for the new MINI Cooper SE Convertible (or MINI Electric Convertible) are fixed and it is only available in Enigmatic Black and White Silver, with the door handles, side scuttles and light surrounds finished in Resolute Bronze

                Research MINI Cars at  Comments Always loved the mini, with each iteration, they have simply just improved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While some may argue about the somewhat limited range, I personally find it at a sweet spot as a daily driver those chrome toggling flick switches are SEXY! Is Mini as a brand still relevant these days? I am suprised Mini is still exist especially in Malaysia Dont see why not
            </p>

                India is especially fond of the mini not mr bean’s iconic authentic mini No 4door version?the EV i mean, not the drop top

                Malaysia Bid Round 2023 offers 10 exploration blocks and two clusters of Discovered Resource Opportunities (DRO)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PSC partners for the nine exploration blocks include Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB) and E&P Malaysia Venture Sdn Bhd (EPMV) for Block PM327; Skye UMDP Exploration Bhd and PCSB for Block PM340; PCSB, PTTEP Sarawak Oil Limited and Petroleum Sarawak EP (PSEP) for Block SK325; and Sarawak Shell Bhd, PCSB and PSEP for Block 3B

            <p>
                "The first of the nine PSCs signed today also marks the 200th PSC awarded by Petronas since the maiden PSC signed in 1976,” senior vice president, Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM) at Petronas, Mohamed Firouz Asnan said in a statement today

            <p>
                According to Petronas, the award of these nine blocks has also reduced the number of Malaysia’s open blocks by about a third, in line with MPM’s efforts to increase exploration investments in the country

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pilot, Philip Mehrtens, who flew a plane operated by airline Susi Air, was abducted by fighters from the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) last week after landing in the remote region of Nduga

                The figure, the largest among the 20 provincial economies, was up 56.8 per cent from COVID-related spending in 2021 and more than double 2020's spending

                In February 2021, statutory board Enterprise Singapore and the industry-led Singapore Standards Council issued guidelines for the proper handling, storing and processing of RTE raw fish.  The aim is to prevent bacterial and parasitic contamination and keep raw fish safe for consumption

            <p>
                Industry players are recommended to ensure that frozen RTE raw fish is received at specific temperatures, and to educate consumers on how to retain the quality and safety of raw fish after purchase, among other things

                The 2021 guidelines also suggest making RTE raw fish the last item to put in your shopping basket, and to keep it in an insulated bag after

                Instructions on the package on how to handle and store the RTE raw fish should be followed.  The fish should be placed in the chiller at temperatures between zero degrees Celsius and four degrees Celsius soon after purchase, added SFA.  When handling the fish, hands and utensils should be thoroughly washed before and after to prevent cross-contamination.  And if it's not obvious enough - do not consume expired RTE raw fish.  "Consumers who choose to eat RTE raw fish must be aware of the risks involved," said SFA

                The entry fee, widely criticized by local tourism industry, comes as the nation famed for its Buddhist temples, beaches and national parks is witnessing a rush in tourist arrivals that’s gained momentum with the abolition of pandemic-era curbs and China’s move to end it Zero-Covid policy

                Johor Chief Minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi and Singapore Transport Minister S Iswaran, who is also the country's Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, meeting during Mr Onn Hafiz's three-day visit to Singapore on Feb 14, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said at that time that the terminal is a key international entry point that increases access for tourists to come to Johor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Onn Hafiz said that last year, more than 141,000 tourists came from Batam and Tanjung Balai in Indonesia to Puteri terminal via ferry services owned and operated by Malaysia property developer UEM Sunrise.  Mr Onn Hafiz on Tuesday also shared other points of discussions between him and Mr Iswaran.  He said both of them agreed that the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link was a priority for both countries.  “I agree with his suggestion to closely monitor the project's development, and to set short term and medium term goals so that the project continues to be on track,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  The cross-border rail project aims to connect Bukit Chagar in Johor Bahru city to Woodlands in Singapore, serving about 10,000 passengers per hour each way to help ease traffic congestion on the Causeway
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is scheduled to be operational by end-2026.  Mr Onn Hafiz also reiterated a commitment he said was made recently by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to increase motorcycle lanes at the immigration complex in Bangunan Sultan Iskandar, which is linked to the Woodlands Causeway.  “It is generally known that the Johor-Singapore Causeway is one of the busiest land crossings in the world, with more than 300,000 Malaysians commuting daily from Johor Bahru to work in Singapore,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  The Machap state assemblyman added that he shared Mr Anwar’s willingness to see through a proposal to widen the lanes of the Johor portion of the North-South Highway.  “If this proposal is implemented, for sure it will benefit the business community in Singapore who wish to invest in Malaysia,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  “I once again express the willingness of the Johor State Government to foster future collaborations between Johor-Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This close ties is significant for both parties,” he added.  Tuesday was the last day of Mr Onn Hafiz’s three-day working visit to Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides Mr Iswaran, he also met with other Singapore leaders like Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan as well as Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman.  The chief minister also held meetings with business leaders as well as foreign corporations based in Singapore.  He said in a statement on Sunday that these companies were potential investors that could rake in between RM10 to RM15 billion (US$2.3 to US$3.45 billion) for the southern state and bring high paying jobs for Johoreans.  “The state government, with the help of the federal government, is committed to be facilitators and prepare utilities and infrastructure, to ensure a friendly business environment for investors across the world,” he added.

                It is scheduled to be operational by end-2026.  Mr Onn Hafiz also reiterated a commitment he said was made recently by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to increase motorcycle lanes at the immigration complex in Bangunan Sultan Iskandar, which is linked to the Woodlands Causeway.  “It is generally known that the Johor-Singapore Causeway is one of the busiest land crossings in the world, with more than 300,000 Malaysians commuting daily from Johor Bahru to work in Singapore,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  The Machap state assemblyman added that he shared Mr Anwar’s willingness to see through a proposal to widen the lanes of the Johor portion of the North-South Highway.  “If this proposal is implemented, for sure it will benefit the business community in Singapore who wish to invest in Malaysia,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  “I once again express the willingness of the Johor State Government to foster future collaborations between Johor-Singapore

                Besides Mr Iswaran, he also met with other Singapore leaders like Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan as well as Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman.  The chief minister also held meetings with business leaders as well as foreign corporations based in Singapore.  He said in a statement on Sunday that these companies were potential investors that could rake in between RM10 to RM15 billion (US$2.3 to US$3.45 billion) for the southern state and bring high paying jobs for Johoreans.  “The state government, with the help of the federal government, is committed to be facilitators and prepare utilities and infrastructure, to ensure a friendly business environment for investors across the world,” he added.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, Mr D.I.Y’s net profit rose 1.13% to RM136.1mil against RM134.5mil achieved in the same quarter last year

                (Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc., the data analysis company co-founded by Peter Thiel, said it was profitable for the first time in the fourth quarter, and expects 2023 to be its first-ever profitable year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Palantir reported $508.6 million in sales in the fourth quarter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Palantir’s revenue from its commercial clients, a closely watched metric, increased 11% to $215 million, in line with analyst estimates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In the military context, it has already arrived.” On the call, Palantir Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar said that the company had an eventful 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company’s sales to governments increased 23% to $293 million during the fourth quarter, with $225 million of that coming from deals with the US
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company’s adjusted operating margin was 22% in the fourth quarter, higher than analyst estimates of 15.75%

                Puteri Sarah filed for leave to initiate committal proceedings against Ira, whose full name is Faghira Fatini, her sister Yasmin, and Kazaruddin over an alleged breach of a court injunction following the revelation of Ira's marriage to Puteri Sarah's husband, actor and director Syamsul Yusof, last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the leave application filed on Jan 31, Puteri Sarah, whose full name is Puteri Sarah Liyana Megat Kamaruddin, claimed that the three defendants had committed contempt of court when they voluntarily violated an inter-parte injunction order dated July 4 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The injunction order was part of a lawsuit filed by Puteri Sarah in June, after she claimed she was on the receiving end of a barrage of harassment and threats from Ira, 27, via social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 6, Syamsul admitted in an Instagram video that he had married Ira in Thailand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 16, Puteri Sarah filed for divorce from Syamsul after almost nine years of marriage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Puteri Sarah also stated that she and her children no longer lived with Syamsul, either at her in-laws’ house or at their matrimonial home in Taman Melawati

                Puteri Sarah filed for leave to initiate committal proceedings against Ira, whose full name is Faghira Fatini, her sister Yasmin, and Kazaruddin over an alleged breach of a court injunction following the revelation of Ira's marriage to Puteri Sarah's husband, actor and director Syamsul Yusof, last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the leave application filed on Jan 31, Puteri Sarah, whose full name is Puteri Sarah Liyana Megat Kamaruddin, claimed that the three defendants had committed contempt of court when they voluntarily violated an inter-parte injunction order dated July 4 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The injunction order was part of a lawsuit filed by Puteri Sarah in June, after she claimed she was on the receiving end of a barrage of harassment and threats from Ira, 27, via social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 6, Syamsul admitted in an Instagram video that he had married Ira in Thailand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 16, Puteri Sarah filed for divorce from Syamsul after almost nine years of marriage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Puteri Sarah also stated that she and her children no longer lived with Syamsul, either at her in-laws’ house or at their matrimonial home in Taman Melawati

                According to the facts of the case, both the accused and the victim were colleagues at a reflexology centre but Nur Shahirah was fired a few weeks before the incident at the restaurant

                Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said Malaysia is seriously looking into policies that will support energy sectors to ensure that the EV ecosystem is complete and fully supported, including standards, certification and verification related to charging systems and battery disposal activities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Opportunities abound in the areas of renewable energy (RE), energy efficiency, energy storage systems, and support services for EVs, such as EV charging stations, operation and maintenance,” he said in his keynote address at Malaysia’s EV Conference 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To capitalise on the EV market, Tengku Zafrul said the government will also strengthen Malaysia’s Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the government has made a firm commitment to strategically develop the automotive industry, particularly the EV industry, as part of the zero greenhouse gas (GHG) target by 2050
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the shift to RE sources and electric transportation is a significant step towards Malaysia’s commitment to net-zero GHG by 2050, as outlined in the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (12MP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tengku Zafrul added that under the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021-2030, Malaysia aims to have EVs and hybrid to account for at least 15 per cent of the total industry volume (TIV) by 2030

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 14 — Malaysia is taking steps to strengthen its position through various policy measures, leveraging the existing electric vehicles (EV) ecosystem and ensuring a solid talent pipeline to help the development of the EV industry in Malaysia, said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said Malaysia is seriously looking into policies that will support energy sectors to ensure that the EV ecosystem is complete and fully supported, including standards, certification and verification related to charging systems and battery disposal activities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To capitalise on the EV market, Tengku Zafrul said the government will also strengthen Malaysia’s Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the government has made a firm commitment to strategically develop the automotive industry, particularly the EV industry, as part of the zero greenhouse gas (GHG) target by 2050
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the shift to RE sources and electric transportation is a significant step towards Malaysia’s commitment to net-zero GHG by 2050, as outlined in the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (12MP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tengku Zafrul added that under the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021-2030, Malaysia aims to have EVs and hybrid to account for at least 15 per cent of the total industry volume (TIV) by 2030

                Spearman's pitch control model can determine the optimal decision for any player in possession at any given moment — which can help players improve and reflect upon their performances — and his work has even allowed the Reds to determine pressing 'victims' by calculating the amount of time it takes for each of their opponents to control the ball; those who require more time can be exploited

            <p>
                By naming Spearman as Graham's heir, Liverpool is fostering some much needed continuity at a turbulent time for the club, and it is replacing a pioneer with an innovator.

                Spearman's pitch control model can determine the optimal decision for any player in possession at any given moment — which can help players improve and reflect upon their performances — and his work has even allowed the Reds to determine pressing 'victims' by calculating the amount of time it takes for each of their opponents to control the ball; those who require more time can be exploited

                Graham has managed Liverpool's data science department for more than a decade but earlier this term, news emerged of his impending resignation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By naming Spearman as Graham's heir, Liverpool is fostering some much needed continuity at a turbulent time for the club, and it is replacing a pioneer with an innovator.

                As stated under Section 27 of the EPF Act 1991, the guaranteed minimum dividend rate is 2.5% per year on members’ savings

                However, the dividend rate for Simpanan Shariah is based on the actual performance of Shariah-compliant investment without any minimum guaranteed dividend of 2.5%, according to information at the fund’s website

                According to the breakdown provided by EPF, the payout amount required for every 1% dividend rate for that year was RM8.25 billion for Simpanan Konvensional and RM972 million for Simpanan Shariah.  EPF has gone through a tough time with the Covid-19 pandemic badgering markets all around

                Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah delivering his Royal Address in the Dewan Rakyat on Monday (Feb 13)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Institute for Research and Development of Policy (IRDP) research and advocacy officer Farhan Rawi said all input and content of the decree are also a good start for MPs to begin their debate on the Royal Address on Tuesday (Feb 14)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you look at it, there are many inputs or information that His Majesty has decreed and it is a policy speech that should be the reference for MPs to see what are the priorities and direction that the government will undertake this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad said that His Majesty’s decree contained three items of significance, namely the togetherness between the Royal Institution and the government, His Majesty’s desire for the existing government administration, thus becoming a stage for the King to give advice not only to the MPs but also to the government and the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad added that the decree by His Majesty, who hoped that the government would be able to carry out its responsibility of governing the country and the Opposition would carry out its responsibility by offering constructive criticism for the good of the people and the country, was something that needed to be heeded by all parties

                Manchester United loan signing Marcel Sabitzer has made a positive early impression since signing for the club on deadline day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has told how he is happy at the club so far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I’m feeling good and I’m liking it here so far.” “It’s a loan and that’s all I can say [about that] at the moment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What I can say is I’m feeling very good here, I like the team, I like the club, I like the atmosphere at Old Trafford… so we will see what happens in the summer.” A report from ESPN last week reported Manchester United will weigh up a move for Sabitzer permanently in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The club are said to have advised him it is an option
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is a lot to achieve between now and the end of May, and if Sabitzer can play a role in trophy success, the club will certainly look more favourably towards a deal.

                Manchester United loan signing Marcel Sabitzer has made a positive early impression since signing for the club on deadline day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has told how he is happy at the club so far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I’m feeling good and I’m liking it here so far.” “It’s a loan and that’s all I can say [about that] at the moment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What I can say is I’m feeling very good here, I like the team, I like the club, I like the atmosphere at Old Trafford… so we will see what happens in the summer.” A report from ESPN last week reported Manchester United will weigh up a move for Sabitzer permanently in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The club are said to have advised him it is an option
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is a lot to achieve between now and the end of May, and if Sabitzer can play a role in trophy success, the club will certainly look more favourably towards a deal.

                China's accusation widened a dispute with United States that began last weekend after the US military shot down what it says was a Chinese spy balloon, prompting top US diplomat Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to Beijing designed to ease tensions

                GARY NEVILLE was left baffled by the Premier League's "third man rule" after Ruben Dias and Mario Lemina bookings for dissent

            </p>

                “What happens to the fourth, if there’s a fourth that attends the scene?” Ex-Premier League official Dermot Gallagher denied the "third man" rule after Lemina and Dias' bookings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That's what the referee is upset about there and it's nothing about being the third man there, it's all about players surrounding the referees

                GARY NEVILLE was left baffled by the Premier League's "third man rule" after Ruben Dias and Mario Lemina bookings for dissent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Wolves captain Ruben Neves appeared to suggest Lemina was carded due to being the third man to run up to ref Jarred Gillett
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It ties into the theory that the third man to run over to contest a ref's decision will automatically be booked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “What happens to the fourth, if there’s a fourth that attends the scene?” Ex-Premier League official Dermot Gallagher denied the "third man" rule after Lemina and Dias' bookings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That's what the referee is upset about there and it's nothing about being the third man there, it's all about players surrounding the referees
