                About Us Advertise PARIS, March 21 — The FIA said yesterday it intends to “address” the problems at last weekend’s Saudi Arabia Grand Prix where Fernando Alonso was handed a punishment at the end of the race that was later overturned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Spaniard crossed the line third in his Aston Martin on Sunday but was then handed a 10-second punishment that dropped him to fourth before a late-night appeal reinstated him

                He tried to serve his five-second penalty at the start of a pit stop, but a mechanic allowed a jack to touch the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the race finished and Alonso had stood on the podium and given interviews, the stewards, who are nominated by the FIA, finally decided that the team had been working on Alonso’s car during the penalty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They hit the Spaniard with a 10-second penalty, dropping him to fourth behind George Russell

                About Us Advertise PARIS, March 21 — The FIA said yesterday it intends to “address” the problems at last weekend’s Saudi Arabia Grand Prix where Fernando Alonso was handed a punishment at the end of the race that was later overturned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Spaniard crossed the line third in his Aston Martin on Sunday but was then handed a 10-second punishment that dropped him to fourth before a late-night appeal reinstated him

                He tried to serve his five-second penalty at the start of a pit stop, but a mechanic allowed a jack to touch the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the race finished and Alonso had stood on the podium and given interviews, the stewards, who are nominated by the FIA, finally decided that the team had been working on Alonso’s car during the penalty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They hit the Spaniard with a 10-second penalty, dropping him to fourth behind George Russell

                Trump supporters were scheduled to protest in America’s financial capital later yesterday, as a grand jury weighs an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg over the 2016 payment to Stormy Daniels

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 — Seven months after Loh Siew Hong cleared the first legal hurdle last year to challenge her three children’s unilateral conversion to Islam without her consent, the Hindu mother will finally have her day in court today and her case merits will be heard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In August, the High Court had granted Loh leave for her judicial review against the children’s unilateral conversion by her ex-husband without her consent and she is contesting that they were incapable of embracing Islam without her consent in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She is also seeking a declaration that the Perlis state’s legal provision that allows for one parent to unilaterally convert a child is unconstitutional
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under Order 53, rule 3(6) of the Rules of Court, an application for judicial review shall be made promptly and in any event within three months from the date when the grounds of the application first arose or when the decision is first communicated to the applicant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loh’s lawyer had then informed the court of their client’s discovery over the children’s conversion only when both sides reunited in February 2022, following which leave for the current judicial review bid was filed the following month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the June 2022 decision was set aside at the Court of Appeal in a three-judge panel’s unanimous decision in February this year, that would allow MAIP to file anew a bid to intervene for the purpose of varying a custody order granted to Loh.

                UBS' CEO Ralph Hamers told analysts that the decision to write down the AT1 bonds to zero was taken by FINMA, so it would not create a liability for the bank

                FINMA, the Swiss regulator, said the decision would bolster the bank's capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters reported earlier on Sunday that Swiss authorities were considering imposing losses on bondholders as part of the rescue deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                UBS' CEO Ralph Hamers told analysts that the decision to write down the AT1 bonds to zero was taken by FINMA, so it would not create a liability for the bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Credit Suisse's AT1 debt had rallied earlier on Sunday amid reports that shareholders would receive something in a deal with UBS, raising hopes that bondholders would be protected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move by the Swiss regulator could make it harder for other lenders to raise new AT1 debt, investors said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AT1s pay higher interest as they carry more risk for investors than regular debt

            <p>
                The new edition also comes with Toyota Safety Sense (TSS) which offers better safety features for both driver and passengers using advanced technology -- it alerts the driver of dangers and acts autonomously to prevent or avoid a collision

                Ravindran said the use of advanced technology in the assembly of the All-New Toyota Vios not only enhances the quality and efficiency of production but also promotes the upskilling of the workforce, fosters knowledge expansion within the industry and contributes positively to the local economy

            <p>
                said this is a testament to the popularity of the All-New Toyota Vios in the Malaysian market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manufactured at the Assembly Services Sdn Bhd in Bukit Raja, Klang, the new and highly anticipated model boasts of improved performance, quicker acceleration and new technology
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new edition also comes with Toyota Safety Sense (TSS) which offers better safety features for both driver and passengers using advanced technology -- it alerts the driver of dangers and acts autonomously to prevent or avoid a collision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ravindran said the use of advanced technology in the assembly of the All-New Toyota Vios not only enhances the quality and efficiency of production but also promotes the upskilling of the workforce, fosters knowledge expansion within the industry and contributes positively to the local economy

                When he later accepted a job at UBS, the move caused concern in Credit Suisse’s top ranks that he might poach key personnel

                In March 2021, Credit Suisse’s trading desk was informed that its biggest client wouldn’t be able to pay the more than US$2 billion it owed the next day

                Erik ten Hag's side have a knack for managing to win matches even when they aren't at their best, though their latest comeback win was more about Fulham's implosion than it was about their own ability on the day

                At the other end of the field, Antony was a thorn in Fulham's side, with his introduction helping to shift the momentum in United's favour even before the red card and penalty incident

            <p>

                Najib said Dr Mahathir should not be calling others a dictator when he himself was oppressive during his two tenures as prime minister in a post on his Facebook on Sunday (March 20) "Who was the one who enforced the Internal Security Act (ISA) and changed the country's Attorney General, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief and Chief Justice for his own benefit?" he asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib also pointed out a number of alleged injustices which the former premier faced under Dr Mahathir's administration, claiming a person could only be called a "dictator" when he has oppressed people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, former lawmaker Kasthuri Patto echoed the sentiment against Dr Mahathir claiming he had no moral authority to label Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim a dictator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kasthuri, who is the daughter of an Ops Lalang detainee, recalled how her late father was detained under the now-defunct ISA during the infamous operation in 1987 when Dr Mahathir served his first tenure as prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday (March 20), Dr Mahathir had denounced Anwar as an oppressive leader after his plan to hold a pro-Malay gathering failed to materialise.

                The 68-year-old Prayut, who cemented his rule in a controversial election in 2019, has demonstrated a longevity that is rare in Thai politics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in a poll published Sunday of who voters would like to see as PM, Prayut lagged in third place at just over 15 percent -- way behind front-runner Paetongtarn at 38 percent

            <p>
                In the same poll of 2,000 people, conducted by the National Institute of Development Administration, nearly 50 percent said they would vote Pheu Thai, with Prayut's United Thai Nation party on around 12 percent

                Bukayo Saka, Ben White and Manchester City feature in the Arsenal winners and losers from the 4-1 win over Crystal Palace

                Ben White A very close second though must be Ben White

                Arsenal also closed the goal difference to just two knowing the next gameweek features a home fixture for Mikel Arteta’s side against Leeds whilst City host Liverpool; it could change dramatically in a couple of weeks

                Emile Smith Rowe Although he got on later in the game, Emile Smith Rowe only got eleven minutes on the pitch

            <p>
                But with the European engagements over, getting time in this Arsenal side is a challenge that the England international might need to ride the storm of somewhat this season

                Gold prices dropped on Monday, with their safe-haven appeal diminished as risk sentiment improved after Swiss lender UBS sealed a deal to buy peer Credit Suisse in a rescue effort to stabilize global financial markets

                Indira Gandhi have filed a lawsuit against eight laws enabling unilateral conversion to Islam in seven states and Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the lawsuit, Indira and the 13 others are seeking for the High Court to declare the state enactments which allow the unilateral conversion of children into Islam as being void or invalid due to its breaching of the Federal Constitution, especially Article 12(4) and in light of the Federal Court’s 2018 decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other court orders that Indira and the 13 others are seeking include a declaration that the practice of unilateral conversion is unconstitutional and contrary to Article 12(4)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the High Court declares the state laws enabling unilateral conversion to be invalid and declares unilateral conversion to be an unconstitutional practice, Indira and the 13 others are seeking for a further declaration that any and all unilateral conversions that took place in Malaysia before the Federal Court’s January 2018 decision in Indira’s case to be void or invalid for breaching Article 12(4)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alternatively if the first two orders are granted, they want the court to require any and all unilateral conversions in Malaysia — after the Federal Court’s 2018 Indira decision — to require the consent of both parents, and to reverse the unilateral conversion of these children if either parent refuses to grant consent within a one-year period from the date of the court’s order in this lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aisyah cited the Federal Constitution’s Article 4(1) which states the Federal Constitution to be Malaysia’s supreme law and states that any law inconsistent with it shall be made void or invalid, and also cited Article 75 where the federal law will prevail if any state law is inconsistent with federal laws

                Analysts have widely downgraded their earnings forecasts for Top Glove, after the group posted a cumulative net loss of RM332 million for the first half ended Feb 28, 2023 (1HFY2023)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the second-quarter result announcement, the market consensus for Top Glove's annual net loss is now estimated at RM435 million for FY2023 — compared with an annual net loss of RM303 million prior to the release of the latest results
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, HLIB estimated the group to post a wider annual net loss of RM409.2 million for FY2023, from a projected RM274.2 million previously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                HLIB also expects Top Glove to continue bleeding in FY2024, with an annual net loss of RM66.3 million, against an estimated net profit of RM74.4 million previously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For FY2025, HLIB  expects the group to deliver a smaller annual net profit of RM174.3 million, against an estimated net profit of RM182 million previously

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 — Kepong MP Lim Lip Eng today announced he has already reached the RM2.25 million target which he was trying to crowdfund to pay for compensation and court-ordered costs for a defamation lawsuit against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Friday, Lim had on Facebook launched the fundraising effort to pay for the RM2 million compensation and RM250,000 legal costs, which the High Court had ordered him to pay to local company MonSpace (M) Sdn Bhd and its founder Datuk Seri Jessy Lai in a defamation lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim said he had been helping investment scam victims without fear over the years and had also tried in 2016 to help a group of individuals who asked him for help but ended up with a lawsuit where he was ordered to pay RM2.25 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Friday, Lim had promised to donate the entire sum to charitable and educational bodies when his appeal succeeds and the RM2.25 million sum is returned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When contacted by Malay Mail on Friday, Lim’s lawyer Guok Ngek Seong confirmed that an appeal had been filed on Thursday against the High Court’s decision and that preparations were being made to apply for a stay order to suspend the High Court order until the Court of Appeal decides on the appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim and Sungai Pelek assemblyman Ronnie Liu Tian Khiew had gone with 19 Chinese nationals, who claimed they were victims of the MonSpace investment scheme, to the company headquarters to demand a refund or an explanation on why their investment had not materialised.

                In a statement, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said the country's exports rose 9.8% to RM112.28bil on the back of strong exports of petroleum products, electrical and electronic (E&E) products and liquefied natural gas (LNG) Imports meanwhile increased 12.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM92.71bil, giving the country a trade surplus of RM19.56bil in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Miti, the growth in the country's exports was underpinned by a 14.8% y-o-y jump in shipments to Asean countries to RM33.69bil, led by a 27.7% increase in export value to Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This helped to offset a 6% y-o-y decline in export value to China to RM14.36bil on the back of lower exports of iron and steel products, petroleum products as well as chemicals and chemical products
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By export sector, manufactured goods, which account for 85% of total exports, rebounded 9.5% y-o-y to RM95.4bil on robust exports of petroleum products and E&E products
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The import of capital goods declined 0.3% y-o-y due to lower imports of non-transport capital goods and the import of consumption goods grew 1.2% y-o-y as a result of higher imports of primary food and beverages, mainly for household consumption.

                In a statement, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said the country's exports rose 9.8% to RM112.28bil on the back of strong exports of petroleum products, electrical and electronic (E&E) products and liquefied natural gas (LNG) Imports meanwhile increased 12.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM92.71bil, giving the country a trade surplus of RM19.56bil in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Miti, the growth in the country's exports was underpinned by a 14.8% y-o-y jump in shipments to Asean countries to RM33.69bil, led by a 27.7% increase in export value to Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This helped to offset a 6% y-o-y decline in export value to China to RM14.36bil on the back of lower exports of iron and steel products, petroleum products as well as chemicals and chemical products
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By export sector, manufactured goods, which account for 85% of total exports, rebounded 9.5% y-o-y to RM95.4bil on robust exports of petroleum products and E&E products
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The import of capital goods declined 0.3% y-o-y due to lower imports of non-transport capital goods and the import of consumption goods grew 1.2% y-o-y as a result of higher imports of primary food and beverages, mainly for household consumption.

                Off grid charging, charging times (takes <5 mins), battery tech being obsolete (you don't own the battery or *one* battery, battery degradation (self explanatory) and high initial purchase price (Battery as a service or subscription based model)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can still charge the battery yourself

                then there will be a mad rush on the new EV laws, taxes and what not !!! Two dislikes from those who will die on the ICE hill

                House officers at Sungai Buloh Hospital’s OB-GYN department accuse medical officers of perpetrating a “tradition” of bullying in the department, including sexual harassment, sexist slurs, and denial of annual leave and meal and rest breaks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a letter to CodeBlue last Wednesday, a complainant identifying as a representative of UD41 house officers in the public hospital’s OB-GYN department detailed allegations of everyday mistreatment against “all” housemen at the department by senior doctors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is not the first time Sungai Buloh Hospital has been hit with sexual harassment allegations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2018, an orthopaedic head of department in Sungai Buloh Hospital was terminated from public service, after the completion of an inquiry by a special investigation committee into female house officers’ sexual harassment allegations against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The majority (83 per cent) of house officers (64 people) who reported workplace bullying in CodeBlue’s survey are working at MOH hospitals, while 17 per cent work at university hospitals (13 people)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 41 per cent prevalence of workplace bullying among trainee doctors in CodeBlue’s poll is also more than five times higher than the 7.4 per cent reported in the Healthcare Work Culture Improvement Task Force (HWCITF) poll of over 110,000 respondents across 30 service schemes in the MOH

                Kawasaki's 400cc parallel-twin platform has proven to be quite a capable machine for both beginner and veteran riders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was essentially the evolution of the Ninja 250, and is the latest iteration of Team Green's parallel-twin engine design following the Ninja 300 platform released previously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What is happening, though, is Kawasaki's entry into the entry-level cruiser segment with the revival of the Eliminator nameplate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of now, the new bike is available only in Japan, and yes, it's built around the 400cc platform.  Kawasaki has launched the Eliminator 400 in the Japanese market in two versions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the new Eliminator 400 does share a few similarities with this bigger cruiser, it does have a style of its own, leaning towards a more retro aesthetic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That said, it does resemble the Honda Rebel 500 quite a bit, especially in its Spark Black Metallic colorway, and might be easily mistaken for Big Red's beginner-friendly cruiser.  The Kawasaki Eliminator 400 has some really friendly proportions, with a low seat height of just 735 millimeters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For reference, it retails for 759,000 Yen, around $5,732 USD, in standard trim

                MIDF Research said there was net foreign selling on every day of the week for an unbroken streak of 13 days since March 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sectors that saw net foreign inflows were construction (RM67.9mil), technology (RM13.2mil) and transport and logistics (RM7.8mil)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Local retailers meanwhile were net sellers over the week to the sum of RM29.7il
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Investor sentiment has been weak as the turmoil in the banking sector continued in the US and Switzerland, with seven of the eight Asian stock exchanges tracked by MIDF reporting net selling by foreign investors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Based on the provisional aggregate data for the eight exchanges that we track, investors classified as 'foreigners' net sold US$2.48bil worth of Asian equities last week, almost at the same pace as the week prior at -US$2.44bil," said MIDF in a weekly fund flow report

                Bruno Fernandes scored two impressive goals as Manchester United booked a FA Cup semi-final place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fernandes then rocketed an injury-time strike into the top corner to seal a 3-1 victory for Manchester United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fernandes has now overtaken two heroes of United’s last league winning team from a decade ago, Robin van Persie and Javier ‘Chicharito’ Hernandez
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had been level with Van Persie on 58, and one behind Hernandez on 59
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bruno Fernandes is now clear of both players on 60
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Marcus Rashford has precisely double Fernandes’ number, currently on 120 goals for the club, one short of Andy Cole.

            <p>
                The relationship between him and the boss, the minutes played, his motivation right now, it makes you think that the reasonable thing is that if there's an option that's good for the player, good for the club, we can look at it."

            <p>
                An overhaul is very much on the agenda for Liverpool in the coming months and — if the price is right — Félix has the subtle technical qualities to form part of Klopp's next great team.

            <p>
                As a matter of curiosity, I ran through ChatGPT the prompt “write me a few paragraphs about how ChatGPT is both the death knell and saviour of creativity in writing”

                If the Internet captures the sum of human knowledge to date, then ChatGPT represents a map of what we know as humankind

            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, I used to help people proofread some of their articles and emails, but now they use ChatGPT to do so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is known as the Turing Test, which a machine passes if it can hold a conversation with a human and the human cannot tell if it’s a human or computer on the other end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a matter of curiosity, I ran through ChatGPT the prompt “write me a few paragraphs about how ChatGPT is both the death knell and saviour of creativity in writing”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the Internet captures the sum of human knowledge to date, then ChatGPT represents a map of what we know as humankind

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin flew by helicopter to Mariupol, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the Nevsky district of Mariupol, a new residential neighbourhood built by Russian military, Putin visited a family in their home, Russian media reported
            </p>

                He said Penang DAP must help the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition to achieve a convincing win in the state, not just for Penangites but also for the country

            <p>
                “A convincing win in Penang would have the two-fold purpose of not only securing our children’s future and Penang as a symbol of good governance but also help to reinforce the stability of our unity government in Putrajaya under Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will last the full five-year term

                “These extremists and racists are willing to go to any length to gain power by hook or by crook,” said Lim in his speech at the Penang DAP Convention 2023 held at the Butterworth Arena in Butterworth, Penang today

                Lim said that only the unity government in Penang and Putrajaya can bring Malaysians together as one nation

                Lim, who is the former Penang chief minister, urged Penangites to uphold their constitutional rights regardless of race and religion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said it was their duty to prevent extremists from capturing the state government to ensure that only those who defend Penang’s sovereignty have the right to rule state

                According to the Financial Times newspaper, Switzerland’s largest bank UBS was negotiating to buy all or part of Credit Suisse, with the blessing of the Swiss regulators

                While waiting for Drainage and Irrigation Department (DID) Sarawak and the local councils to accept its plea to work together on the flood issue in Kuching, Kong said Dr Sim must also order for the mobilisation of personnel from local councils to ensure that immediate assistance is rendered to those stranded and those in need of help

                In response to a question on how her visit could strengthen bilateral ties between Singapore and Malaysia, the President stated that she will meet with the Agong and other important Malaysian officials during her stay to assess "our complete bilateral agenda, explore new areas of cooperation, and reiterate Singapore’s abiding interest to develop a stable, win-win partnership with Malaysia for the long-term." She also pointed to the digital and green economies as well as cybersecurity as agreed earlier by both sides as areas that can be developed and explored further to expand bilateral collaboration and cooperation

                But Blair rejects the notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin profited by defying a weakened West with his own aggression against Ukraine, starting in 2014 and extending to last year's full invasion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “At least you could say we were removing a despot and trying to introduce democracy,“ Blair said, speaking at the offices of his Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in central London
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So we should treat all that propaganda with the lack of respect it deserves.” Northern Ireland Fallout from the Iraq war arguably hampered Blair's own efforts as an international envoy to negotiate peace between Israel and the Palestinians, after he left office in 2007
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Through his institute, Blair maintains offices in the region and says he is “still very passionate” about promoting peace in the Middle East, even if it appears “pretty distant right now”

            <p>
                Blair, then Irish premier Bertie Ahern and an envoy of US president Bill Clinton spent three days and nights negotiating the final stretch before the agreement was signed on April 10, 1998

                About Us Advertise   SEREMBAN, March 18 — Umno will get cracking for the state election once its party election process for the 2023-2026 term is completed, said its deputy president, Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                five years with no election, many have become overaged
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Umno polls began on Feb 1 with the annual delegates conference and Umno divisional delegates elections, along with the election of Umno Supreme Council members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad said Umno Youth and Puteri also need to be given exposure and intensive training since they are among the party’s prime movers, in addition to having to be in sync with the machinery in managing the state polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Mohamad, who is also Umno’s election director, said they have yet to discuss the issue of seat distribution between BN and Pakatan Harapan (PH)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, in PENANG, state Umno liaison committee chairman Datuk Musa Sheikh Fadzir said they would discuss with the state’s PH leadership about the distribution of seats after the Umno Division Committee election is over

                About Us Advertise   SEREMBAN, March 18 — Umno will get cracking for the state election once its party election process for the 2023-2026 term is completed, said its deputy president, Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                five years with no election, many have become overaged
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Umno polls began on Feb 1 with the annual delegates conference and Umno divisional delegates elections, along with the election of Umno Supreme Council members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad said Umno Youth and Puteri also need to be given exposure and intensive training since they are among the party’s prime movers, in addition to having to be in sync with the machinery in managing the state polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Mohamad, who is also Umno’s election director, said they have yet to discuss the issue of seat distribution between BN and Pakatan Harapan (PH)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, in PENANG, state Umno liaison committee chairman Datuk Musa Sheikh Fadzir said they would discuss with the state’s PH leadership about the distribution of seats after the Umno Division Committee election is over

                Former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces fraud charges over the collapse of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, arrives for a hearing at a federal court in New York on Feb 9, 2023

            <p>
                Though the laptop would lack monitoring software or restrict Bankman-Fried's Internet access, a lawyer or paralegal would oversee his use and take the laptop away when Bankman-Fried finished with it, Everdell said.

                Following the sentencing of four main suspects in a syndicate that was busted during Op Tropicana, the MACC are now investigating claims of the involvement of these individuals

            <p>
                "They are made up of a group of 'professional enablers', including bank officers, accountants and company secretaries that have allowed the syndicate operations to proceed," the MACC said in a statement Saturday (March 18)

            <p>
                On Feb 21, the MACC with the cooperation of other agencies, including the Immigration Department, busted an investment syndicate masterminded by British citizens, following 24 raids and arrest of 81 suspects

            <p>

                A delegation for Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani's bid to buy Manchester United, and Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his entourage have both held in-depth meetings with club officials this week Both leading parties in the race to buy Manchester United are set to submit second offers to the Glazers next week after each holding positive meetings with club officials

                A Qatari delegation for Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani's bid visited Manchester on Thursday, spending 10 hours with United chiefs as they discussed a range of subjects in depth relating to both on and off the field matters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Greeted by United chief executive Richard Arnold at the players' entrance of Old Trafford just before 10am on Friday morning, Ratcliffe was joined by INEOS director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford, formerly the supremo of British Cycling and Team Sky
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sheikh Jassim, on the other hand, didn't make the visit and was instead chiefly represented by Shahzad Shahbaz, the president of his newly-formed Nine Two Foundation which is said be named after the year he began supporting United

                British citizens Lloyd George Bedwell, 48, and Roger Hoi Wing Hu, 46, pleaded guilty yesterday before Sessions judge Zulhazmi Abdullah after the two alternative charges were read to them in English by the court translator during the proceeding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was reported on Thursday that two other British nationals pleaded guilty at the Shah Alam Sessions Court to similar charges

                They pleaded guilty to inducing a Scottish man, Ian Strachan, to transfer £121,200 (RM579,249) into a CIMB Bank account belonging to Premier Transfers Ltd for a non-existent investment scheme
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Peters was ordered to pay a RM180,000 fine and was sentenced to an additional 22 months’ imprisonment should he fail to pay the fine, while McNicholas was ordered to pay a RM140,000 fine and faces an additional 16 months’ imprisonment should he fail to pay.

                Dividend stocks are the Swiss army knives of the stock market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When dividend stocks go up, you make money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Heck, even when a dividend stock goes down in price, it’s not all bad news, because the dividend yield (the absolute dividend amount, divided by the stock price) gets richer the more the stock falls in price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BXSL raised its common share regular dividend by 17%, to a new payment of 70 cents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was the third quarter in a row that the dividend was increased
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~27% potential total return profile

                Yesterday, a local media outlet reported that Mohamad Kamal claimed that Hannah used her minsterial powers to deny Kelantan the right to host 2024 Sukma
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kelantan is the only state that has yet to host Sukma
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The decision to make Kelantan the 2028 Sukma hosts is to give the state government additional time to complete sports infrastructure for the Games,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also conveyed his appreciation to Sarawak, who are ready to organise the 2024 Sukma following Johor’s decision to not host the Games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johor was supposed to host the 2020 edition, but it was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the state chose to host the 2024 edition, followed by the 2026 edition in Kelantan, while the NSC would host the 2022 edition in the Klang Valley last September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the latest decision by the Sukma Supreme Council has determined that Sarawak will host the 2024 edition, the NSC the 2026 edition, followed by Kelantan in 2028

                Yesterday, a local media outlet reported that Mohamad Kamal claimed that Hannah used her minsterial powers to deny Kelantan the right to host 2024 Sukma
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kelantan is the only state that has yet to host Sukma
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The decision to make Kelantan the 2028 Sukma hosts is to give the state government additional time to complete sports infrastructure for the Games,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also conveyed his appreciation to Sarawak, who are ready to organise the 2024 Sukma following Johor’s decision to not host the Games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johor was supposed to host the 2020 edition, but it was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the state chose to host the 2024 edition, followed by the 2026 edition in Kelantan, while the NSC would host the 2022 edition in the Klang Valley last September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the latest decision by the Sukma Supreme Council has determined that Sarawak will host the 2024 edition, the NSC the 2026 edition, followed by Kelantan in 2028

                The Thai Rice Exporter Association recently raised concerns and demanded solutions after a rice mill in China was found to be producing fake jasmine rice and using a Thai brand name to deceive customers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The President of the Thai Rice Exporter Association, Chukiat Opassawong, revealed in an interview with KhaoSod that the rice mill in China had been producing fake Thai jasmine rice by adding a flavouring agent and using Thai language on the packaging and branding

            <p>
                Thai jasmine rice, also known as Thai Hom Mali rice, is a type of long-grain rice that is considered one of the best in the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the World’s Best Rice event in Phuket last year, Paka Lamduan rice from Cambodia was named the world’s best rice in 2022, defeating Thai jasmine rice, which came in second place, followed by rice from Vietnam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a report on WorkPoint Today, the judge, an American chef, noted that both Thai and Cambodian rice had good qualities, but Cambodian rice offered a better aroma than Thai rice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Thai customers and farmers expressed concerns that the quality of Thai jasmine rice had declined due to the use of pesticides and chemical substances

                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa said that the 150-year-old hospital accommodates about 50,000 inpatient services at its wards each year, which reflects the commitment of its staff

                It is revealed during the briefing by HKL director Datin Paduka Dr Rohana Johan that the hospital still relies on the manual method to store about 16,000 patients' data in a day, which is stored at its Wisma Kayu

                More info Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has been urged to replace Wout Weghorst with Victor Osimhen this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United are set to be in the market for a striker this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tottenham's Harry Kane is a top target for Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Osimhen has been on fire for Napoli this season and is another target for United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At 24, he would be a longer-term option for United than 29-year-old Kane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst, meanwhile, turns 31 later this year

                More info Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has been urged to replace Wout Weghorst with Victor Osimhen this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United are set to be in the market for a striker this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tottenham's Harry Kane is a top target for Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Osimhen has been on fire for Napoli this season and is another target for United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At 24, he would be a longer-term option for United than 29-year-old Kane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst, meanwhile, turns 31 later this year

            <p>
                Bedwell, with Yazdi, contacted Walker on January 5 this year where she was similarly scammed into transferring A$8,573 into the same bank account number

                The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) conducted an operation on February 21 at several of the boiler rooms in Penang and Klang Valley where Bedwell and Hoi were arrested

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, March 17 — Crystal Palace sacked manager Patrick Vieira after 20 months in charge today after their 1-0 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion left them three points above the Premier League relegation zone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Palace are the only side in the league without a win in 2023, having drawn five and lost six of their games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Results in recent months have placed us in a precarious league position and we felt a change is necessary to give us the best chance of retaining Premier League status.” Former France international Vieira, who captained Arsenal to three league titles and four FA Cups as a player, took over from Roy Hodgson in July 2021 on a three-year contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wednesday’s defeat at Brighton was their third in a row and marked the 13th league game they failed to score
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Patrick has given his all to the club, and we all thank him and his team for their service.” Vieira also won the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European Championship as a player with France
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, March 17 — Crystal Palace sacked manager Patrick Vieira after 20 months in charge today after their 1-0 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion left them three points above the Premier League relegation zone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Palace are the only side in the league without a win in 2023, having drawn five and lost six of their games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Results in recent months have placed us in a precarious league position and we felt a change is necessary to give us the best chance of retaining Premier League status.” Former France international Vieira, who captained Arsenal to three league titles and four FA Cups as a player, took over from Roy Hodgson in July 2021 on a three-year contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wednesday’s defeat at Brighton was their third in a row and marked the 13th league game they failed to score
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Patrick has given his all to the club, and we all thank him and his team for their service.” Vieira also won the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European Championship as a player with France
            </p>
            
            <p>

                China's central bank said on Friday it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the first time this year to help keep liquidity ample and support a nascent economic recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for all banks, except those that have implemented a 5% reserve ratio, by 25 basis points (bps), effective March 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank said the cut reflected its intention to "make a good combination of macro policies, improve the level of services for the real economy, and keep liquidity reasonably sufficient in the banking system." The central bank has promised to make its policy "precise and forceful" this year to support the economy, keeping liquidity reasonably ample and lowering funding costs for businesses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The weighted average RRR for financial institutions stood at around 7.6% after the cut, the central bank said

                “Therefore, I wish to ask if this enactment will be applied on the country’s key leaders also if they visit these houses of worship? “As Muda president, I wish to call more than 100,000 Muda members to visit any houses of worship

                Syed Saddiq said that as an MP, he has also visited non-Muslim houses of worship because he represents everyone in his Johor constituency and does not look at their race, religion or political affiliations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syed Saddiq also noted that Mohd Zawawi had highlighted that the Selangor Islamic Religious Department (Jais) would take action on anyone who breaches the rules under Sections 5 and 6 of a 1988 Selangor state law and saying that the rules prohibit “any programme” involving Muslims at non-Muslims house of worship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Therefore, I wish to ask if this enactment will be applied on the country’s key leaders also if they visit these houses of worship? “As Muda president, I wish to call more than 100,000 Muda members to visit any houses of worship
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                For Selangor’s Non-Islamic Religions (Control of Propagation Amongst Muslims) Enactment 1988 which Mohd Zawawi referred to, Section 5 covers the offence of subject a Muslim minor to influences of a non-Islamic religion — including by persuading, influencing or encouraging the receiving of instruction in any non-Islamic religion or taking part in any non-Islamic religion’s religious activity or act of worship or taking part in any activity for the benefit of a non-Islamic religion organised by non-Islamic religion bodies or institutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Section 6 covers the offence of approaching a Muslim to subject him to any speech on or display of any matter concerning a non-Islamic religion

                “Malaysia wishes to note that the stay order granted on July 12, 2022, is an exceptional decision and serves to reinforce Malaysia’s position that the purported commercial arbitration instituted by the Sulu claimants is without legitimate basis and does affect Malaysia’s territorial sovereignty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In February last year, the Paris Court of Arbitration through arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa ordered Malaysia to pay US$14.9bil to the self-proclaimed heirs of the Sulu Sultanate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stampa, who was stopped by Spanish courts from hearing the case, had moved the arbitration to Paris to make his decision in Paris
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Malaysia managed to obtain a stay order on Stampa’s controversial award from French courts after filing a request for a stay of the enforcement of the purported final award in April 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Subsequently, on July 12, 2022, the pre-trial judge of the Paris Court of Appeal ordered the unconditional stay of enforcement in France of the purported final award pending the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal on the set-aside proceedings, on the ground that it will likely affect Malaysia’s territorial sovereignty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 27, 2022, the Sulu claimants filed a challenge against the stay order, to which the hearing on the merits was held on Jan 16, 2023.

                The earlier figure was derived from mandatory retrenchment notifications that firms could submit ahead of planned job cuts, a Ministry of Manpower spokesman said on Wednesday at a briefing on the finalised fourth quarter labour market report

                The Pentagon said the drone was on a routine mission when it was intercepted — a term that refers to one aircraft making visual or electronic contact with another — in a “reckless” and “unprofessional manner.” The incident has ratcheted up tensions between Moscow and Western allies, already soaring over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but top security officials from the United States and Russia have been in touch

                — Bernama TRACKING, or non-physical stalking, will be an offence, just as physically stalking a person is an offence under amendments to the law, says Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also amended is Section 98A under the CPC, which will empower the court to issue a protection order against a person who is being investigated for, or is charged with, an offence of stalking under the new Section 507A
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 4 last year, the last administration tabled Bills to amend the Penal Code and the CPC to fill the lacuna in the anti-sexual harassment law which was passed by the Dewan Rakyat the month before

            <p>
                The anti-sexual harassment law dealt with offences in a civil manner, requiring further amendments to criminalise stalking as an offence

                — Bernama TRACKING, or non-physical stalking, will be an offence, just as physically stalking a person is an offence under amendments to the law, says Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also amended is Section 98A under the CPC, which will empower the court to issue a protection order against a person who is being investigated for, or is charged with, an offence of stalking under the new Section 507A
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 4 last year, the last administration tabled Bills to amend the Penal Code and the CPC to fill the lacuna in the anti-sexual harassment law which was passed by the Dewan Rakyat the month before
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The anti-sexual harassment law dealt with offences in a civil manner, requiring further amendments to criminalise stalking as an offence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the sexual harassment law, a victim can request for a public apology and paid compensation

                MANCHESTER CITY star Julian Alvarez has signed a new long-term contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For a club like City to put their faith in me like this is amazing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I know I can be better, and City offer me everything I need to fulfil my potential
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I am now focused on getting better and helping City win trophies.” Alvarez joined City in a £17million deal last summer and has mostly acted as an understudy to the prolific Erling Haaland

                Sam’s case will be heard in the Court of Appeal on March 31
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Court of Appeal has been informed in a video-conference during case management this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the prosecution appealed this verdict and in 2019, High Court judge Shahnaz Sulaiman sent the case back to the Magistrate’s Court for Sam to enter her defence on the reckless driving charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Magistrate Siti Hajar Ali, who heard the case in 2019 again discharged and acquitted Sam at the end of the defence case, prompting the prosecution to file a second appeal to the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sam obtained leave from the Court of Appeal last April 18 to appeal against her conviction and jail sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Court of Appeal had also allowed Sam’s application to stay the execution of the jail sentence and released her on bail of RM10,000 with one surety pending the appeal hearing.

                banker Roger Ng (pic), who was sentenced to 10 years in prison last week for his role in the 1MDB fraud, is claiming he can’t meet US prosecutors’ demand that he also pay US$35mil (RM157mil) because the Malaysian government already took all of his money

                The first prediction is that mortgage rates could fall if the Federal Reserve backs off from future rate hikes, which Olsen writes "appeared imminent just weeks ago." Already, financial markets have pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.75%—down from last week's peak of 7.05%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the Fed doesn't issue a rate hike in March, some analysts think mortgage rates would sink even further
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For buyers shopping now—especially in high-priced areas—a sustained rate drop will be a welcome boost to affordability, but they should still plan on rate volatility." That said, if Silicon Valley Bank's collapse forewarns of a looming 2023 recession, Olsen writes the affordability gains from lower mortgage rates could be muted by economic pain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank, Olsen predicts, might mean more pain awaits tech-dominated housing markets like San Francisco, Boise, and Seattle

                Thursday Mar 16, 2023  Credit Suisse said on Thursday it would borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence, after a slump in its shares had intensified fears about a global banking crisis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Switzerland's second-largest bank said it would exercise an option to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the central bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That followed assurances from Swiss authorities on Wednesday that Credit Suisse met "the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks" and that it could access central bank liquidity if needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The concerns about Credit Suisse added to broader banking sector fears sparked by last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, two US mid-size firms

                Similar to Malaysia's revision, there will be a standard toll fare for all days as there is no peak or off-peak rate offered anymore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Feb 25, 2023, PLUS Malaysia Bhd announced on its website that it will reinstate the Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza off-peak rate back to the original standard toll fare from March 1, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PLUS said the off-peak hour toll rates were introduced in 2018 at the Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza as part of a move to encourage the public to utilise the toll plaza to exit and enter Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that based on data, the number of daily vehicles at the Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza remained identical to the traffic volume recorded before the off-peak hour toll rates were offered
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There has been no significant increase in traffic during off-peak hours at the Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza till today," it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PLUS noted that traffic statistics also indicate that more than 50% of the vehicles during off-peak hours at the Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza are Singapore-registered vehicles

                Similar to Malaysia's revision, there will be a standard toll fare for all days as there is no peak or off-peak rate offered anymore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Feb 25, 2023, PLUS Malaysia Bhd announced on its website that it will reinstate the Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza off-peak rate back to the original standard toll fare from March 1, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PLUS said the off-peak hour toll rates were introduced in 2018 at the Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza as part of a move to encourage the public to utilise the toll plaza to exit and enter Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that based on data, the number of daily vehicles at the Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza remained identical to the traffic volume recorded before the off-peak hour toll rates were offered
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There has been no significant increase in traffic during off-peak hours at the Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza till today," it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PLUS noted that traffic statistics also indicate that more than 50% of the vehicles during off-peak hours at the Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza are Singapore-registered vehicles

                Judge Ahmad Murad Abdul Aziz in his decision on Thursday (March 16) said having read the affidavits and considered the submissions made, the companies failed to prove there are special circumstances for the court to grant the stay of the winding-up order issued on Jan 10, pending their appeal

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 — The Terengganu Election Court today issued an arrest warrant for its state executive councillor Mohd Nor Hamzah, reportedly for not turning up to continue his testimony as a witness in an election petition case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                High Court judge Datuk Hassan Abdul Ghani, who was sitting as an election judge, then gave the order for the arrest warrant, Harian Metro reported
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hearing for the election petition will now resume on March 19
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On January 3, Terengganu Umno had filed the election petition and sought to have the GE15 results for the Marang seat nullified
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On February 12 this year, the Election Court dismissed Hadi’s preliminary objection to the election petition on the Marang seat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hearing of the election petition was then scheduled for March 6 to March 21.

                Quarter-on-quarter, losses narrowed slightly for the quarter under review versus RM168.24 million for 1QFY2023.  The dismal quarterly results dragged the group’s performance for the first six months of FY2023 to a net loss of RM332.90 million, against a net profit of RM273.27 million a year earlier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Half-year revenue declined 58.2% to RM1.25 billion, from RM3.09 billion previously.  In a separate statement, Top Glove said the group’s financial performance continued to be impacted by headwinds that had weighed heavily on the glove industry.  “Destocking activity persisted, driven by excess customer inventories, resulting in a softer order book
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the glove industry faces losses, coupled with escalating costs, the industry has started to revise selling prices upward from February 2023, which is a necessary step towards the industry’s eventual recovery and sustainability,” it added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, he expects the challenging and competitive business landscape to endure through 2023.  However, the group takes a long-term view of industry prospects, which are still promising.  Top Glove managing director Lim Cheong Guan observed that the glove industry had been experiencing an extremely challenging past one year, owing to the perfect storm of rebalancing demand and supply, coupled with softer ASPs and cost increases.  “The financial results delivered are not representative of actual potential of the company or the industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nonetheless, we believe that the glove industry will recover in due course, as its fundamentals remain robust and unchanged
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We believe that it will be a matter of time, before our results are more reflective of the glove industry’s potential,” he concluded.  At the midday break on Thursday (March 16), Top Glove's share price had risen two sen or 2.86% to 72 sen, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM5.91 billion

                Half-year revenue declined 58.2% to RM1.25 billion, from RM3.09 billion previously.  In a separate statement, Top Glove said the group’s financial performance continued to be impacted by headwinds that had weighed heavily on the glove industry.  “Destocking activity persisted, driven by excess customer inventories, resulting in a softer order book
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the glove industry faces losses, coupled with escalating costs, the industry has started to revise selling prices upward from February 2023, which is a necessary step towards the industry’s eventual recovery and sustainability,” it added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, he expects the challenging and competitive business landscape to endure through 2023.  However, the group takes a long-term view of industry prospects, which are still promising.  Top Glove managing director Lim Cheong Guan observed that the glove industry had been experiencing an extremely challenging past one year, owing to the perfect storm of rebalancing demand and supply, coupled with softer ASPs and cost increases.  “The financial results delivered are not representative of actual potential of the company or the industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nonetheless, we believe that the glove industry will recover in due course, as its fundamentals remain robust and unchanged
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We believe that it will be a matter of time, before our results are more reflective of the glove industry’s potential,” he concluded.  At the midday break on Thursday (March 16), Top Glove's share price had risen two sen or 2.86% to 72 sen, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM5.91 billion

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 — PAS secretary-general Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan today accused Youth and Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh of trying to drive a wedge within the Opposition Perikataan Nasional (PN) coalition with her recent remarks in Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Yeoh’s references of past visits to temples and churches made by his party president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang and deputy president Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man were out of context
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Takiyuddin claimed Yeoh had a “motive” for pitting the two PN parties against each other, and that was made clear when she did not allow representatives either from PAS or Bersatu to respond to her remarks in the Dewan Rakyat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was reported to have said that “Christian evangelist has started its work” in a slight aimed at Yeoh, a practising Christian
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During her ministerial explanation, Yeoh said that Tuan Ibrahim had remarked back in 2018 that Muslims were permitted to visit temples and churches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yeoh who is a second-term Segambut MP has since lodged a police report through her political secretary against Badrul Hisham.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 — A court order from the Paris Court of Appeal to stay or temporarily block a group of purported Sulu “heirs” from claiming US$14.9 billion (RM67 billion) from Malaysia still remains intact, as the Sulu claimants had failed in their challenge against this court order, a special secretariat said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement today by Malaysia's special secretariat dealing with the Sulu claimants' matter, it gave updates on Malaysia's success so far in getting the Paris courts to block the purported Sulu heirs from enforcing a US$14.9 billion arbitration award
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The secretariat explained that Malaysia had filed a request in Paris on April 15, 2022, for a stay of the enforcement of Stampa's purported US$14.9 billion final award, and had later succeeded in getting the stay order
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Sulu claimants on July 27, 2022 then filed a challenge against the stay order, and the Paris Court of Appeal had a hearing on this challenge on January 16 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the January hearing, the secretariat said the Paris Court of Appeal had dismissed the Sulu claimants' bid to enforce the US$14.9 billion award, by rejecting the Sulu claimants' bid to challenge the stay order
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The secretariat indicated the Paris Court of Appeal's July 2022 stay order is a recognition that Malaysia's sovereignty was affected by the Sulu claimants' purported arbitration

            <p>

                Subsequently, on July 12, 2022, the pre-trial judge of the Paris Court of Appeal ordered the unconditional stay of enforcement in France of the purported Final Award pending the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal on the set-aside proceedings, on the ground that it will likely affect Malaysia’s territorial sovereignty

                On July 27, 2022, the Sulu claimants filed a challenge against the stay order, to which the hearing on the merits was held on Jan 16, 2023.

                About Us Advertise MADRID, March 16 — Karim Benzema struck for Real Madrid to clinch a 1-0 win over Liverpool and qualification for the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday 6-2 on aggregate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Madrid have now knocked Liverpool out of the Champions League in three consecutive seasons, including beating them in last year’s final
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the first leg, Madrid were lethal, with Vinicius Junior and Benzema netting twice each — neither had their shooting boots on in the Spanish capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the other end Madrid sliced open Liverpool but Toni Kroos could not find Benzema, back after missing the win over Espanyol in La Liga on Saturday with an ankle problem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Benzema is key to Madrid’s bid to lift the trophy for a sixth time in 10 seasons, if he can stay fit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Madrid played classic Liverpool anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone at the end of the game, at once a classy touch but also showing Liverpool never made them truly uncomfortable

                About Us Advertise MADRID, March 16 — Karim Benzema struck for Real Madrid to clinch a 1-0 win over Liverpool and qualification for the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday 6-2 on aggregate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Madrid have now knocked Liverpool out of the Champions League in three consecutive seasons, including beating them in last year’s final
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the first leg, Madrid were lethal, with Vinicius Junior and Benzema netting twice each — neither had their shooting boots on in the Spanish capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the other end Madrid sliced open Liverpool but Toni Kroos could not find Benzema, back after missing the win over Espanyol in La Liga on Saturday with an ankle problem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Benzema is key to Madrid’s bid to lift the trophy for a sixth time in 10 seasons, if he can stay fit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Madrid played classic Liverpool anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone at the end of the game, at once a classy touch but also showing Liverpool never made them truly uncomfortable
            </p>

                In the “People Power Under Attack 2022” report by global research collaboration CIVICUS Monitor, which tracks fundamental freedoms in 197 countries and territories, Malaysia is one of seven countries in the Asia region rated as having an “obstructed” civic space

            <p>
                The “obstructed” category is the middle grade for how well a country respects the freedom of speech, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association

                Why is Malaysia's civic space 'obstructed'? Commenting on Malaysia's “obstructed” rating, CIVICUS Monitor said it had documented the continued use of restrictive laws to silence dissent in the country, as well as restrictions on protests and harassment of peaceful protesters

                A reported Liverpool move to sign Josko Gvardiol could see Nat Phillips join West Ham United in the summer transfer window

            <p>
                According to a report from The Athletic, the 21-year-old RB Leipzig ace joining Liverpool will help West Ham get a deal for the 25-year-old Reds centre-back over the line in the summer transfer window

            <p>
                And with a Premier League move beckoning for the defender, West Ham fans will be keeping a keen eye on which club he joins in the summer transfer window… The Athletic reckon that the door could be open for the Hammers to sign the 25-year-old defender, if the Croatian ends up moving to Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moyes is a big fan of Phillips, and has tried to sign him on a few occasions previously

                Aviation ranking website Skytrax unveiled its annual list of the world's top 20 best airports on Wednesday, and last year's winner has been dethroned by Singapore Changi Airport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Skytrax, its results are determined via global customer satisfaction surveys of over 550 airports that rank things like food and retail options, security, terminal layout, comfort, seating, and WiFi.  The website describes the awards as a "quality benchmark for the world airport industry" and said the "survey and awards are independent of any airport control, influence or input." The questionnaires were collected from August 2022 to February 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Changi Airport is honoured to be named World's Best Airport for the 12th time," Changi CEO Lee Seow Hiang said in a press release
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taking second this year is Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Vancouver International Airport came in at numbers 18 and 20, barely making the list
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In fact, Seattle once again won the award for being North America's best airport, and LaGuardia's Terminal B won "world's best new airport terminal." Take a closer look at the world's top 20 airports of 2023

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, March 16 — The latest round of job cuts at Meta have led some workers in the technology field here, including one Apple employee, to fear for their job security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking to TODAY on Wednesday (March 15), a 33-year-old contract worker with tech firm Apple said that although the company has assured the teams that there will not be job cuts, employees such as herself remain worried about their future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What workers say The contract worker from Apple’s office in Singapore said that the spate of layoffs in the industry have been “on everyone’s minds”, with their worries further exacerbated by Meta’s latest move
            </p>

            <p>
                A TikTok employee in her 20s said that she was “not too worried” about her job security because she had “grown numb” to all the news about layoffs in the sector since late last year

                The 1GW of electricity imports can power up to all households (about 1.4 million) for a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Energy Market Authority (EMA) said on Thursday that electricity retailer Keppel Energy has received conditional approval to import hydropower, solar and potentially wind power from Cambodia’s Royal Group Power Company via new subsea cables that would transmit the electricity over more than 1,000km
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Republic has a target of importing 4GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which will make up about 30 per cent of Singapore’s projected energy supply in the same year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The project with Cambodia would be supplemented by battery energy storage systems to store excess wind and solar power, as well as pumped storage hydropower, which acts like a giant battery to store power and release it when needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The project is expected to start after 2030

                The 1GW of electricity imports can power up to all households (about 1.4 million) for a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Energy Market Authority (EMA) said on Thursday that electricity retailer Keppel Energy has received conditional approval to import hydropower, solar and potentially wind power from Cambodia’s Royal Group Power Company via new subsea cables that would transmit the electricity over more than 1,000km
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Republic has a target of importing 4GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which will make up about 30 per cent of Singapore’s projected energy supply in the same year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The project with Cambodia would be supplemented by battery energy storage systems to store excess wind and solar power, as well as pumped storage hydropower, which acts like a giant battery to store power and release it when needed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The project is expected to start after 2030

            <p>
                As for being as inexpensive as a Polo, Volkswagen expects a starting price of less than 25,000 Euros for the production Volkswagen ID.2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Germany, the Polo starts from 20,830 Euros, while the Golf starts from 31,145 Euros, so they’re right in the sense that a production ID.2 would be priced around a specced up Polo

            <p>
                Volkswagen probably intends this to be a replacement for the Golf in an electric future, and to make the connection to the iconic nameplate they say they have given the ID.2 a C-pillar design that is a throwback to the iconic Volkswagen Golf Mk1

                The findings were an improvement, though, to figures recorded in last year’s report, where 45 per cent agreed with the statement on lack of civility and 49 per cent agreed with that on the weakening social fabric

                Compared with the average of 53 per cent of respondents in other countries who said that their countries were more divided today than in the past, only 33 per cent of Singapore respondents said so

                In Singapore, nearly half, or 44 per cent, of respondents believed that the lack of civility and mutual respect today had hit rock-bottom, while 46 per cent believed that the social fabric that once held this country together had grown too weak

                KUALA NERUS, 15 Mac -- Presiden UMNO yang juga Timbalan Perdana Menteri Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi menyampaikan ucapan pada Majlis Pengenalan Calon-Calon Naib Presiden dan Majlis Kerja Tertinggi (MKT) bagi pemilihan UMNO 2023-2026 di sebuah hotel hari ini.

                KUALA NERUS, 15 Mac -- Presiden UMNO yang juga Timbalan Perdana Menteri Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi menyampaikan ucapan pada Majlis Pengenalan Calon-Calon Naib Presiden dan Majlis Kerja Tertinggi (MKT) bagi pemilihan UMNO 2023-2026 di sebuah hotel hari ini.

                Total overhang value also shrank 19.2% y-o-y to RM18.41 billion, from RM22.79 billion during the same period, according to the National Property Information Centre (Napic) in its Property Market Report 2022 released on Wednesday (March 15)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The previous low was in 2020, where 29,565 residential units were unsold after one year of completion, with a total value of RM18.92 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, while properties priced above RM1 million only constitute 13.6% of the total overhang, the segment contributes to the highest value at RM7.5 billion or about 40.7% of the total overhang units value, according to Napic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The residential sub-sector led the overall property market activity, having contributed 62.5% or 243,190 transactions to a total property transaction volume of 389,107 transactions posted last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The segment also recorded a total transaction value of RM94.28 billion, accounting for 52.6% of the total property transaction value of RM179.07 billion

                Kok, who was primary industries minister from 2018 to early 2020, had suggested that the ministry and Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigate the actual cost of the book, which was launched in January last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A total of 210,060 copies of the book were printed for distribution to primary schools at a cost of RM2.79mil and 62,475 copies for secondary schools at RM1.2mil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average cost per book worked out to RM13.28 for the primary school version and RM19.20 for the secondary school edition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kok told a press conference earlier that she was not against the publication and distribution of books to schools to create awareness of the benefits of palm oil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, she questioned the cost of printing the books and said a probe should be carried out to determine the actual cost of publication and distribution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She claimed that several printers she checked with told her that the cost of printing was about RM3 per copy.

                Kok, who was primary industries minister from 2018 to early 2020, had suggested that the ministry and Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigate the actual cost of the book, which was launched in January last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A total of 210,060 copies of the book were printed for distribution to primary schools at a cost of RM2.79mil and 62,475 copies for secondary schools at RM1.2mil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average cost per book worked out to RM13.28 for the primary school version and RM19.20 for the secondary school edition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kok told a press conference earlier that she was not against the publication and distribution of books to schools to create awareness of the benefits of palm oil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, she questioned the cost of printing the books and said a probe should be carried out to determine the actual cost of publication and distribution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She claimed that several printers she checked with told her that the cost of printing was about RM3 per copy.

                When the respondents were asked to explain why they preferred to stay, researchers found that pricing and rental affordability in the private housing sector was a major factor — PPR dwellers have “extremely limited options” to buy or rent outside the social housing market because they cannot afford to

            <p>
                One of the major ramifications of having a private housing market that is mostly unaffordable is that more Malaysians, including those a bit better-off than current PPR dwellers, could be forced to rely on social housing in the future, when the objective of PPR housing was completely the opposite
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PPRs, a programme that combined two social housing projects launched in 2002, was meant to offer transitory shelter for urban squatters with the hope that they would eventually afford to own or rent homes in the private market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means a good social housing policy should provide decent lives and transition homes for the underprivileged, or security of tenancy and stability that supports a good quality of life, a platform to help the poor take up education or employment and facilitate a transition from social housing to affordable housing or tenancy in the private rental market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A good social housing policy should also go beyond just focusing on the poor, the think tank said

                "There is little merit in housing policies that solely focuses on the poor in the hope that 'the market' will take care of the rest, without ensuring the proper functioning of the market," it said.

                About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, March 15 — The Election Court today struck out Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Masyarakat president Datuk Peter Anthony’s election petition against Tenom MP Reduan Rubin Balang for failing to prove there was any breach of procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Dean Wayne Daly ruled that Peter’s election petition did not comply with Rule 4(1)(b) of the Election Petition Rules, read with Section 32(b) of the Election Offences Act, and struck out the petition with costs of RM 20,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The judge had also ruled that Peter was a convicted criminal under Article 48(1)(e) at the time of nomination and was therefore disqualified under Article 48(5) of the Federal Constitution from contesting in GE15.” Peter is also Melalap assemblyman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Peter’s lawyer Datuk Ansari Abdullah, argued that Article 48(5) did not apply to his client because he had obtained a stay of conviction from the Sessions Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is irrelevant that there has been a stay of conviction because a stay only suspends the effects of conviction — it does not cause the conviction to disappear’ said Fuad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On November 5, a riot broke out at the nomination centre in Tenom after Peter’s nomination papers were rejected on Nomination Day for the 15th general election last year

                According to Berita Harian, Uqasha and her husband were chatting with a wheelchair-bound fan at around 9pm during a fan-meet at the Singapore Expo when a man called out to Kamal and beat him on the head with a baton

                Kamal was badly hurt

            <p>
                I saw Kamal getting up because he wanted to know who attacked him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kamal, 36, is currently recuperating at a hospital in Singapore and has regained consciousness yesterday after his head surgery
