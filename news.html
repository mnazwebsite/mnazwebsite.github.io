                When Is an RMD in Year of Death Required? If you inherit an IRA or another tax-advantaged account that’s subject to RMDs, the timing determines whether you’re required to take an RMD in the year of death
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Table I (Single Life Expectancy) is used when the beneficiary is not the spouse of the IRA owner
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For RMDs in the year following the account owner’s death, distribution calculations will depend on who is the beneficiary of the account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What If You Don’t Take an RMD in Year of Death? The deadline for taking RMDs in the year of death is December 31st of the year in which the original account owner passes away
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you inherit an IRA or 401(k) and fail to take the RMD for the year of the account owner’s death, a 50% tax penalty applies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You have 10 years following the original account owner’s death to do so

                When Is an RMD in Year of Death Required? If you inherit an IRA or another tax-advantaged account that’s subject to RMDs, the timing determines whether you’re required to take an RMD in the year of death
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Table I (Single Life Expectancy) is used when the beneficiary is not the spouse of the IRA owner
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For RMDs in the year following the account owner’s death, distribution calculations will depend on who is the beneficiary of the account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What If You Don’t Take an RMD in Year of Death? The deadline for taking RMDs in the year of death is December 31st of the year in which the original account owner passes away
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you inherit an IRA or 401(k) and fail to take the RMD for the year of the account owner’s death, a 50% tax penalty applies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You have 10 years following the original account owner’s death to do so

                The Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform) said the court described the claimants’ conduct of voluntarily omitting their real addresses from their filings as constituting a "manifestly illicit hardship” that was detrimental to Malaysia

            <p>
                According to Azalina, Malaysia had applied to the District Court of Luxembourg to obtain interim relief to release the attachment and the hearing took place on Dec 5
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azalina stressed that the government would be unrelenting in its efforts to protect and preserve Malaysia’s interests, sovereign immunity and sovereignty at all times, and continue to take all necessary action to put an end to the claimants’ fictitious claim

                Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Aziz at the Shopee headquarters in Singapore on Jan 29, 2023

            <p>
                Shopee is the largest pan-regional e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan.  Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tengku Zafrul Aziz announced this move during his official visit to the company’s headquarters in Singapore on Sunday (Jan 29).  Sea's decision to expand its investment footprint in Malaysia reflects the company’s confidence in the prospects, as well as the operational and policy stability of the country’s business landscape, he added.  During the minister's visit, Sea shared its proposed expansion plans in Malaysia, involving the setting up of cloud computing services, data hosting and processing, as well as a new logistics e-commerce warehouse.  The cloud computing project will be located in a three-storey green facility in the Johor town of Kulai, said Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 29 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will undertake his first official visit to Singapore tomorrow (Jan 30) at the invitation of his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong

            <p>
                The Malaysian Foreign Ministry (Wisma Putra), in a statement, said Anwar – in his maiden visit to the republic after being sworn in as the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia – will be meeting President Halimah Yacob and Lee
            </p>

            <p>
                The statement said the visit reflects the importance of the Malaysia-Singapore ties as close neighbours and partners in Asean
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar will be accompanied by his wife, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, and the delegation will comprise foreign affairs minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, Minister of Transport Anthony Loke Siew Fook, Minister of International Trade and Industry Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, Minister of Communications and Digital Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil, and officials from the relevant ministries and agencies

                Mohamed Salah has struggled to produce his best form for Liverpool this season It's not just Saturday, since the World Cup or even this season that Salah has looked a little off form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This time Salah did take a spot-kick - but crucially he missed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The end result right now though is Salah's source for chances is not delivering the goods like it once did
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Granted, he isn't quite man-marked out of game given his modest goals record this season but Liverpool's often relatively ponderous attacking build up is detrimental to Salah's game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp's tactics this term have forced Salah out to the right and have limited the forward Salah's drop in form could also come from a factor that no footballer can beat..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah's run of four league games without goal contributions is his worst run for two years That's not to say Salah is finished - far from it

                Mohamed Salah has struggled to produce his best form for Liverpool this season It's not just Saturday, since the World Cup or even this season that Salah has looked a little off form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This time Salah did take a spot-kick - but crucially he missed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The end result right now though is Salah's source for chances is not delivering the goods like it once did
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Granted, he isn't quite man-marked out of game given his modest goals record this season but Liverpool's often relatively ponderous attacking build up is detrimental to Salah's game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp's tactics this term have forced Salah out to the right and have limited the forward Salah's drop in form could also come from a factor that no footballer can beat..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah's run of four league games without goal contributions is his worst run for two years That's not to say Salah is finished - far from it
            </p>

                Three quick-fire second-half goals allowed Manchester United to ease to a 3-1 win over Championship side Reading in Saturday's FA Cup fourth round tie at Old Trafford

                After a frustrating first half, Casemiro struck twice in four minutes before the hour mark to put United on the path to victory

                The goal was an all-Brazilian affair with Antony supplying a perfectly weighted through ball and Casemiro finishing with a delicate chip over the out-rushing Joe Lumley in the Reading goal

                Man United defender Harry Maguire heaped special praise on Casemiro after their FA Cup win over Reading
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, Casemiro fired home a brilliant second, bending home a delicious effort from outside the penalty area, ahead of substitute Fred flicking the ball home from close range to make it 3-0
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In and out of possession he has really improved us." Victory over the Royals marked United's 11th successive win on their own patch, meaning you have to go back to the goalless draw with Newcastle United on October 16 for the last time they failed to win at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We have definitely not won 11 on the spin [at home] since I have been here," added Maguire, addressing the Reds' brilliant home form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "You have got to make your home a fortress; it is really important
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The first-half was relentless without the goal and we controlled the game from then on

                Meor Azuan Hassan celebrates Shello Silverius' goal during their game against Japan at the Birsa Munda Stadium in Rourkela
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wily midfielder Shello Silverius was the toast with two goals in the seventh and 31st minute to end his World Cup campaign with three goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan's goals were scored by Kaito Tanaka (23rd minute) and Seren Tanaka (31st)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means Malaysia will end their World Cup in 13th, an improvement compared to their 2018 outing, where they were booted out of the group stages and finished 15th.

                Meor Azuan Hassan celebrates Shello Silverius' goal during their game against Japan at the Birsa Munda Stadium in Rourkela
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wily midfielder Shello Silverius was the toast with two goals in the seventh and 31st minute to end his World Cup campaign with three goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan's goals were scored by Kaito Tanaka (23rd minute) and Seren Tanaka (31st)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means Malaysia will end their World Cup in 13th, an improvement compared to their 2018 outing, where they were booted out of the group stages and finished 15th.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 28 — The real threat to the survival of the ethnic Malay community and Malaysia as a whole is corruption as well as leaders who steal the country’s wealth, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today
            </p>
            
            <p>

                It's a way and attempt by political leaders to disguise and hijack the central issues of governance in this country

                “Now my answer to that question is, it is not being challenged by Malay businessmen or Chinese businessmen or Indian businessmen or Sabah, Sarawak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malay survival is being threatened by a corrupt system, a greedy coterie of leaders who have been stealing public funds from this country, so we will have to continue to work together to make sure we save this country from corruption,” he said in his keynote speech at the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia's (ACCCIM) Chinese New Year open house here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his speech, Anwar also alluded to ACCCIM president Tan Sri Low Kian Chuan’s earlier speech on issues of good governance and a firm commitment and determination to wipe out corruption which had become systemic and endemic in Malaysia

                Indian billionaire Gautam Adani addresses delegates during the Bengal Global Business Summit in Kolkata, India on Apr 20, 2022

            <p>
                Adani was born in Ahmedabad to a middle-class family but dropped out of school at 16 and moved to the financial capital Mumbai to find work in the lucrative gems trade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani is seen as an acolyte of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow Gujarat native, and has aligned his own business interests with those of "nation building"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adani batted away press freedom fears, but told the Financial Times that journalists should have the "courage" to say "when the government is doing the right thing every day"

            <p>

                What may be surprising, however, is that a popular recent answer to that retirement amount question — Fidelity Investments’ counsel to sock away 10 times your current annual income by age 67 — may be one of the most misleading pieces of advice on the retirement web
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But some financial experts believe Fidelity’s 10 times guidance undershoots the real cost of retirement

            <p>
                Not only would that leave you exposed, it could undermine the feeling of financial independence we all want in retirement

                Consider Fidelity’s own 2022 guidance that a retiring 65-year-old American couple can expect to spend $315,000 on medical and health expenses in retirement, a 5% jump over 2021

                What may be surprising, however, is that a popular recent answer to that retirement amount question — Fidelity Investments’ counsel to sock away 10 times your current annual income by age 67 — may be one of the most misleading pieces of advice on the retirement web

            <p>
                The states of Johor, Pahang and Sabah have been hit by flooding amid continuous heavy rain brought about by the northeast monsoon.  Nearly 14,000 people in the three states were in temporary flood relief centres, Bernama reported on Saturday morning, but that number fell significantly by evening.  “I don’t think a flood emergency should be declared because it only involves certain states and districts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The state disaster management committees have taken proactive measures together with the district disaster management committees,” said Ahmad Zahid, who is also the chairman of the Central Disaster Management Committee
            </p>

                “The aid provided has been given to all the heads of families and, at the same time, we have other matters that need to be carried out, including post-flood assistance,” he told a media conference after visiting a temporary relief centre in Mersing.  Ahmad Zahid, who is also the rural and regional development minister, added that the government will look into improving coordination among non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the relevant agencies involved in post-flood management
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked to comment on political developments a day after his party UMNO expelled former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin and suspended former defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein, Ahmad Zahid, who is party president, said he would only address flood-related questions.  “This is a press conference on flood matters only," he said, as quoted by the Star.  UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), Malaysia’s oldest political party, expelled Khairy and supreme council member Noh Omar on Friday for breaching party disciplinary rules during the country’s recent general election

                "That's my approach so I'm looking around, to research but I have an idea with which profiles we could strengthen the squad." United are the only English team left in four competitions and Ten Hag is keen to have a squad big enough to cope with the demands of a season that could stretch to more than 60 games

                Interest from West Ham in defender Harry Maguire has been rebuffed and Ten Hag has insisted the United captain remains an important player

                Former FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces fraud charges over the collapse of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, leaves on the day of a hearing at Manhattan federal court in New York City, US on Jan 3, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bankman-Fried, 30, has been free on a US$250 million bond since pleading not guilty to charges of fraud in the looting of billions of dollars from the now-bankrupt FTX
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prosecutors said their request was in response to Bankman-Fried's recent effort to contact a potential witness against him, the general counsel of an FTX affiliate, and was needed to prevent witness tampering and other obstruction of justice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They said a Signal ban isn't necessary because Bankman-Fried is not using the auto-delete feature, and the concern that he might is "unfounded"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyers also asked to remove a bail condition preventing Bankman-Fried from accessing FTX, Alameda or cryptocurrency assets, saying there was "no evidence" he was responsible for earlier alleged unauthorised transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an order on Saturday, Kaplan gave prosecutors until Monday to address Bankman-Fried's concerns

                Besides fiscal consolidation, Rafizi said, another challenge for the country is to broaden its revenue base

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 27 — The Malaysian chapter of a pro-caliphate group Hizbur Tahrir mounted its second demonstration outside the Embassy of the Netherlands here after Friday prayers this afternoon, protesting the desecration of a Quran by a Dutch political leader earlier this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some 80 members of the group, including children, had earlier held a peaceful protest outside the Swedish Embassy on Jalan Mayang Sari this morning, to condemn the burning of a Quran by Swedish-Danish politician Rasmus Paludan who leads a Danish party called Stram Kurs (which means Hard Line) outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed Oskam had “apologised” on behalf of the Netherlands government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But for us, the one who did it must apologise and the Netherlands government itself must apologise to all Muslims because the one who did it said his action was allowed by the government,” he told the demonstrators after meeting the Dutch representatives

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 27 — The Malaysian chapter of a pro-caliphate group Hizbur Tahrir mounted its second demonstration outside the Embassy of the Netherlands here after Friday prayers this afternoon, protesting the desecration of a Quran by a Dutch political leader earlier this week

            <p>
                Some 80 members of the group, including children, had earlier held a peaceful protest outside the Swedish Embassy on Jalan Mayang Sari this morning, to condemn the burning of a Quran by Swedish-Danish politician Rasmus Paludan who leads a Danish party called Stram Kurs (which means Hard Line) outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm last week

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But for us, the one who did it must apologise and the Netherlands government itself must apologise to all Muslims because the one who did it said his action was allowed by the government,” he told the demonstrators after meeting the Dutch representatives

            <p>

                This is after Nga revealed that his ministry would be meeting with contractors from Singapore’s HDB in order to learn about the island republic’s successful public housing programme.

                Puah, who is also Johor PKR vice-chairman, said there is no denying that Singapore’s Housing Development Board (HDB) is one of the most successful housing policies in the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that Singapore’s HDB units not only provide quality and affordable housing for its citizens, but its subsequent maintenance is also good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kedah Perikatan Nasional (PN) chief claimed that there is a hidden plan to revive the local government elections by emulating Singapore’s HDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dismissing the claims, Puah said Muhammad Sanusi may not realise that affordable housing is among one of the most pressing issues for young Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is after Nga revealed that his ministry would be meeting with contractors from Singapore’s HDB in order to learn about the island republic’s successful public housing programme.

                A draw with Volendam has seen Ajax extend their winless run in the Eredivisie to seven games, with their wait for a victory now costing Alfred Schreuder his job as Erik ten Hag's replacement Ajax have sacked Alfred Schreuder, who replaced Erik ten Hag as manager of the Dutch giants, after their winless run in the Eredivisie was extended to seven games

                The final straw for the Ajax board came on Thursday night when they saw Schreuder's men held to a draw by relegation threatened Volendam

            <p>
                Ajax even fell behind in that game, with the club deciding that Schreuder is not the man to turn their form around

                A draw with Volendam has seen Ajax extend their winless run in the Eredivisie to seven games, with their wait for a victory now costing Alfred Schreuder his job as Erik ten Hag's replacement Ajax have sacked Alfred Schreuder, who replaced Erik ten Hag as manager of the Dutch giants, after their winless run in the Eredivisie was extended to seven games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Schreuder only joined Ajax in the summer, coming in after Ten Hag left the Johan Cruyff Arena to take up his post at Manchester United

            <p>
                But the United boss has proved to be too tough an act to follow for Schreuder, who leaves with Ajax fifth in the table

            <p>
                The final straw for the Ajax board came on Thursday night when they saw Schreuder's men held to a draw by relegation threatened Volendam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ajax even fell behind in that game, with the club deciding that Schreuder is not the man to turn their form around

                On January 18, 2023, BMW of North America announced a safety recall for all 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP motorcycles due to the potential risk of a broken gearbox input shaft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This could, in turn, block the rear wheel, which could increase the risk of a crash.  According to BMW, approximately 18,489 motorcycles are involved in this recall, which represents 100 percent of the population
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BMW intensified its analysis of the issue, and eventually determined that if there is an abrupt difference between the engine speed and the rotational speed of the final drive component, the gearbox input shaft could become overloaded, and break as a result
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s why BMW decided to issue this recall.  Owners will be notified via postal mail that they should stop riding their affected bikes and contact their local authorized BMW dealer for recall service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BMW has also issued a Stop Sale notice to its dealers for all affected 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP bikes until recall service has been performed.  BMW North America notified its dealer network about this recall on January 18, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Owners may contact BMW customer service at 1-800-525-7417

                On January 18, 2023, BMW of North America announced a safety recall for all 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP motorcycles due to the potential risk of a broken gearbox input shaft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This could, in turn, block the rear wheel, which could increase the risk of a crash.  According to BMW, approximately 18,489 motorcycles are involved in this recall, which represents 100 percent of the population
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BMW intensified its analysis of the issue, and eventually determined that if there is an abrupt difference between the engine speed and the rotational speed of the final drive component, the gearbox input shaft could become overloaded, and break as a result
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s why BMW decided to issue this recall.  Owners will be notified via postal mail that they should stop riding their affected bikes and contact their local authorized BMW dealer for recall service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BMW has also issued a Stop Sale notice to its dealers for all affected 2019 through 2023 R 1250 GS, R 1250 GS Adventure, and R 1250 RTP bikes until recall service has been performed.  BMW North America notified its dealer network about this recall on January 18, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Owners may contact BMW customer service at 1-800-525-7417

                However, the virus is here to stay, say health experts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming of Universiti Malaya, a public health expert, said Malaysia has been one of the best countries in managing Covid-19 and has handled the pandemic well despite some initial hiccups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Public health expert Prof Dr Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia said the high number of deaths was unavoidable at one point as there was a severe health resource shortage and a lack of facilities, as well as proper isolation centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides Covid-19, Malaysia’s burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, hypertension and stroke are also high
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Universiti Malaya professor of epidemiology and public health Prof Dr Sanjay Rampal said while the Health Ministry responded well to the initial pandemic, future resilience would be highly dependent on investments in public health and healthcare systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Improving disaster resilience and strengthening public health and healthcare systems will be more cost-effective ways to prepare for future health threats,” he said

                However, the virus is here to stay, say health experts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming of Universiti Malaya, a public health expert, said Malaysia has been one of the best countries in managing Covid-19 and has handled the pandemic well despite some initial hiccups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Public health expert Prof Dr Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia said the high number of deaths was unavoidable at one point as there was a severe health resource shortage and a lack of facilities, as well as proper isolation centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides Covid-19, Malaysia’s burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, hypertension and stroke are also high
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Universiti Malaya professor of epidemiology and public health Prof Dr Sanjay Rampal said while the Health Ministry responded well to the initial pandemic, future resilience would be highly dependent on investments in public health and healthcare systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Improving disaster resilience and strengthening public health and healthcare systems will be more cost-effective ways to prepare for future health threats,” he said

                "Unfortunately, the results on the field have not been as we would have liked and as tough a decision as this was, the Board felt it necessary to give us the best possible chance of remaining a Championship club next season," Wigan chief executive Malachy Brannigan said in a club statement

                So all those payments take away from your retirement income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of December 2022, the average new car loan for a buyer with great credit was 8.6%, according to MyAutoloan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if you have bad credit, that average soars up to 22.16%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s about as much as the interest rate on a credit card
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If $400 goes into a car payment, and $300 to a credit card and more for student loans, suddenly you have far less cash on hand for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why not pay down your mortgage too? It’s not just the cheaper borrowing costs, although with the average national mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed rate at 6.15%, that is an advantage

                So all those payments take away from your retirement income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of December 2022, the average new car loan for a buyer with great credit was 8.6%, according to MyAutoloan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if you have bad credit, that average soars up to 22.16%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s about as much as the interest rate on a credit card
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If $400 goes into a car payment, and $300 to a credit card and more for student loans, suddenly you have far less cash on hand for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why not pay down your mortgage too? It’s not just the cheaper borrowing costs, although with the average national mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed rate at 6.15%, that is an advantage

                Julien Laurens warns Lyon's hot prospect Malo Gusto about making a big-money move to Chelsea

            <p>
                "I have the pleasure to explain that Malo Gusto, one of Lyon's big talents, will continue to play for Lyon until at least June 30 2023" Aulas said on social media
            </p>

                Gusto, 19, is out of contract with Lyon in June 2024

            <p>
                Aulas closing the door on a potential move could be seen as him trying to put pressure on Chelsea to increase their first offer and agree to let Gusto stay at Lyon on loan until the end of the season, which Chelsea have refused to agree to so far in the negotiations

                "I have the pleasure to explain that Malo Gusto, one of Lyon's big talents, will continue to play for Lyon until at least June 30 2023" Aulas said on social media

                Aulas closing the door on a potential move could be seen as him trying to put pressure on Chelsea to increase their first offer and agree to let Gusto stay at Lyon on loan until the end of the season, which Chelsea have refused to agree to so far in the negotiations

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The acquitted charge relates to an alleged incident of Tan hitting Lozares’ torso with a stick sometime in 2018 at the residence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court heard that Tan’s abuse of the victims began in September 2018, a month after both Lozares and Vegafria were employed by Tan’s husband Sim Guan Huat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her evidence, Lozares said that Tan was angry with her for putting on the socks wrongly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court heard that Lozares and Vegafria took turns to do this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tan will also have to compensate Lozares and Vegafria with S$2,500 and S$5,100 respectively, in line with what the prosecution sought

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2022 Umno General Assembly recently approved a motion for the president and deputy president posts to not be contested during the party election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Separately, Ahmad Zahid, who is also the deputy prime minister, said the government has not yet decided whether the Political Funding Bill will be tabled in the next Parliament session
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He, however, welcomed support from all political party leaders to be directly involved in drafting the bill

                MANCHESTER UNITED fans really were united after Wout Weghorst bagged his first goal for the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Netherlands international opened his account for the club in the first leg of United's Carabao Cup semi-final tie with Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst - who joined on loan at the Theatre of Dreams from Burnley to replace Cristiano Ronaldo - doubled United's lead with a perfectly-placed rebound before the stroke of half-time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And his finish - and how he's settled in at his new club better than new Al-Nassr star Ronaldo - quickly became the talk of the Old Trafford faithful

                MANCHESTER UNITED fans really were united after Wout Weghorst bagged his first goal for the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Netherlands international opened his account for the club in the first leg of United's Carabao Cup semi-final tie with Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weghorst - who joined on loan at the Theatre of Dreams from Burnley to replace Cristiano Ronaldo - doubled United's lead with a perfectly-placed rebound before the stroke of half-time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And his finish - and how he's settled in at his new club better than new Al-Nassr star Ronaldo - quickly became the talk of the Old Trafford faithful

                Elon Musk sees the toughest competition for Tesla in China, home of the company he expects “most likely to be second” in electric vehicles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China is Tesla Inc’s second-largest market — accounted for about two-thirds of all electric vehicles sales globally in 2022 — and the home of Tesla’s biggest plant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked about Tesla’s competition, Musk responded that he respected car companies in China, calling it the most competitive market in the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Musk did not identify any Chinese automakers by name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And so we guess, there is probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla.” Tesla recently promoted China chief Tom Zhu to run US factories and sales in North America and Europe, Reuters has reported

                Elon Musk sees the toughest competition for Tesla in China, home of the company he expects “most likely to be second” in electric vehicles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China is Tesla Inc’s second-largest market — accounted for about two-thirds of all electric vehicles sales globally in 2022 — and the home of Tesla’s biggest plant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked about Tesla’s competition, Musk responded that he respected car companies in China, calling it the most competitive market in the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Musk did not identify any Chinese automakers by name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And so we guess, there is probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla.” Tesla recently promoted China chief Tom Zhu to run US factories and sales in North America and Europe, Reuters has reported

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 26 — Despite its explanation, the Education Ministry continued to come under fire from some parents of the SMK Infant Jesus Convent in Johor over a workshop for students who will be sitting for their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a joint statement, eight members of the secondary school’s parent-teacher association (PTA) asserted that there were discrepancies between the ministry’s explanations and what they had been told by SMK Infant Jesus Convent’s principal Ande Noor Munawarah Bachok, news portal The Vibes reported today

            <p>
                Yesterday, Johor Education, Information and Communications Committee chairman Norlizah Noh said that the SPM workshop did not ignore or discriminate against the religion and ethnicity of students

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The issue stems from a post that went viral on Twitter alleging that discrimination had occurred in an SPM workshop organised by SMK Infant Jesus Convent that was held at Hotel Suasana in Johor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When disgruntled parents sought explanation on the school PIBG chatgroup, school Principal promptly shut down the convo,” the Twitter user claimed, referring to the school's PTA chatgroup.

                So with all of that in mind, football.london has decided to take a look at what the perfect ending to Arsenal's January window could look like should further additions be targeted in the coming days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to The Telegraph, Arsenal are actively showing interest in Caicedo as the club considers midfield options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An ideal alternative to Moises Caicedo would be Amadou Onana
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's believed Onana was on the Gunners' radar prior to his move to Merseyside, but again, he would not come cheaply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regardless of what happens in midfield, Arsenal beating the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Newcastle to land one of the hottest prospects in football would be an exciting piece of business in the remaining days of the window

                An Unofficial Liverpool FC Blog  Liverpool will face Brighton at the weekend in the FA Cup and once again, Moises Caicedo is linked with a move to Anfield

                News – Klopp has decided – Liverpool want signing of £52.6m playmaker to replace star According to AS, the 21-year-old central midfielder could end up leaving the Falmer Stadium outfit in the January transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AS claim Caicedo has recently changed his agent in order to push for a big money transfer in the current transfer window

            <p>
                Liverpool desperately need a young and quality player like the Ecuadorian to reinforce things in the center
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Have your say – Should Klopp push the owners to pay £65million for Moises Caicedo? My guess is that he is already pushing for FSG to commit funds for a midfielder which may or may not be Caicedo but unfortunately I’d also guess that he’ll run headlong into a Financial Brick Wall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FSG attended a meeting over the unrest at Boston Red Sox, has anything been heard from them with regard to Liverpool, the silence is deafening

                An Unofficial Liverpool FC Blog  Liverpool will face Brighton at the weekend in the FA Cup and once again, Moises Caicedo is linked with a move to Anfield

                News – Klopp has decided – Liverpool want signing of £52.6m playmaker to replace star According to AS, the 21-year-old central midfielder could end up leaving the Falmer Stadium outfit in the January transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AS claim Caicedo has recently changed his agent in order to push for a big money transfer in the current transfer window

            <p>
                Liverpool desperately need a young and quality player like the Ecuadorian to reinforce things in the center
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Have your say – Should Klopp push the owners to pay £65million for Moises Caicedo? My guess is that he is already pushing for FSG to commit funds for a midfielder which may or may not be Caicedo but unfortunately I’d also guess that he’ll run headlong into a Financial Brick Wall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FSG attended a meeting over the unrest at Boston Red Sox, has anything been heard from them with regard to Liverpool, the silence is deafening

                China is Tesla's second-largest market - accounting for about two-thirds of all electric vehicles sales globally in 2022 - and the home of Tesla's biggest plant

                Police officers aiding flood evacuees in Kota Marudu, Sabah on Jan 26, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of 12pm on Thursday (Jan 26), Malaysia’s National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) recorded 5,528 flood victims in Johor and 6,331 flood victims in Sabah.  This is an increase from the 3,937 flood victims in Johor recorded by the agency 24 hours prior.  Bernama reported that 55 relief centres have been opened in Johor as of 8am on Thursday to house the flood evacuees
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Segamat was the most affected district in Johor, followed by Kluang and Mersing, according to the state disaster management committee on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Sabah has seen more than 6,000 new flood evacuees in just a day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Bernama, 26 flood relief centres were opened as of 8am on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last month, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who is the Central Disaster Management Committee chairman, called for immediate long-term measures to resolve the country’s flood problem, including holistic flood mitigation projects.  Ahmad Zahid said that such flood management efforts, when completed, could ensure good long-term flood management until 2100

            <p>
                But let’s see."  Whilst Elneny is by no means a regular under Arteta, he has proven to be a decent backup option for Thomas Partey at the base of Arsenal's midfield over the past six to eight months

                One option, of course, is dipping into the transfer market before next Tuesday's deadline and Arteta himself has publicly stated that in an ideal world, he will be able to sign a midfielder

            <p>
                It means that Ten Hag will be determined to see a response from his side this evening, as they look to take a giant stride towards their first domestic cup final since reaching the FA Cup final in 2018

                The deal values Thrive at $5.3 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 2021, when it sold a stake to a unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to a spokeswoman for New York-based Thrive

                About Us Advertise   NEW YORK, Jan 25 ― A woman in New York state has filed a civil suit against Mike Tyson, accusing the former boxing champion of raping her in a limousine in the early 1990s, according to court filings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The woman, who asked the court to remain anonymous, filed her complaint in early January under a temporary New York state law allowing victims of sexual assault to seek civil damages regardless of the statute of limitations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tyson spent three years in jail beginning in 1992 after being found guilty of raping model Desiree Washington, who was 18 at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As a result of Tyson's rape, I suffered and continue to suffer from physical, psychological and emotional injury,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By late Tuesday, Tyson had not issued any public statement

                Stocks went on to surge as much as 52% after the July 2020 golden cross
            </p>

                The indicator can help alert traders to securities in the stock market that are solidifying their uptrend and are likely to experience a continuation with higher stock prices.  In December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average flashed the golden cross signal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The opposite signal to the golden cross is the "death cross," which is a sell signal that triggers when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He found that on average, stocks were higher three months after a golden cross 62% of the time, and higher six months after the golden cross 64% of the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average three-month return when stocks were higher after a golden cross was 7.33%, while the average return six months after the golden cross was 10.65%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stressing the importance that moving average crossover signals are not perfect, Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co., said of The Chart Report, "All big rallies start with a golden cross, but not all golden crosses lead to a big rally." The golden cross signal is one of many trading patterns that technical analysts employ to buy stocks. Meanwhile, the bearish death cross is in addition to many trading patterns that traders use to sell stocks.

                Liverpool may take advantage of the chance to sign Inter Milan defender Milan Skriniar on a free transfer

                Even a new year can't shake the bearishness from GMO's Jeremy Grantham, who said in a Tuesday letter that the stock market will drop another 20% this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Grantham said the ongoing deterioration of financial conditions will be capped off by a downturn in the housing market, representing the "final phase" of the stock market bubble that should help drive the S&P 500 to 3,200 by year-end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So you shouldn't be tempted to think its absolutely cannot happen," Grantham warned.  The key to whether or not Grantham's bleak scenario plays out this year hinges on investor confidence, which was on a slow yet steady decline throughout 2022 as every rally in stocks ended up being sold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The debt ceiling is another overhang for investors this year.  "Almost any pin can prick such supreme confidence and cause the first quick and severe decline," Grantham said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's because in 1929, 2000, and 2007, the largest part of the stock market decline occurred after the first rate cut from the Fed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Grantham does take comfort in the fact that corporate earnings estimates have yet to significantly decline despite all of the bearish possibilities.  "But still I'd prefer a lot more optimism, which a year ago was nearly universal," Grantham said.

                The findings from CIES Football Observatory's latest study isn't all that surprising, given how Chelsea and United have never been afraid to fork out big money to sign a player.  But the three other clubs that make up the top five may come as a shock to some

            <p>
                While Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain have also brought in several new players Finally, it's Wolves who take the fifth and final spot in the top five biggest spenders, having spent £179m (the same as Barcelona but £9m more if add-ons aren't included) on 11 players.   Premier League teams continue to dominant when it comes to spending in the market, with all but one English top-flight club featuring in the top 50

            <p>
                Leicester City are the only Premier League side that don't feature in the top 50
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Everton, meanwhile, have outspent Real Madrid by £2.6m but throwing money at the club's issues on and off the pitch has not solved their issues, with the club languishing in the relegation zone.  However, it is West Ham who take the final podium spot for biggest spenders this season Nottingham Forest are not far behind after spending £205m on 18 players Wolves have also not been afraid to shell out a hefty amount on players since last summer When it comes to a league's total spending as a whole, the Premier League is far above any other of the top five European divisions, having spent a combined £2.81billion on transfer fees (with add-ons included)

                The findings from CIES Football Observatory's latest study isn't all that surprising, given how Chelsea and United have never been afraid to fork out big money to sign a player.  But the three other clubs that make up the top five may come as a shock to some

            <p>
                While Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain have also brought in several new players Finally, it's Wolves who take the fifth and final spot in the top five biggest spenders, having spent £179m (the same as Barcelona but £9m more if add-ons aren't included) on 11 players.   Premier League teams continue to dominant when it comes to spending in the market, with all but one English top-flight club featuring in the top 50
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leicester City are the only Premier League side that don't feature in the top 50
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Everton, meanwhile, have outspent Real Madrid by £2.6m but throwing money at the club's issues on and off the pitch has not solved their issues, with the club languishing in the relegation zone.  However, it is West Ham who take the final podium spot for biggest spenders this season Nottingham Forest are not far behind after spending £205m on 18 players Wolves have also not been afraid to shell out a hefty amount on players since last summer When it comes to a league's total spending as a whole, the Premier League is far above any other of the top five European divisions, having spent a combined £2.81billion on transfer fees (with add-ons included)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LaLiga teams spent a total of £624m while Bundesliga teams spent £607m

                As Mohammed Salisu hacked clear, there were a queue of Newcastle players waiting but Joelinton seemed to control with his arm before his shot found the net and ref Stuart Attwell ruled it out.  Pope was soon forced into an improvised save from a fizzing, swerving low drive from Carlos Alcaraz.  And Pope, suddenly busy, had to dart out of his area to clear from Moussa Djenepro, thudding into the Saints winger as he did so but escaping punishment despite the howls of the home players and supporters

            <p>
                Almiron’s pace and trickery bewildered the Saints defence but after his low centre located Joelinton six yards out, the Brazilian somehow shot over despite attempting to side-foot, rather than blast it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alcaraz, who can definitely play a bit, released Che Adams but the sub almost had too much time to think and shot too close to Pope, who stuck out a foot to save.  This was more like it from Southampton and soon Adams forced a sprawling save from Pope.  But then Alexander Isak, just on for Callum Wilson, beat his man down the right and centred low for Joelinton to finally end his frustration from two yards as the Geordies cavorted behind him

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Almiron’s pace and trickery bewildered the Saints defence but after his low centre located Joelinton six yards out, the Brazilian somehow shot over despite attempting to side-foot, rather than blast it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alcaraz, who can definitely play a bit, released Che Adams but the sub almost had too much time to think and shot too close to Pope, who stuck out a foot to save.  This was more like it from Southampton and soon Adams forced a sprawling save from Pope.  But then Alexander Isak, just on for Callum Wilson, beat his man down the right and centred low for Joelinton to finally end his frustration from two yards as the Geordies cavorted behind him

                Whenever I’m in distress, His Majesty always shows concern,” he told the Malaysian media at the end of his two-day official visit to Brunei Wednesday (Jan 25)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said their strong bond was prominently visible during the visit

            <p>
                Earlier Wednesday, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah granted an audience to Anwar at Istana Nurul Iman here where they also had a four-eyed meeting

                The Prime Minister and the Sultan of Brunei also witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), between the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) and the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA)

                Almiron’s pace and trickery bewildered the Saints defence but after his low centre located Joelinton six yards out, the Brazilian somehow shot over despite attempting to side-foot, rather than blast it

                Alcaraz, who can definitely play a bit, released Che Adams but the sub almost had too much time to think and shot too close to Pope, who stuck out a foot to save.  This was more like it from Southampton and soon Adams forced a sprawling save from Pope.  But then Alexander Isak, just on for Callum Wilson, beat his man down the right and centred low for Joelinton to finally end his frustration from two yards as the Geordies cavorted behind him

                But after starting in Sunday’s narrow 3-2 defeat at Arsenal, McTominay could yet convince Ten Hag he still has a future at the club

                That’s as Erik ten Hag looks to raise transfer funds for a summer rebuild
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And his exit would open the door for Ten Hag to appoint a new skipper
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But after starting in Sunday’s narrow 3-2 defeat at Arsenal, McTominay could yet convince Ten Hag he still has a future at the club

                Stocks went on to surge as much as 52% after the July 2020 golden cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The indicator can help alert traders to securities in the stock market that are solidifying their uptrend and are likely to experience a continuation with higher stock prices.  In December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average flashed the golden cross signal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The opposite signal to the golden cross is the "death cross," which is a sell signal that triggers when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He found that on average, stocks were higher three months after a golden cross 62% of the time, and higher six months after the golden cross 64% of the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average three-month return when stocks were higher after a golden cross was 7.33%, while the average return six months after the golden cross was 10.65%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stressing the importance that moving average crossover signals are not perfect, Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co., said of The Chart Report, "All big rallies start with a golden cross, but not all golden crosses lead to a big rally." The golden cross signal is one of many trading patterns that technical analysts employ to buy stocks. Meanwhile, the bearish death cross is in addition to many trading patterns that traders use to sell stocks.

                (Bloomberg) -- China invoked the US’s brinkmanship over its own debt limit as it hit back at Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s criticism of Beijing’s handling of debt issues in developing countries

                Former state chairman Rosman Jonet said all eight divisions in Negri Sembilan had also been dissolved following a meeting of state leaders on Friday (Jan 20)
            </p>

            <p>
                Rosman claimed that Sng's decision to sack Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin and several others without discussing this first with the party's supreme council was tantamount to power abuse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It is an arrogant, uncivilised and irrational move which also goes to show that he has failed to manage the party well," he said, adding that Sng's regular use of social media to raise internal party issues had also affected the party's image
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosman claimed that Sng has also reneged on a promise to hand over the party presidency to Zuraida despite the matter being endorsed in the party's annual convention held on Oct 1, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Oct 28 last year, Sng announced the suspension of Zuraida and 12 supreme council members for allegedly undermining the interests of the party and its leadership

                Former state chairman Rosman Jonet said all eight divisions in Negri Sembilan had also been dissolved following a meeting of state leaders on Friday (Jan 20)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This also means that the youth and women's wings have also been disbanded," he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosman claimed that Sng's decision to sack Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin and several others without discussing this first with the party's supreme council was tantamount to power abuse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It is an arrogant, uncivilised and irrational move which also goes to show that he has failed to manage the party well," he said, adding that Sng's regular use of social media to raise internal party issues had also affected the party's image
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosman claimed that Sng has also reneged on a promise to hand over the party presidency to Zuraida despite the matter being endorsed in the party's annual convention held on Oct 1, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Oct 28 last year, Sng announced the suspension of Zuraida and 12 supreme council members for allegedly undermining the interests of the party and its leadership

                “Arsenal were interested earlier at Genk but he was too young and now he’s shown at Brighton he can be very decisive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has good feet, and he can play and link up so I think he can be a good player for Arsenal." Trossard was at Genk from 2012 through to 2019 and so spent six years at the Belgian side with Buffel who left in 2018 after nine years himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the teams are the same in the league, how they approach Arsenal compared to Brighton creates different tests but Buffel believes that Trossard will not have a problem with this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To make it at a club like Arsenal you have to take it week by week, game by game, with the best players and show that you can produce and be consistent

            <p>
                The dividend was declared in October and paid out on January 3 of this year

            </p>

                Every time the stock market rallied throughout the year, Wilson warned that it was nothing but a trap
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The S&P 500 has jumped more than 5% year-to-date amid fading inflation and recession fears, but Wilson believes corporate earnings are still set to take a hit, making the rise just another bear market rally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Suffice it to say, we're not biting on this recent rally because our work and process are so convincingly bearish on earnings.” Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimate for the S&P 500 in 2023 is $228 per share, but even without a recession, Morgan Stanley expects earnings per share of just $195 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because of this, he said he is even “increasingly eying” the “bear case” of $180 per in earnings for S&P 500 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                1 stock strategist honors in the latest Institutional Investor survey, isn’t alone in his fears that earnings could disappoint investors in the first half of the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wilson went on to say that he welcomed the recent surge in stocks, arguing that it is “a necessary condition” of the last gasps of the bear market

                The S&P 500 has jumped more than 5% year-to-date amid fading inflation and recession fears, but Wilson believes corporate earnings are still set to take a hit, making the rise just another bear market rally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Suffice it to say, we're not biting on this recent rally because our work and process are so convincingly bearish on earnings.” Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimate for the S&P 500 in 2023 is $228 per share, but even without a recession, Morgan Stanley expects earnings per share of just $195 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because of this, he said he is even “increasingly eying” the “bear case” of $180 per in earnings for S&P 500 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                1 stock strategist honors in the latest Institutional Investor survey, isn’t alone in his fears that earnings could disappoint investors in the first half of the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wilson went on to say that he welcomed the recent surge in stocks, arguing that it is “a necessary condition” of the last gasps of the bear market

                Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing said this was important to overcome the problem of long waiting times following the increasing number of tourists coming into Malaysia

                Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing said this was important to overcome the problem of long waiting times following the increasing number of tourists coming into Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The facial recognition system used by the Immigration Department should be extended to all international visitors and not limited to those holding long-term permits, to facilitate the clearance process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the statement, Tiong, on checking out the tourist arrival process at KLIA, found that tourists had to queue and were made to wait, some for almost two hours for the immigration check-in process

                The 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer, released during the World Economic Forum last week, showed that Malaysians polled felt their country is more divided than the two but also more optimistic that the division can be overcome

            <p>
                Malaysia's "polarisation score" was 55 — together with Indonesia, this was the lowest among the 28 countries studied

            <p>
                "Severely polarised" country has a score of 130 and above
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This comes as four in 10 Malaysian respondents said that the country is "more divided today than in the past"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Edelman, the online survey is conducted every year for the past 23 years

                The 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer, released during the World Economic Forum last week, showed that Malaysians polled felt their country is more divided than the two but also more optimistic that the division can be overcome
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia's "polarisation score" was 55 — together with Indonesia, this was the lowest among the 28 countries studied
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Severely polarised" country has a score of 130 and above
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This comes as four in 10 Malaysian respondents said that the country is "more divided today than in the past"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Edelman, the online survey is conducted every year for the past 23 years

            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It’s great that Jakub is joining us
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Jakub is a player who will give us strength and quality to our defensive unit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tomi has been playing left centre-back for the Japan national team, when you look at his games, he is great," the Spaniard said earlier in the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He can play as a left-back because you could not tell if he’s a right or left-footed player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s great that players are comfortable in more than one position." These comments and the fact Tomiyasu was told to warm up instead of Holding when Gabriel required treatment against Brentford back in September were, at the time, seen as the clearest 'confirmation' yet that the £18m signing from Bologna in the summer of 2021 was now the back-up left-sided centre-back option
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And now with the signing of Kiwior, it effectively confirms that Tomiyasu's role for the remainder of the season will be as a full-back, whether that's competing with Ben White on the right-hand side or Oleksandr Zinchenko and Kieran Tierney on the opposite flank

            <p>
                "Jakub is a player who will give us strength and quality to our defensive unit

            <p>
                Tomi has been playing left centre-back for the Japan national team, when you look at his games, he is great," the Spaniard said earlier in the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He can play as a left-back because you could not tell if he’s a right or left-footed player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s great that players are comfortable in more than one position." These comments and the fact Tomiyasu was told to warm up instead of Holding when Gabriel required treatment against Brentford back in September were, at the time, seen as the clearest 'confirmation' yet that the £18m signing from Bologna in the summer of 2021 was now the back-up left-sided centre-back option
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And now with the signing of Kiwior, it effectively confirms that Tomiyasu's role for the remainder of the season will be as a full-back, whether that's competing with Ben White on the right-hand side or Oleksandr Zinchenko and Kieran Tierney on the opposite flank

                Sweden and Finland applied last year to join NATO following Russia's invasion of Ukraine but all 30 member states must approve their bids

                Turkey had already summoned Sweden's ambassador and cancelled a planned visit by the Swedish defence minister to Ankara.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                "But Sweden will respect the agreement that exists between Sweden, Finland and Turkey regarding our NATO membership," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sweden and Finland applied last year to join NATO following Russia's invasion of Ukraine but all 30 member states must approve their bids
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Ultimately, this is a decision and consensus that Finland and Sweden are going to have to reach with Turkey," Price said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think in this case, what we've seen in the context of Sweden falls into that category," Price said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Turkey had already summoned Sweden's ambassador and cancelled a planned visit by the Swedish defence minister to Ankara.

                New Manchester United winger Antony has failed to impress during his time so far at the club Antony (L) scored on his Premier League debut during United's win over Arsenal in September Since then, the Brazilian has struggled to find form and was hooked off during Sunday's defeat Like with every newcomer to the English top-flight, there is a fair argument that the 22-year-old needs to be given reasonable time to adjust to the demands of playing in what many consider the toughest league in the world, but patience amongst United fans and former players is running out

                Scoring on his debut in United's 3-1 win over Arsenal near the start of the season, Antony went on to score in his next two league games, but since then highlights have been few and far between as the Brazilian struggled to build on bright moments

                Club legend Rio Ferdinand questioned Antony's quality following Sunday's defeat at Arsenal He needs to improve quickly with the impending return of Jadon Sancho bringing competition His trademark spin combined with blistering pace and an array of skills typical of Brazilian wingers means Antony has all the hallmarks to be a success in England's north-west.  But he needs to start demonstrating the qualities that first earned him a move to the club or else faces the exit door

            <p>
                The impending return of Sancho only heaps more pressure on Antony to start producing the goods for Man United with the club still realistically in the hunt for the Premier League title, but if improvement isn't seen soon then it would be no surprise to see Ten Hag drop the star and head back to the transfer market

            <p>
                But, being a member of an illegal organisation is an offence,” he told a press conference at the Terengganu police contingent headquarters today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was reported that several individuals, including policemen, were arrested for their alleged involvement in an illegal organisation around Dungun last Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The policemen were found to have been involved in the organisation since 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                United have been at their best this season when playing with speedsters in their front three
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Scott McTominay wasn't good or bad against Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet United can't win trophies with a player like the Scotland international and with Casemiro's suspension now over, he obviously has to come back in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When Casemiro is back on the field, however, United will be all the better for it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "They [Arsenal] are very good on the ball but we are a good defending team

            <p>
                Fancied India, led by defender Harmanpreet Singh, needed a win to make the quarter-finals of field hockey's biggest tournament and had the home fans on edge after the match ended 3-3 in Bhubaneswar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                New Zealand came back from 3-1 down to level the contest and then held their nerve as the penalty shootout went to sudden death
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sixth-ranked India once dominated men's field hockey, winning eight Olympic gold medals between 1928 and 1980
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former national game of the cricket-mad nation witnessed a revival after India won bronze at the Tokyo Olympics and followed it up with a Commonwealth Games silver in Birmingham last year

                (Bloomberg) -- Ken Griffin’s Citadel churned out a record $16 billion in profit for clients last year, outperforming the rest of the industry and one of history’s most successful financial plays
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citadel’s gain was the largest annual return for a hedge fund manager, surpassing the $15 billion that John Paulson generated in 2007 on his bet against subprime mortgages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it’s a different story outside the industry giants, with hedge funds overall losing $208 billion last year as many managers found themselves on the wrong side of global market turmoil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The findings also reflect the growing clout of multistrategy hedge fund firms, which are on the cusp of taking over equity-focused funds to become the dominant strategy in the industry
            </p>

            <p>
                The top 20 managers, which oversaw almost 19% of the industry assets, produced $692 billion of that profit, or 49% of the total

                Rio Ferdinand slammed Manchester United winger Antony for his performance versus Arsenal  Ferdinand was speaking on his show FIVE - after his old side fell to a 3-2 defeat at the Emirates ‘He just doesn’t beat anyone and I’m sitting there thinking, “Was that always the way?”' Ferdinand said

                ‘I saw Thomas Partey, who I wouldn’t put down as a sprinter, absolutely burst past him, and I’m thinking, “Woah, he (Antony) hasn’t got much power in them legs!” ‘He’s a tricky winger, but with tricky wingers you want them to still be able to beat the defender.' Ferdinand also suggested Luke Shaw (left) was 'scared' of Bukayo Sake (right) during the game Saka scored Arsenal's second goal and was in fine form for Arsenal against the Red Devils Ferdinand then went on to suggest United defender Luke Shaw was 'scared' of Bukayo Saka at the Emirates.  Saka scored Arsenal's second to put his side ahead at the Emirates, and gave his England colleague a tough time on the day with his impressive dribbling and direct running

            <p>
                But Shaw’s been magnificent for United up to this point.’  Though they netted twice in the game, United manager Erik ten Hag berated his side's defending, claiming they have to 'change their mentality' if they want to win trophies

                But despite a five-point lead at the top, and with second-place City having played an extra game, Arsenal have only reached the halfway point of the season

                The Bukit Aman Traffic Investigation and Enforcement Department released an infographic on Monday (Jan 23) showing that 1,724 vehicles were involved in 1,445 accidents on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a related matter, the department has gone to the ground to advocate road safety during the festive season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said the initiative was a step towards reducing road accidents, emphasising road safety and educating road users to obey traffic laws while practising good driving habits

                In the first quarter, Spain had two penalty corners, one in the first minute and the second in the 12th minute
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                In the second quarter, Malaysia looked better in terms of movement and circle penetration, but Spain had the best chance in the 20th minute when Joaquin Menini unleashed a reverse stick shot, which Hafizuddin saved beautifully

                Spain's resurgence was rewarded when they got a penalty stroke in the 40th minute, and Marc Miralles buried it from the spot
