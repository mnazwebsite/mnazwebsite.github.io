                Families of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously nine years ago, called on the government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane

            <p>
                The firm's search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, US$135.36 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful

                Families of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously nine years ago, called on the government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane

            <p>
                In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to US$70 million if it found the plane

            <p>
                The firm's search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year, US$135.36 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane

            <p>
                On Sunday, Voice370 - a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane - said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful

                Fred is enjoying his best season at Manchester United despite a reduction in his minutes Erik ten Hag has shown how to get the best out of Fred and get the most out of his strengths The signing of Casemiro has been particularly influential in helping Fred improve this season Ten Hag's arrival at the club raised the question of whether Fred had a future at the club - talk which heightened after United lost their first two matches of the season  with a 2-1 loss to Brighton and a 4-0 thumping by Brentford - both of which the Brazilian started and struggled.  Following the loss to Brentford, Fred started just two league games before January's 2-1 victory over rivals Man City.   But that doesn't tell the full story as Fred has often been Ten Hag's go-to player off the bench, improving after being given reduced on-field responsibilities and a clearer role.   He has played a bigger part since the World Cup, registering five goals - including a vital finish in their Europa League victory over Barcelona - and three assists in that time.  In the 20 matches he's played since the return of domestic football, he's started ten games

                Though it should be noted that Christian Eriksen's injury has opened the door for Fred to reclaim a place in the starting XI.  But now as a starter, Fred looks more comfortable now that he has that defensive rock alongside him in Casemiro

            <p>
                Casemiro's presence has minimised the amount of work Fred needs to do defensively in games, which has allowed Ten Hag to tactically move the latter further up the pitch

            <p>
                United were heavily interested in signing the Dutchman from Barcelona last summer, after impressing Ten Hag during their time together at Ajax

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 5 — Malaysia would carefully evaluate new search operations for Flight MH370 were new and credible information to emerge about its location, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a message ahead of the ninth anniversary of the plane’s disappearance in 2014, Loke also expressed his sympathies to the families of those on board the Malaysia Airlines flight that vanished without a trace
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As transport minister, I will not summarily close the book on this tragedy,” Loke said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To date, the plane as well as the 239 (227 passengers 12 crew) passengers have not been found despite a multinational search effort that lasted years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It has been recorded as the most expensive search effort in aviation history

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 5 — Malaysia would carefully evaluate new search operations for Flight MH370 were new and credible information to emerge about its location, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a message ahead of the ninth anniversary of the plane’s disappearance in 2014, Loke also expressed his sympathies to the families of those on board the Malaysia Airlines flight that vanished without a trace
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As transport minister, I will not summarily close the book on this tragedy,” Loke said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To date, the plane as well as the 239 (227 passengers 12 crew) passengers have not been found despite a multinational search effort that lasted years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It has been recorded as the most expensive search effort in aviation history

                Brandt has long been linked with a move to the Premier League leaders over the past few years, but he has remained loyal to Dortmund since joining from Bayer Leverkusen in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dortmund could therefore come under pressure to sell Brandt this summer before he walks away for nothing in 2024, and he would seemingly not be short of suitors amid an eye-catching season for Edin Terzic's side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to German outlet Bild, Arsenal remain attentive to Brandt's situation and could make a move for the German this summer if he opts not to renew his Dortmund contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report states that Brandt would welcome a change of scenery at this stage of his career, and he has informed his entourage that he would be interested in a move to the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since joining for a €25m (£22.1m) fee from Leverkusen in the summer of 2019, Brandt has made 158 appearances for Dortmund in all tournaments, scoring 29 goals and setting up 30 more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While adept in the number 10 role, Brandt has recently been deployed as a winger - an area where Arsenal may be looking for additional cover in the summer transfer window

                “As such, we decided that expensive flood mitigation projects worth RM600 million (US$134 million) and more will be expedited.” Mr Anwar said the postponement of six flood mitigation projects before this was to avoid leakages in allocations to assist the people

                “Although there are also some places where the floodwaters remain stagnant, there is no need for a (disaster) emergency (to be declared) for now,” he told reporters after visiting a relief centre at Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (Cina) Kampung Tengah

                People wade through a flooded residential area at Yong Peng, Johor, Malaysia on Mar 4, 2023

                “As such, we decided that expensive flood mitigation projects worth RM600 million (US$134 million) and more will be expedited.” Mr Anwar said the postponement of six flood mitigation projects before this was to avoid leakages in allocations to assist the people

            <p>
                “The government’s decision to not declare a state of emergency is because rain has started to taper off and floodwaters have begun to recede in several places," he said

            <p>
                “Although there are also some places where the floodwaters remain stagnant, there is no need for a (disaster) emergency (to be declared) for now,” he told reporters after visiting a relief centre at Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (Cina) Kampung Tengah

                A Cabinet meeting on Friday had decided that there was no need for a flood emergency to be declared in Johor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The number of flood victims in relief centres in Johor, Pahang and Melaka continued to rise, while two other states showed a drop as of 2pm on Sunday

                Kia is about to release a new fully-electric SUV that’s called the EV9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similar to its current EV6, the Kia EV9 is based on the Hyundai-Kia group’s E-GMP platform which uses an 800V electrical architecture
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The full design of the Kia EV6 will be unveiled on 15th March 2023 and the Korean carmaker has dropped a couple of video teasers of its design and lighting effects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In terms of size, you can expect it to be as large as the Kia Telluride, a model that’s a class above the current Kia Sorento
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since Hyundai and Kia are from the same group, the EV9’s closest cousin will be the upcoming Ioniq 7 which was showcased as the Concept “Seven”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since Hyundai has recently launched the Ioniq 6 4-door coupe EV, we reckon that the Kia EV9 will be released earlier than the Ioniq 7

                The communications and digital minister noted there are many people who are using Mentega Terbang to stir racial sentiments, claiming there are elements in the local film that are insensitive of Islam, the religion of the majority in Malaysia

                Who was governing then? Why no action at the time? Where were these people who are raising this issue now back then? “We can’t be hypocrites, it’s not a new film

                He explained that the rice he was having in the video was dry, which was why he jokingly poured orange juice on it

            <p>
                They want to add gravy but why add now and not when you were in charge? “So since we are in charge now, we will definitely take action and investigate the matter to ensure everything complies with the law,” he said

                The communications and digital minister noted there are many people who are using Mentega Terbang to stir racial sentiments, claiming there are elements in the local film that are insensitive of Islam, the religion of the majority in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Who was governing then? Why no action at the time? Where were these people who are raising this issue now back then? “We can’t be hypocrites, it’s not a new film
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that the rice he was having in the video was dry, which was why he jokingly poured orange juice on it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It’s the intentions of those who lack gravy in their rice, who have ulterior motives, who want to pour orange juice on their plate due to lack of gravy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They want to add gravy but why add now and not when you were in charge? “So since we are in charge now, we will definitely take action and investigate the matter to ensure everything complies with the law,” he said

                Mentega Terbang the film takes a look at the similarities and expressions of the major religions in Malaysia

                According to these reports, the Proton X90 will be a mild hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MHEV hybrid system is expected to be a 1.5 litre three-cylinder 48V engine+motor combo producing 190 PS at 5,500 rpm and 300 Nm of torque from 1,500-4,000 rpm, which is higher than the 177 PS, 255 Nm non-hybrid version of the engine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Firstly, Proton has already exhibited this engine at Proton’s Centre of Excellence showroom in Shah Alam back in November 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How does the Proton X90’s 48V hybrid system work?  The system takes the regular 3-cylinder 1.5 litre turbocharged engine and adds a number of components to it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hybrid system can provide 13 horsepower and 45 Nm of assist, which is what brings the 177 PS, 255 Nm numbers of the non-hybrid up to 190 PS and 300 Nm in the hybrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since it’s called a ‘mild’ hybrid system, the capabilities are also modest

            <p>
                The MHEV hybrid system is expected to be a 1.5 litre three-cylinder 48V engine+motor combo producing 190 PS at 5,500 rpm and 300 Nm of torque from 1,500-4,000 rpm, which is higher than the 177 PS, 255 Nm non-hybrid version of the engine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Firstly, Proton has already exhibited this engine at Proton’s Centre of Excellence showroom in Shah Alam back in November 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How does the Proton X90’s 48V hybrid system work?  The system takes the regular 3-cylinder 1.5 litre turbocharged engine and adds a number of components to it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hybrid system can provide 13 horsepower and 45 Nm of assist, which is what brings the 177 PS, 255 Nm numbers of the non-hybrid up to 190 PS and 300 Nm in the hybrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since it’s called a ‘mild’ hybrid system, the capabilities are also modest
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 5 — Nooryana Najwa Najib has a reminder for sceptics who question the acquittal of her father and former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak of the 1MDB audit tampering charge last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means Najib, who was also the former finance minister, no longer has to face the charge under Section 23(1) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In order to prove a prima facie case for Najib to defend himself, the prosecution would have to prove all elements of the Section 23(1) charge against him, namely that Najib was an officer of a public body and that he used his office for “gratification”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court noted that there was no dispute with the first element as Najib was an officer of a public body as the prime minister and finance minister then, but concluded that the prosecution failed to prove the second element involving gratification

                "Let's strengthen synergy amongst stakeholders to control inflation." The Consumer Price Index in Southeast Asia's largest economy rose 5.47 per cent in February from a year earlier, largely due to higher prices for fuel, rice, cigarettes and air travel, though core inflation unexpectedly slowed to 3.09 per cent

            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The government and central bank will continue our synergy" to achieve the government's target of 3.6 per cent for the full year, "and this will become a strong foundation to face uncertainty in 2023 and 2024," Airlangga said

                Sign up to receive the best LFC opinion direct to your inbox We have more newsletters With Liverpool looking to strengthen in midfield areas this summer, one experienced Serie A star may provide a cut-price solution for Jürgen Klopp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, it would not be surprising if the Reds attempt to grab a bargain during the next transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the form of Fabinho having been below what one has come to expect of the Brazilian so far this term, and with Jordan Henderson turning 33 before the start of next season, it would seem logical that Liverpool would look to strengthen in the number six' position
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps, in Locatelli, Klopp may find himself a bargain who can add experience, while also having his best years ahead of him.

                Liverpool is expected to be in the market for midfielders this summer as several established names look set to depart Anfield

                Jürgen Klopp may spot a bargain

            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, it would not be surprising if the Reds attempt to grab a bargain during the next transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the form of Fabinho having been below what one has come to expect of the Brazilian so far this term, and with Jordan Henderson turning 33 before the start of next season, it would seem logical that Liverpool would look to strengthen in the number six' position
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps, in Locatelli, Klopp may find himself a bargain who can add experience, while also having his best years ahead of him.

                Graham Potter speaks after Chelsea's 1-0 win over Leeds in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, even if Saturday's win was less than spectacular, it transformed Potter's post-match demeanour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It's a big win," a beaming Potter told reporters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It's really good for the players to win and to keep a clean sheet," Potter said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                as we prepare for a massive game on Tuesday." Chelsea face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League round of 16 on Tuesday, needing to claw back a 1-0 deficit from the first leg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will need to step up a gear to do that but Potter believes Saturday's goal can be the start of many

                After finishing second behind Manchester City last season, Liverpool sit outside the Premier League's top four ahead of their Premier League clash with Manchester United  Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has blamed a lack of consistency for his team's struggles to replicate last season's quadruple push
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp's Reds won both domestic cups last term, as well as reaching the Champions League final and finishing second in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool sit sixth in the table ahead of Sunday's game at home to Manchester United, with a 21-point gap to league-leaders Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We've got four good results in the league on the bounce now, and it's something that we want to build on and push towards the end of the season for."   Will Liverpool claw their way back into the top four? Have your say in the comments section
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Red Devils also beat Liverpool when the teams last met, back in August, to deliver Ten Hag his first Premier League win
            </p>

                15726  A court ruling has sided with former SM executive producer Lee Soo Man in the provisional injunction against SM Entertainment issuing new shares and convertible bonds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plan for Kakao Entertainment to become the second largest shareholder through the allocation of new shares and CBs has been put to a sudden halt with the latest court decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court explained, "It is difficult to conclude that the company needed to allocate and issue new shares and convertible bonds to Kakao in order to achieve management objectives such as urgent financing, business expansion, and strategic alliance in this case without the existing shareholders' warrants for new shares."  On the same day, HYBE made an official statement stating, "As the largest shareholder of SM, we respect the court's decision to quote the provisional injunction, and we thank the Seoul Eastern District Court for making the right decision."  HYBE continued, "Through this decision, illegal attempts by SM's current management to influence the company's governance will be clearly stopped, and everything will now fall back into place

                Their plan was not well thought out (and actually illegal) and to their dismay, LSM was able to almost immediately derail it by selling his shares to HYBE

                No matter what, for better or worse, SME is entering a new "season" with a new cast of players

                About Us Advertise NEW YORK, March 4 — US prosecutors yesterday urged a judge to sentence former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng to 15 years in prison after he was convicted of helping loot billions of dollars from Malaysia’s 1MDB sovereign wealth fund

                A jury in Brooklyn federal court had last April found Ng, Goldman’s former head of investment banking in Malaysia, guilty of helping his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from the fund, launder the proceeds and bribe government officials to win business

            <p>
                US District Judge Margo Brodie is expected to sentence Ng on March 9

            <p>
                In October 2020, Goldman agreed to pay US$2.9 billion and its Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge
            </p>

                Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case for Najib to answer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When met after the High Court’s decision, deputy public prosecutor Kamal Baharin Omar confirmed to reporters that the prosecution would study the grounds of judgment and would refer the matter to the attorney general to decide on whether an appeal would be filed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) almost always notify the court that they would appeal after losing a criminal trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The filing of a notice for appeal would be done even before the grounds of judgement had been given, added Apandi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the filing of the notice of appeal, the court would have to make a signed copy of the grounds of decision in the case and cause it to be served upon the AGC if the public prosecutor is the appellant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only then would the AGC be in possession of the full grounds of decision for it to study the grounds given by the trial judge, and then decide whether to proceed or not with the appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The public therefore can expect the AGC to appeal because it is “almost automatic”, more so when the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case at the end of its own case

                Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case for Najib to answer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When met after the High Court’s decision, deputy public prosecutor Kamal Baharin Omar confirmed to reporters that the prosecution would study the grounds of judgment and would refer the matter to the attorney general to decide on whether an appeal would be filed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) almost always notify the court that they would appeal after losing a criminal trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The filing of a notice for appeal would be done even before the grounds of judgement had been given, added Apandi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the filing of the notice of appeal, the court would have to make a signed copy of the grounds of decision in the case and cause it to be served upon the AGC if the public prosecutor is the appellant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only then would the AGC be in possession of the full grounds of decision for it to study the grounds given by the trial judge, and then decide whether to proceed or not with the appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The public therefore can expect the AGC to appeal because it is “almost automatic”, more so when the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case at the end of its own case

                Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case for Najib to answer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When met after the High Court’s decision, deputy public prosecutor Kamal Baharin Omar confirmed to reporters that the prosecution would study the grounds of judgment and would refer the matter to the attorney general to decide on whether an appeal would be filed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) almost always notify the court that they would appeal after losing a criminal trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The filing of a notice for appeal would be done even before the grounds of judgement had been given, added Apandi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the filing of the notice of appeal, the court would have to make a signed copy of the grounds of decision in the case and cause it to be served upon the AGC if the public prosecutor is the appellant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only then would the AGC be in possession of the full grounds of decision for it to study the grounds given by the trial judge, and then decide whether to proceed or not with the appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The public therefore can expect the AGC to appeal because it is “almost automatic”, more so when the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case at the end of its own case

                Bajcetic had just scored his first Premier League goal in a 3-1 win, leaving Jurgen Klopp ecstatic; when he returned to the dressing room, the rest of Liverpool's squad were waiting to give him a standing ovation

                Jurgen Klopp (right) is a huge fan of the 18-year-old and has instilled his trust in him 'When I lose the ball, I try to win it back as fast as I can,' says Bajcetic
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 — Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Tim Leissner was ordered to forfeit US$43.7 million in cash and US$3.3 million worth of shares in fitness drink company Celsius Holdings Inc

                Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino will depart the Reds at the end of the season at the end of his contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But where will he end up? There will be plenty of options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, on a free transfer, he could be an astute purchase for the right team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Gazzetta also reports that Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid are interested in Firmino, and journalist Jorge Nicola claimed on YouTube (in December, via Sport Witness) that Brazilian club Corinthians could even be an option
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Atlético Madrid could be a viable option as well, with Firmino still having time left in his career to make an impact at a high level, even if Liverpool is right to let him leave
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Serie A could be a slightly less intense league which could help Firmino extend his career at the top level, while a move back to South America could potentially be appealing, but perhaps not quite yet

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 — Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Tim Leissner was ordered to forfeit US$43.7 million in cash and US$3.3 million worth of shares in fitness drink company Celsius Holdings Inc
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leissner has been free on a US$20 million bail since his arrest in June 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng alleged that Leissner took his original US$1.25 million investment in Celsius and claims it has since grown in value enormously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US said evidence showed Ng collected US$35.1 million in the fraud while Leissner received US$73.4 million

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leissner testified at the trial that, as part of his guilty plea, he had agreed to surrender a stake in Celsius he estimated was now worth about US$200 million and had previously posted US$3.25 million shares in Celsius as collateral to secure his bond

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 — Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Tim Leissner was ordered to forfeit US$43.7 million in cash and US$3.3 million worth of shares in fitness drink company Celsius Holdings Inc
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leissner has been free on a US$20 million bail since his arrest in June 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng alleged that Leissner took his original US$1.25 million investment in Celsius and claims it has since grown in value enormously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US said evidence showed Ng collected US$35.1 million in the fraud while Leissner received US$73.4 million
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leissner testified at the trial that, as part of his guilty plea, he had agreed to surrender a stake in Celsius he estimated was now worth about US$200 million and had previously posted US$3.25 million shares in Celsius as collateral to secure his bond

                In a Facebook post on Friday (March 3) evening, MRT Corp said commuters can travel all the way from Kwasa Damansara to Putrajaya Sentral (and vice versa) beginning at 3pm on March 16

            <p>
                The Putrajaya Line, formerly known as the Sungai Buloh-Serdang-Putrajaya (SSP) line, runs through 36 stations to complete what is known as Klang Valley's second MRT line

                With its full opening, it will be possible to get to KLIA and KLIA2 from downtown Kuala Lumpur for less than RM15

            <p>
                This can be done by taking the MRT to Putrajaya Sentral, with the fare expected to cost only a few ringgit

            <p>
                From Putrajaya Sentral, one can transfer over to the KLIA Transit, a service that is part of the Express Rail Line (ERL), with a one-way fare to either KLIA or KLIA2 costing only RM9.40

                He said the policies would take into account the economic slowdown in 2023, citing a predicted smaller growth of the global economy at 2.9 per cent compared to 3.4 per cent last year

                Visiting the Huawei booth #MWC2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They have a dozen or so boards on display and the package of every single chip on every single board is obscured
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Back in 2019, the then-Trump administration signed in an executive order that very squarely trained its sights on Huawei and its telecommunications business at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only did this ban prevent US companies from using equipment from the Chinese brand, it also prohibit the company from using US technologies – Google’s GMS was one such service that was forcibly removed from Huawei’s smartphones but not the use of Android OS, which in turn forced the brand to switch to its own self-named HMS APK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When the Biden administration came into power, Huawei hoped that it would do away with the executive order but sadly, it chose to expand on the blacklist of Chinese firms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That isn’t to say that firms like Huawei are completely cut off from US-made chips entirely, at least on an official level

                Visiting the Huawei booth #MWC2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They have a dozen or so boards on display and the package of every single chip on every single board is obscured
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Back in 2019, the then-Trump administration signed in an executive order that very squarely trained its sights on Huawei and its telecommunications business at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only did this ban prevent US companies from using equipment from the Chinese brand, it also prohibit the company from using US technologies – Google’s GMS was one such service that was forcibly removed from Huawei’s smartphones but not the use of Android OS, which in turn forced the brand to switch to its own self-named HMS APK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When the Biden administration came into power, Huawei hoped that it would do away with the executive order but sadly, it chose to expand on the blacklist of Chinese firms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That isn’t to say that firms like Huawei are completely cut off from US-made chips entirely, at least on an official level
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 — Former MCA president Tan Sri Lee San Choon has passed away at the age of 87
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former fourth president of MCA was hailed as a legendary politician for leading his party through three general elections, with the most successful being the 1982 general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to the 1982 general election, he accepted former DAP’s secretary-general Lim Kit Siang's challenge to contest in a Chinese-majority constituency and won against the former DAP’s chairman Chen Man Hin in his Seremban stronghold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He started off his political career by joining MCA in 1957 and went on to win the Klang Utara parliamentary seat in the 1959 general election and became the youngest MP in the country at the age of 24
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lee dramatically retired from politics at the height of his political career by resigning from the Cabinet on March 24, 1983 and relinquishing his position as the president of MCA the next day for unspecified reasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former statesman however explained in 2000 to Asiaweek that he was "stabbed in the back” by Umno leaders in the 1982 election.

                Lee Suet Fern acted with complete disregard for Lee Kuan Yew’s interests While Thomas claims in the e-book that Suet Fern made an “innocent mistake” in sending Lee Kuan Yew a different version of the will, the tribunal and the court found that she had acted with complete disregard for his interests

            <p>
                Lee Hsien Yang’s act of cutting out Kwa Kim Li from communications with Lee Kuan Yew on the last will was disturbing and troubling Thomas suggests in the e-book that there was no “shady behaviour” when Lee Hsien Yang excluded Kwa in communications with his father

            <p>
                Paragraph 607 of the tribunal’s report also said Suet Fern “misled Lee (Kuan Yew) on the terms of the last will that he was going to sign” and “Lee was persuaded into signing the last will within 16 hours”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lee Kuan Yew did not have discussions with Kwa Kim Li about reinserting a demolition clause into the last will, and was not advised by Lee Suet Fern on the reinsertion Thomas said in the e-book that the last will was based on the late Lee’s orders and suggested that he had made a conscious decision to include the demolition clause
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Paragraphs 537 and 538 of the tribunal’s report noted that Suet Fern “did not tell Lee (Kuan Yew) that the demolition clause (which had been removed in the penultimate will) had been reinserted in the draft last will that she sent to Lee (Kuan Yew)”.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lee Hsien Yang’s act of cutting out Kwa Kim Li from communications with Lee Kuan Yew on the last will was disturbing and troubling Thomas suggests in the e-book that there was no “shady behaviour” when Lee Hsien Yang excluded Kwa in communications with his father
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Paragraph 607 of the tribunal’s report also said Suet Fern “misled Lee (Kuan Yew) on the terms of the last will that he was going to sign” and “Lee was persuaded into signing the last will within 16 hours”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lee Kuan Yew did not have discussions with Kwa Kim Li about reinserting a demolition clause into the last will, and was not advised by Lee Suet Fern on the reinsertion Thomas said in the e-book that the last will was based on the late Lee’s orders and suggested that he had made a conscious decision to include the demolition clause
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Paragraphs 537 and 538 of the tribunal’s report noted that Suet Fern “did not tell Lee (Kuan Yew) that the demolition clause (which had been removed in the penultimate will) had been reinserted in the draft last will that she sent to Lee (Kuan Yew)”.

                Authorities rescuing flood victims in Segamat, Johor on Mar 1, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA), 209 flood relief centres have been opened in Johor.  Segamat remains the worst affected district in the state, with 11,941 people evacuated to 76 flood relief centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the district of Johor Bahru, 1,216 victims from 356 families were evacuated to six flood relief centres.  Aside from Johor, the states of Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka in Peninsular Malaysia are also affected by the floods
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Across the three states, 44 flood relief centres were open as of Friday morning, accommodating some 3,000 victims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Separately, in the East Malaysian state of Sarawak, 43 people have been evacuated to two flood relief centres.  The death toll due to the flood in the country has risen to three victims, with the latest being two senior citizens believed to have been trapped in their homes in Segamat, Johor.  Segamat district police chief Superintendant Ahmad Zamry Marinsah said that the bodies of a man and a woman in their 70s were found at about 11am on Thursday by officers who were monitoring the area after the flood had receded

                Hong Kong singer Aaron Kwok has, for the first time, publicly opened up about the grisly murder of socialite Abby Choi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My wife and I were friends of the other party
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Six arrests have been made in connection with the late socialite's murder as of Thursday (March 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fifth suspect, believed to be the mistress of Kwong's father, was arrested on Feb 26 for allegedly renting out the unit where Choi's body parts were found

                Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said during a visit to the Philippines that Asean must prove it is "relevant" in helping to resolve the crisis in Myanmar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a pre-recorded interview with Philippine news channel ANC aired on Friday, Anwar said that Asean, which is leading diplomatic efforts to bring peace, needed to be more assertive and noted that his country was shouldering 200,000 displaced people from Myanmar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We can't see this as a purely internal issue, so I have appealed to friends in Asean to say, look we have to be tougher," Anwar said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If necessary engage with the armed forces of this country because sometimes the military junta does not understand the civilian narrative." Myanmar has been beset by social, political and economic chaos since its military overthrew an elected government in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the 10-member bloc has barred Myanmar's generals from attending its high-level meetings, Malaysia, a vocal critic of the junta, has called for tougher action
            </p>

                Myanmar's military rulers have reacted angrily to what they call interference by Asean members

                Manchester United have won the Carabao Cup and they are still in contention to add the FA Cup, Europa League and Premier League to their trophy cabinet this season Manchester United are on a roll under Erik ten Hag – and their success could see them rake in huge amounts through generous bonuses in the coming months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag’s side are third in the Premier League and remain in both the Europa League and FA Cup

                United probably don’t need any more motivation to add to their trophy haul, but the Daily Mail reports that the players could take home £485,000 each in bonuses if they add the Premier League, Europa League and FA Cup to the Carabao Cup by the end of the season

                Victory in the FA Cup and Europa League is reportedly worth £85,000 each to the players, while the Premier League would net them a staggering £250,000

                Manchester United have won the Carabao Cup and they are still in contention to add the FA Cup, Europa League and Premier League to their trophy cabinet this season Manchester United are on a roll under Erik ten Hag – and their success could see them rake in huge amounts through generous bonuses in the coming months

                Liverpool could be accused of not having enough street-smarts at times this season, but Jürgen Klopp may have just seen a transfer solution bred in futsal

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite a recent resurgence in the Premier League, it is expected that Liverpool will enter the transfer market in the summer for some reinforcements at center-back, with Joe Gomez and Joël Matip having been inconsistent this season, and with the latter having entered the final 18 months of his current deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Kilman has supposedly emerged as the potential bargain transfer solution for Liverpool, with Tottenham also said to be interested in the 25-year-old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only does the Wolves defender boast extensive Premier League experience, with 77 top-flight appearances to his name, but he is also a senior home-grown player, which is something that may prove attractive depending on Liverpool's outgoings this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When one looks closer at Kilman's numbers, it is clear why both Liverpool and Spurs are rumored to have designs on signing the 6"4 defender who has been an ever-present for Wolves this season, and who played 31 times in the league last year

                The new visa system put in place after Brexit is a contributory factor to Premier League clubs spending record sums on transfer fees as they find it more difficult to sign players at a younger age, the league's chief executive Richard Masters said on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A UEFA report published last month showed the January transfer window was dominated by English clubs who spent a total of €830 million ($878m) which accounted for 53% of global transfer spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That's certainly not the only reason why lots of money and records are being broken in the Premier League transfer window, but it's a contributing factor." The UK Home Office has a points-based Government Body Endorsement (GBE) system based on which clubs must apply to England's Football Association to sign players
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Some of this has nothing to do with the GBE system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's just that if you're outside Europe, we can't buy younger players in the same way that you could before, but it's partially to do with the GBE system." Chelsea were the biggest spenders having laid out more than £500m ($596m) in two windows since an investment group led by American Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took over the club in May last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I'm not here to defend the new owners who have owned the club for less than a year and had two transfer windows," Masters said

                Liverpool’s need for a midfield rebuild is well documented

            <p>
                It is clear that Liverpool could do with another defender joining to improve the team in case Van Dijk and Konate are both injured  in the future

                It is coincidental that Aguerd has been linked with a transfer to Liverpool after recently scoring an own goal

                For the most part, Aguerd has been a good signing for West Ham

                Some had also led Friday prayers without its prior approval, MAIDAM said on Thursday, without naming who the politicians are or which parties they belong to.  Terengganu is currently ruled by the Islamist party Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS).  “Sultan Mizan has expressed his disappointment that some politicians had given religious lectures or classes, and led Friday prayers without MAIDAM’s approval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Therefore, MAIDAM has decided to disallow all state assemblymen, Members of Parliament (MPs), and senators from delivering any religious lectures in mosques and surau in Terengganu,” said MAIDAM president Shaikh Harun Shaikh Ismail.  He added that all political leaders and activists are also not allowed to lead and deliver the Friday sermon in mosques as well as deliver religious talks without the council's permission
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To ensure these instructions are complied with, Mr Shaikh Harun said that the Terengganu religious affairs department has been tasked to monitor such activities.  MAIDAM stressed on Thursday that mosques and surau should never be misused to create anxiety, restlessness or discord among the community

                It stressed that mosques and surau that function well can bring a positive impact to the local Muslim community.  On Jan 18, Johor’s Crown Prince Tunku Ismail - who is the chairman of the state’s Islamic Religious Council - ordered that besides the ban on religious talks in mosques, all activities involving religious discourse as well as the speakers involved must first be approved by the relevant religious bodies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In other states, religious speakers have also been banned from or given stern warnings against preaching political messages in mosques.  According to Free Malaysia Today, the Kelantan Islamic and Malay Customs Council reminded mosque officials not to be involved in any political activities during the 15th General Elections (GE15) late last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Selangor, the state Islamic Religious Council in 2021 revoked the Islamic teaching certificate of political activists for fear that their certificate would be misused to benefit political parties.  News portal Malaysiakini reported that in 2019, Sultan Nazrin Shah of Perak called on religious preachers and accredited mosque committee members to relinquish their posts if they have any political agendas and ambitions, adding that such agendas would violate the sanctity of mosques as religious sites.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 — The Sessions Court here today allowed the temporary release of former Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng’s passport to enable him to travel to Singapore to attend his uncle’s funeral
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Azura Alwi allowed the application after hearing the arguments of lawyer Syafiqah Sofian who represented Guan Eng and deputy public prosecutor Farah Yasmin Salleh
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The court allowed the applicant’s (Guan Eng) application to obtain a passport release, however the applicant must return the passport within five days from March 5,” said the judge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Syafiqah in her argument said her client needed the passport to go to Singapore and he would leave for the country at 4.30pm tomorrow and would return on Sunday (March 5)
            </p>

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 ― Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim is suing Pendang Member of Parliament Datuk Awang Solahuddin Hashim over the latter’s defamatory remarks of the prime minister at the Parliament lobby last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar, 75, filed the suit through Messrs SN Nair & Partners at the High Court here around noon today and named Awang Solahuddin as the sole defendant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar claimed that Awang Solahuddin had uttered the defamatory remarks against him at a press conference at the Parliament lobby when attending the Dewan Rakyat sitting on February 21
            </p>

                “On February 21, 2023, the defamatory remarks from the audio and video footage were published or caused to be published by the defendant on TikTok using the account name @asriasri64chanel

            <p>
                He claimed that Awang Solahuddin had deliberately and maliciously uttered and published the defamatory remarks to incite the public and create personal hatred against the prime minister who is now leading the legitimate unity government and is committed to combating all forms of corruption
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Newcastle's takeover by a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was rubber-stamped in October 2021 after "legally binding assurances" that the Saudi government would have no control of the north-east club

                The new visa system put in place after Brexit is a contributory factor to Premier League clubs spending record sums on transfer fees as they find it more difficult to sign players at a younger age, the league's chief executive Richard Masters said on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A UEFA report published last month showed the January transfer window was dominated by English clubs who spent a total of €830 million ($878m) which accounted for 53% of global transfer spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That's certainly not the only reason why lots of money and records are being broken in the Premier League transfer window, but it's a contributing factor." The UK Home Office has a points-based Government Body Endorsement (GBE) system based on which clubs must apply to England's Football Association to sign players
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Some of this has nothing to do with the GBE system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's just that if you're outside Europe, we can't buy younger players in the same way that you could before, but it's partially to do with the GBE system." Chelsea were the biggest spenders having laid out more than £500m ($596m) in two windows since an investment group led by American Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took over the club in May last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I'm not here to defend the new owners who have owned the club for less than a year and had two transfer windows," Masters said

                Here is the Liverpool.com round-up of the latest transfer news surrounding the Reds today, with Chelsea star Mason Mount once again being linked with a move — this time with the Reds supposedly being 'increasingly confident'
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool is becoming 'increasingly confident' of signing Chelsea midfielder Mount in the summer, according to TalkSport, with the England international's contract talks at Stamford Bridge having gone nowhere
            </p>

                Here is the Liverpool.com round-up of the latest transfer news surrounding the Reds today, with Chelsea star Mason Mount once again being linked with a move — this time with the Reds supposedly being 'increasingly confident'
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool is becoming 'increasingly confident' of signing Chelsea midfielder Mount in the summer, according to TalkSport, with the England international's contract talks at Stamford Bridge having gone nowhere

                More info Manchester United could be tempted to pursue Napoli defender Kim Min-jae to provide depth in central defence following his impressive start to life in the Serie A
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Min-jae has been consistently linked with a move, and the sale of Maguire could prompt a pursuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United must improve a lot and someone like the Korean would be a suitable profile.” Min-jae has made 23 league appearances for Napoli so far this season, helping the club to the top of the table and being lauded as one of their most important players
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At 26, the defender has the potential to improve further and become an important figure for United, though it will come at a significant cost
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Min-jae currently has a £44million release clause that becomes active in the summer, though Napoli are working around the clock to strike a deal with their No 3 that will see that part of his contract removed, which would see his transfer value soar

                DONNY VAN DE BEEK has been urged to quit Manchester United this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the midfield flop should go back to Holland if he wants to save his career, says a former United star
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Van de Beek, 25, was rated as one of Europe’s top attacking midfielders when he swapped Ajax for United in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Van de Beek’s Old Trafford career has not gone to plan after a series of unfortunate injuries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And former United star Paul Parker reckons Van de Beek must leave Old Trafford this summer

                Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag is reminded by reporters to bring the Carabao Cup with him at the end of his press conference

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, March 3 — Transport operator SMRT has made a police report in the wake of a viral video which appears to show someone jamming open a platform screen door at an MRT station, preventing it from closing

            <p>
                Responding to TODAY’s queries, president of SMRT Trains Lam Sheau Kai said yesterday that on February 28 at about 5pm, a commuter on the east-bound station platform at Jurong East MRT station “deliberately prevented a platform screen door from closing”

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The person then claims that the video will be uploaded to YouTube, before retracting the claim

            <p>
                “I’m going to go far away so I’m not too much of a suspect,” says the voice behind the camera, backing off from the train door

                After about a minute’s delay, an SMRT staff runs over to the affected platform door, appearing to fix the issue caused

                Cuepacs president Datuk Adnan Mat (pic) said he was informed of the matter during a courtesy call on the newly-appointed Public Service director-general Datuk Dr Zulkapli Mohamed, on Thursday (March 2)

                Shares of troubled lender Silvergate (SI) fell as much as 35% Thursday morning after the company said late Wednesday it will miss a March 16 deadline to file its already-delayed annual report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bank said its team "requires additional time to perform analysis, record journal entries related to subsequent events and to complete management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting."

                Silvergate shares have collapsed over the last year as the company's entanglements with several crypto firms — including bankrupt exchange FTX, among others — resulted in deposits falling by more than two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year

                The free flight giveaway for customers in Singapore is part of a larger “Hello, Hong Kong” campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The giveaway for free round-trip tickets, first announced by the Hong Kong flag carrier, kicked off at noon on Thursday (March 2), and was meant to last till March 8

                About Us Advertise GEORGE TOWN, March 2 — The Penang High Court today dismissed four assemblymen’s application for an injunction to prevent the Penang state assembly from tabling a motion to vacate the seats until their appeal is heard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judicial Commissioner Azizan Md Arshad in his decision ruled that the courts have no power to interfere with the internal management of Parliament or any State Legislative Assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azizan further said the court has the power to grant an injunction to prevent any authority from doing something that is against the law, but at the same time, the court should also be careful not to exceed the jurisdiction given
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the plaintiffs had sought the court to use its discretion to prevent the duties of another body, namely the State Legislative Assembly which is also created under the State Constitution

            <p>
                "Just stick with the default 'RIP' if you don't have anything nice to say," one netizen commented
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "What kind of friend is this? Syed Saddiq posted about the death of his cat and Teresa commented something rude," another netizen said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, one netizen felt people shouldn't take the comment so seriously as it could just be banter between good friends
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kok's comment has since been deleted and both she and Syed Saddiq have yet to respond

                KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 — A primary care medical officer (MO) serving at a public health clinic in Selangor attributes staff shortages to the large number of programmes run by the Ministry of Health (MOH)

            <p>
                Too Many Programmes, But Too Few Staff Personally, I think we need more staff because we are running multiple programmes

            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have to have a strong number of staff, and we need to have strength when we want to raise awareness and when we want to give the best treatment to the community.  I think everybody in MOH has very good intentions to bring the best and spread good things to the community and to deliver the best health care service in the community
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Is it adequate with all the programmes that they are running and that they are planning to run in the future? Then they start to consider everything because we don’t want medical doctors only, we want specialist consultants in the health care system, in the government service

                This year, the company is unveiling what it calls the “second generation” of the electric hatchback, although that’s a bit of an exaggeration as this is more of a facelift
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen also offers a new Dark Olivine Green colour for the facelifted model, which comes with a black roof and matte silver trim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An ambient lighting system with 30 colours – the default is 10 – is also available

                His point was the Liverpool defender’s excellence underpinned the heroics of last season AND a Holland World Cup run, but he could easily have merely said wait and see…because Van Dijk had the perfect answer here at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was hardly a classic goal, Jose Sa feebly patting van Dijk’s initial header from a corner straight to Diogo Jota, who tapped the ball back to the big Dutchman to nod home on 73 minutes, but memorable for its impact

            <p>
                Just how important will ultimately be judged if they finish in the top four or not, but given the lack of confidence Liverpool displayed at times here, you wonder whether a draw would have killed any hope of catching Spurs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That seemed a long way away when Darwin Nunez had a goal ruled out for Jota’s foul on Max Kilman on 66 minutes, which seemed to sum up the home side’s luck
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool could argue that Jota had been pushed into Kilman, and so at least deserved a penalty, and there is some truth in that, but there was no way referee Paul Tierney was ever going to offer such a radical interpretation

                The question of whether Kulim International Airport (KXP) will replace Penang International Airport (PIA) has been a major infrastructure question playing in the minds of investors since 2015 at least

                Investments in fiduciary funds are often directed by the investor (client), and the fund manager’s role is to carry out the client’s instructions by implementing those instructions

                The witness also said the origins of the use of such fiduciary funds by companies such as 1MDB, SRC, Brazen Sky and Aabar could be traced back to a meeting he had in 2011 with fugitive businessman, Low Taek Jho, or better known as Jho Low, who had inquired about the inner workings of fiduciary funds with BSI

                With two years left until the completion of the Education Ministry’s Roadmap for English Language Education in Malaysia (2015-2025) reform plan, stakeholders say more needs to be done
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, more dual language programme schools need to open up for the English language to be applied even more in the classroom,” she said yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jobs, she said, required skills, and having a command of the English language was an asset to any potential employer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Highly Immersive Programme is specified in the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025 and is aimed at solving the poor language proficiency problem among students by involving and immersing them in an English language environment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Just strictly enforce the immersive and dual language programme, where students can opt for Mathematics and Science in English, and the level of English education will be enhanced,” Mak added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The English language requirement in the job market depends on the company’s needs; some don’t stress having fluency in English, but of course, a strong grasp of the language is still seen as an extra advantage,” she said

                With two years left until the completion of the Education Ministry’s Roadmap for English Language Education in Malaysia (2015-2025) reform plan, stakeholders say more needs to be done
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, more dual language programme schools need to open up for the English language to be applied even more in the classroom,” she said yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jobs, she said, required skills, and having a command of the English language was an asset to any potential employer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Highly Immersive Programme is specified in the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025 and is aimed at solving the poor language proficiency problem among students by involving and immersing them in an English language environment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Just strictly enforce the immersive and dual language programme, where students can opt for Mathematics and Science in English, and the level of English education will be enhanced,” Mak added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The English language requirement in the job market depends on the company’s needs; some don’t stress having fluency in English, but of course, a strong grasp of the language is still seen as an extra advantage,” she said
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

            <p>
                Mohamed Salah's 20th goal of the season boosted Liverpool's hopes of a top four finish Salah is rapidly closing in on a place in the top five in Liverpool's all-time scoring chart Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, right, has described Salah as a immaculate professional  Robbie Fowler (183) and Steven Gerrard (186) are the next figures whom Salah will leapfrog – already this season he has usurped Michael Owen and Sir Kenny Dalglish – and, when he does, he will have a place in the top five
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The importance of this game cannot be underestimated if Liverpool, somehow, are going to finish in the top four
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The perception around Salah this season is that he has taken it easier, having signed a new contract last July – the biggest Liverpool have ever awarded to a player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Salah is out of form with 20 goals, what is he going to be like when he really starts playing well? Liverpool are going to need every big character playing at maximum capacity for the next three months to reach the positions they want to be and Salah is firmly in that bracket

                The importance of this game cannot be underestimated if Liverpool, somehow, are going to finish in the top four
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The perception around Salah this season is that he has taken it easier, having signed a new contract last July – the biggest Liverpool have ever awarded to a player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Salah is out of form with 20 goals, what is he going to be like when he really starts playing well? Liverpool are going to need every big character playing at maximum capacity for the next three months to reach the positions they want to be and Salah is firmly in that bracket

                “Forever chemicals”, or PFAS, are found in cosmetics, non-stick cookware and waterproof clothing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The synthetic chemicals are present in soil and waterways across the globe, and a new study yesterday found that toilet paper “should be considered as a potentially major source” of PFAS in wastewater treatment systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The researchers said reducing PFAS in wastewater is “critical”, since the chemicals are potentially harmful

                They found that toilet paper contributed about four per cent of diPAPs in the United States and Canada, 35 per cent in Sweden and up to 89 per cent in France
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The study looked at toilet paper samples collected from November 2021 to August 2022

                They may not be enough to completely turn around this season for Liverpool but they turned around this game and for now that feels like more than enough
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With 17 minutes remaining Liverpool did not look winning this game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool were not particularly convincing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This, then, was Liverpool in a nutshell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Relief was to arrive for Liverpool, even if it was late

                Brentford striker Ivan Toney has admitted breaking English Football Association (FA) rules relating to betting prior to appearing before a disciplinary panel, sources have told ESPN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Toney has been charged with a total of 262 breaches between February 2017 and January 2021 when he was a player at Scunthorpe United, Wigan Athletic, Peterborough United and Brentford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Wednesday, Toney expressed his concern about the process and criticised the FA over what he perceives to be potential lapses of confidentiality as he prepares to argue his case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I was shocked and disappointed to see press speculation yesterday and today about The FA investigation process concerning me after I have been told by The FA that it is a confidential process until any decision has been made," Toney wrote on Instragam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FA rule E8 states that players "shall not bet, either directly or indirectly, or instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet on the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in or in connection with, a football match or competition; or any other matter concerning or related to football anywhere in the world, including, for example and without limitation, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters." Toney could face a substantial ban which could have a major impact on Brentford's season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Toney was called up to the England squad last September but did not play a single minute and was subsequently left out of Gareth Southgate's final 26-man group for the World Cup finals in November

                Star Australians combine for their 24th win of the season on Wednesday night, already double their previous best haul in a campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Purton’s 100th win of the season came aboard the Size-trained A Americ Te Specso at Happy Valley on Wednesday night, and after 49 of 88 meetings, the Australian remains on track to surpass Joao Moreira’s single-season Hong Kong record of 170 victories
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Purton hasn’t ridden more than nine winners for any other trainer this term, while Size’s next most prolific jockey is Alexis Badel on five

                Former Brazil forward Ronaldinho's son has signed a permanent contract with Barcelona's under-19 team, the Catalan club have announced
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ESPN reported in January that Joao Mendes de Assis Moreira, 18, was training with Barca's Juvenil A side pending a decision on whether to hand him a deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that Mendes' contract will run until summer next year, when the forward would exit the U19 age bracket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The teenager had been playing for Cruzeiro since he was 14 but rescinded his contract with the Brazilian side at the end of last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mendes' move to Barcelona will allow Ronaldinho to spend more time back in the city where he spent five years as a player, from 2003-08
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldinho, 42, has already been in Barcelona while his son has been on trial at Camp Nou and he turned out in Gerard Pique's Kings League last weekend

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that Mendes' contract will run until summer next year, when the forward would exit the U19 age bracket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The teenager had been playing for Cruzeiro since he was 14 but rescinded his contract with the Brazilian side at the end of last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mendes' move to Barcelona will allow Ronaldinho to spend more time back in the city where he spent five years as a player, from 2003-08
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldinho, 42, has already been in Barcelona while his son has been on trial at Camp Nou and he turned out in Gerard Pique's Kings League last weekend
            </p>

                With the optional E-Four all-wheel drive system, a second electric motor dubbed the 1WM with 41 PS (40 hp or 30 kW) and 84 Nm is added, increasing the system output to 199 PS (196 hp or 146 kW)

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 — Employers have been warned not to abuse the Foreign Worker Employment Relaxation Plan launched last Jan 17 by replacing local employees with foreign workers
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                This can tarnish the image of the country’s laws and because of that I am giving a stern warning to employers that if they apply to hire foreign workers, do it correctly.” “The act of a small group of irresponsible employers has tarnished the image and credibility of the country and it has made it difficult to negotiate with the source country on the needs of foreign workers,” he said

                "Thousands of residents in Felda Selancar are affected because this is the main road that connects them to many areas of Pahang and Johor

            <p>
                In the meantime, Ahmad Zahid, who is also the Central Disaster Management Committee chairman, said he was informed that over 100 students could not sit for the ongoing Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) on Wednesday as the examination papers could not be brought to the schools
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier Wednesday, Rompin OCPD Deputy Supt Mohd Azahari Mukhtar said a section of the road was believed to have collapsed at 4am and had to be closed to all vehicles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a related development, Ahmad Zahid hoped that residents in flood-prone areas would take precautions and adhere to authorities’ instructions to avoid untoward incidents as the Malaysian Meteorological Department has issued continuous rain warning for many areas

                PTPTN said it covers a 20% discount on the remaining debt for full settlement of the loan; a 15% discount for the settlement of at least 50% of the total outstanding debt with the remainder through salary deduction or scheduled direct debit repayment; in addition to a 5% discount for repayment through the myPTPTN application

            <p>
                It also said that borrowers wanting to make a full settlement of the loan or 50% of the remaining debt must verify the loan balance, through the myPTPTN application or PTPTN's official portal at www.ptptn.gov.my or contact the PTPTN marketing executive, before making repayments through available payment channels

            <p>
                Meanwhile, PTPTN also said that borrowers who are in the repayment period and have a monthly income of RM1,800 (gross salary) or below, are eligible to apply for payment deferment, except for borrowers who have participated in the Debt Management Programme (DMP) under the Credit Counselling and Debt Management Agency (AKPK) for PTPTN loans

                FBI Director Christopher Wray believes the COVID-19 pandemic was "most likely" caused by an incident in a laboratory in Wuhan, China

            <p>
                FBI Director Christopher Wray told Fox News on Tuesday that the Bureau has now assessed the source of COVID-19 was "most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan"

            <p>
                In Tuesday's interview, Wray also accused the Chinese government of trying to stall US efforts to investigate the causes of the pandemic

                The Prime Minister applauded Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr for making great strides to ensure the peace process in Mindanao would be successful
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The peace process has to succeed, because it not only affects the Philippines and Malaysia but also the region," he said at a joint press briefing after holding a bilateral meeting with Marcos at Malacanang Palace here Wednesday (March 1)
            </p>

                The prime minister said Malaysia remained committed to playing a constructive role in the peace process in Mindanao

            <p>
                According to Anwar, there are immense opportunities to be reaped by both countries should efforts to attain peace in Mindanao succeed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Philippines, according to him, recognised the great contribution that Malaysia had made to the peace process in southern Philippines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He hoped the support shown by Malaysia would continue to contribute to the success of the peace process and the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region

                The Prime Minister applauded Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr for making great strides to ensure the peace process in Mindanao would be successful
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The peace process has to succeed, because it not only affects the Philippines and Malaysia but also the region," he said at a joint press briefing after holding a bilateral meeting with Marcos at Malacanang Palace here Wednesday (March 1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister said Malaysia remained committed to playing a constructive role in the peace process in Mindanao
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Anwar, there are immense opportunities to be reaped by both countries should efforts to attain peace in Mindanao succeed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Philippines, according to him, recognised the great contribution that Malaysia had made to the peace process in southern Philippines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He hoped the support shown by Malaysia would continue to contribute to the success of the peace process and the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region

                Kevin, 58, is the former head of Wealth Management Services at BSI Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 44th prosecution witness in the trial, he testified to how Jho Low had heaped pressure on BSI bank over the transfers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An example of such haste by Jho Low involved 1MDB Global Investment Ltd (1MDBGIL), a 1MDB linked company which opened a bank account with BSI Bank and parked its funds under fiduciary funds under Jho Low, before transferring the money out to bank accounts linked to him elsewhere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kevin then testified of how approximately US$2.721 billion had entered 1MDBGIL’s fiduciary fund account and how most of it was transferred out at the behest of Jho Low the very next day through several transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In fact, various employees in BSI bank were put under tremendous pressure by the clients (specifically, the pressure was applied by Jho Low on Yak, who in turn pressured various departments in the bank) to expedite processes, so that the money flow from 1MDBGIL (and other 1MDB related client accounts) was transferred as quickly as possible from the BSI bank account to the account of the fiduciary fund and then on to the account of the target company,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because Jho Low had rushed these transactions, from the US$2.721 billion, a sum of US$1,060,606,065 was paid into the account of two other fiduciary funds with BSI under Jho Low, namely Devonshire Funds Ltd and EEMF

            <p>
                Because Jho Low had rushed these transactions, from the US$2.721 billion, a sum of US$1,060,606,065 was paid into the account of two other fiduciary funds with BSI under Jho Low, namely Devonshire Funds Ltd and EEMF

                CelcomDigi has announced an extension of its free 5G trial access until April 30 this year for its Celcom network, while introducing its new 5G Booster add-on for Digi users

                A full list of eligible plans is available on an FAQ page on the Digi website

                Meanwhile, the Celcom network 5G trial will still be available for postpaid users subscribed to the Celcom Mega Lightning plan 80, 98, 128, 158, 188 and Family Line, along with the Xpax Postpaid 40 and 60 plans

            <p>

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 1 — Maybank denied today that its cybersecurity system had been compromised after a Sarawakian man claimed he lost RM1 million to a supposed mobile phone scam by the “Macau syndicate”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bank said the fund was safely returned to the account holder, a businessman by the name Lee, after it carried out an investigation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Maybank refers to the recent incident involving a customer that allegedly claimed to have had funds taken out of his account without his authorisation,” the bank’s corporate communication said in a statement

                Judge Ahmad Faizadh Yahaya meted out the fine on Muhaimi Nabil Muatnan, 35, for using his mobile phone's Telegram account to post pornographic video with the intention of annoying others

                Muhaimi Nabil who lives in Kuantan was charged under Section 233(1)(a) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 which provides a fine of not more than RM50,000 or imprisonment for up to one year or both, upon conviction

            <p>
                A warrant of arrest had been issued against Muhaimi Nabil after he failed to present himself in court when the case came up for mention last Jan 26, and today he arrived in court accompanied by the police
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked the reason for the absence, Muhaimi Nabil said he was involved in a road crash in Bentong on that day, but did not lodge a report on the incident

                Kevin Michael Swampillai, a former banker of the BSI Singapore bank which has since been shut down, said he now believes the fiduciary funds were used by 1MDB and SRC to hide financial transactions from Malaysia’s scrutiny

                Swampillai also cited Low Taek Jho’s indications to BSI Bank that he was an “adviser to Najib”, with the BSI former banker saying this was told to him by his bank superiors and by Yak

                Besides that, Mohd Rafizi said the government should look at GST as a better tax collection mechanism and not a mechanism for it to collect more taxes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to him, in other countries, when the people’s income reached a level that is high, a majority of the people would pay income tax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In comparison, the approach to collect income tax is more difficult than GST as GST is collected by traders for the government, so it does not need assessment and so forth,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that when the government switched from income tax to GST, the income tax rate would be reduced because the transition to GST is not to collect additional tax but because it is a better approach to collect tax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We need to reach that level (better income for the people) first (before implementing GST)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, in a situation where majority of the people is still not in that bracket (to pay income tax), and if we implement GST, the group with income that is not taxable will have to do so,” he further said

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In comparison, the approach to collect income tax is more difficult than GST as GST is collected by traders for the government, so it does not need assessment and so forth,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that when the government switched from income tax to GST, the income tax rate would be reduced because the transition to GST is not to collect additional tax but because it is a better approach to collect tax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We need to reach that level (better income for the people) first (before implementing GST)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, in a situation where majority of the people is still not in that bracket (to pay income tax), and if we implement GST, the group with income that is not taxable will have to do so,” he further said

            </p>

                The United board backed their manager last summer to rectify the errors made under Solskjaer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Ten Hag clearly wants to build a dynasty of his own at Old Trafford and Solskjaer's reign will act as a warning to the Dutchman in terms of the club's transfer business

                Liverpool already knows the best alternative if Jude Bellingham proves out of reach this summer, with a midfielder matching Trent Alexander-Arnold catching the eye
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One player, though, who may be available for far less than Bellingham is Inter Milan's Nicolò Barella

            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Herein lies an important contrast to Bellingham
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So while they aren't the same, Barella is still the best Plan B in terms of the impact he could make at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The playmaking impact of Alexander-Arnold is currently unmatched at Liverpool, and having a version of him in the middle of the park would be a very dangerous weapon

                Liverpool already knows the best alternative if Jude Bellingham proves out of reach this summer, with a midfielder matching Trent Alexander-Arnold catching the eye
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One player, though, who may be available for far less than Bellingham is Inter Milan's Nicolò Barella
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Herein lies an important contrast to Bellingham
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So while they aren't the same, Barella is still the best Plan B in terms of the impact he could make at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The playmaking impact of Alexander-Arnold is currently unmatched at Liverpool, and having a version of him in the middle of the park would be a very dangerous weapon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barella is special, and Liverpool should be thankful that he's not generating the hype he deserves

                By Ambar Warrick Investing.com--Chinese business activity grew more than expected in February, rising past pre-COVID levels as an economic recovery in the country gained momentum after the relaxing of most anti-COVID restrictions this year.  The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’s Index (PMI) rose 52.6 in February, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The figure was higher than expectations for a reading of 50.5, and January’s figure of 50.1.  China’s Non-manufacturing PMI fared far better, rising 56.3 in February- more than expectations for growth of 55.0, and well above than the prior month’s reading of 54.4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Strength in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity saw China’s composite PMI jump 56.4 in February- its fastest pace in over three years

                The Caixin Manufacturing PMI read 51.6 for the month, more than expectations of 50.2 and well above the 49.2 seen in January.  The survey, which focuses on smaller, private industries, indicates that a manufacturing recovery was broad-based in February.  “Both manufacturing supply and demand expanded last month, as production gradually returned to normal while both domestic and external demand improved after a COVID policy shift," Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group said in a note.   The non-manufacturing sector was boosted by pent-up demand for services after three years of zero-COVID

                Liverpool reportedly has a new transfer priority, with Jürgen Klopp having identified a midfielder who looks a good fit to ultimately succeed Thiago Alcântara
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, it is likely that Liverpool could add more established midfielders to its squad ahead of next season — especially with rumored top target in this area of the pitch, Jude Bellingham, being only 19

            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! In a sense, Barella's playing style is likely to draw comparisons with Thiago Alcântara, who at his best in a Liverpool shirt has demonstrated similar qualities

            <p>
                Thiago will be 32 by the start of the next campaign and is out of contract at the end of next season and it would make perfect sense for the Reds to be forward-planning at this stage

            <p>
                However a deal was structured, not only would Liverpool be signing a player with bags of experience, they would also potentially be adding a long-term replacement for Thiago Alcântara to the squad

            <p>
                In many ways, this would represent the kind of astute foresight which paid such dividends for Liverpool during early days of Klopp at the club.

                Dr Wee, who is MCA president, also suggested gradually increasing the proposed RM12,000 individual relief to RM15,000 in three years

                Dr Wee said the government must accurately identify “target groups” in its plans to give the RM500 EPF contribution

            <p>
                “In addition, the RM500 contribution should not include inactive EPF members, as they may no longer reside in Malaysia or they may be a permanent resident, who should not be accepting the contribution.”

                Chelsea will be without a key defender in a pivotal week for Potter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Silva were unavailable for six weeks it would also rule him out of Chelsea’s matches against Leicester and Everton before the international break and four more games at the start of April

            <p>
                Chelsea also have several full backs who have deputised at centre back in the past

            <p>
                Chelsea have kept faith with Potter despite two wins in 15 games, a run which has left them 26 points behind leaders Arsenal

                Arteta urged Potter not to let abuse and bad results ‘destroy his life’

                At the moment, Kvara does not want to make ant statements about his future but the feeling is clear - in Italy he will only be playing for Napoli or will accept a lucrative contract from abroad.  These are exceptionally good times for Napoli but the player may be tempted by a big move Both Kvaratskhelia and striker Victor Osimhen will have plenty of interest come the summer It would be impossible to imagine Kvara in Napoli until 2028 but if the player accepted the renewal of the contract, his raised market value would only favour the club

                What Are RMDs? You don’t pay taxes on the money in your IRA or 401(k) when you put it in, which is why these accounts are considered tax-advantaged retirement accounts

                Manchester United won silverware for the first time since 2017 with victory over Newcastle at Wembley
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a memorable occasion for Erik ten Hag and his players and there could be more to come this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They only have a three per cent chance of bridging the gap and picking up their first title since legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal are 53 per cent likely to reign supreme
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United are 85 per cent sure to clinch a top-four finish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, they are viewed by FiveThirtyEight as 16 per cent shots to back up their domestic success here and 28 per cent certain to reach the Budapest showpiece

                Australia’s Avalon International Air Show, which began April 28, exhibits a wide range of new defense technologies, including a new Australian-made lethal drone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unmanned aerial technology is already establishing itself as a major air show theme

            <p>
                Designed to be transported in shipping containers, the uncrewed air system was created by BAE Systems Australia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The designers of this UAV believe that the deadly drone may be produced locally within three years.  The STRIX, developed by BAE Systems and Perth-based Innovaero, is Australia’s first domestically designed, manufactured, and armed VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) uncrewed air system (UAS), according to the company.  The firm said that the partnership merges Innovaero’s experience in designing and manufacturing aerospace products for the Australian market with BAE Systems’ expertise in autonomous platforms and its vehicle management system (VMS) technology

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another Australian-designed uncrewed system, called MQ-28A ‘Ghost Bat,’ was publicly unveiled during the 2019 Avalon Airshow after being discreetly developed by aerospace giant Boeing in cooperation with the RAAF and the Defense Department.
