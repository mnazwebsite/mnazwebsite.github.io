            <p>
                They’re pushing, in numbers that threaten the Government’s 80-seat majority, for Hunt to announce in the Budget that corporation tax is staying put
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And on top of that,” says Steve, “corporation tax is going up, if ministers are stupid enough to do it – just as our energy costs rise even more.” Corporation tax is payable on profits above £50,000, with the full rate paid above £250,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If corporation tax was frozen in April, far from rebelling – as they did under Truss in September – I reckon financial markets would cheer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The great thing about freezing a tax that’s been expected to rise, is that it feels like a tax cut

                Snickers and M&M’s maker Mars Wrigley has been fined by US safety regulators after two workers at one of its factories fell into a vat of chocolate

                The contractors found themselves in a sticky situation while working on a batching tank, which is used to mix ingredients for chocolate

                The tank was filled waist-high with chocolate to make Dove, a brand sold in the US that is labelled Galaxy in the UK and elsewhere

            <p>
                The South Jakarta court ruled Ferdy Sambo, the former police chief of internal affairs, guilty of the planned murder of junior police officer Nofriansyah Yosua Hutabarat, Judge Wahyu Iman Santoso said on Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furious, Ferdy summoned another subordinate, junior police officer Richard Eliezer Pudihang Lumliu, 24, and asked if he “had the guts to shoot” Nofriansyah
            </p>

                Former Indonesian police inspector-general Ferdy Sambo at his trial in Jakarta on Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The South Jakarta court ruled Ferdy Sambo, the former police chief of internal affairs, guilty of the planned murder of junior police officer Nofriansyah Yosua Hutabarat, Judge Wahyu Iman Santoso said on Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furious, Ferdy summoned another subordinate, junior police officer Richard Eliezer Pudihang Lumliu, 24, and asked if he “had the guts to shoot” Nofriansyah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ferdy told Richard that Nofriansyah had insulted him and that he “must die”, Judge Wahyu told the court

                In his attack which seems to zero in on PH, Abdul Hadi however did not mention the other components in the current government — such as Barisan Nasional (BN) — which has Muslim MPs

                Hadi claimed that the “unity government” tag was inaccurate as the term should be used to describe a situation when there is no or minor opposition in the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysiakini had included a chart of the composition of government MPs which it tallied to be 148, which showed 50 being Malays, 27 being Muslim Bumiputera from East Malaysia, 43 Chinese, 16 non-Muslim Bumiputera from East Malaysia, 12 Indians and other non-Bumiputeras
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The news portal noted that there is actually a “balanced” composition of government MPs in terms of religious affiliations, with 52 per cent of government MPs being Muslims and the remaining 48 per cent being non-Muslims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Out of the 135 government MPs in Thevesh’s data set, 84 of them are Bumiputera, which translates to 62.2 per cent or almost two-thirds.

                In his attack which seems to zero in on PH, Abdul Hadi however did not mention the other components in the current government — such as Barisan Nasional (BN) — which has Muslim MPs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taken together, the unity government has more Muslim MPs than he suggested
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hadi claimed that the “unity government” tag was inaccurate as the term should be used to describe a situation when there is no or minor opposition in the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysiakini had included a chart of the composition of government MPs which it tallied to be 148, which showed 50 being Malays, 27 being Muslim Bumiputera from East Malaysia, 43 Chinese, 16 non-Muslim Bumiputera from East Malaysia, 12 Indians and other non-Bumiputeras
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The news portal noted that there is actually a “balanced” composition of government MPs in terms of religious affiliations, with 52 per cent of government MPs being Muslims and the remaining 48 per cent being non-Muslims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Out of the 135 government MPs in Thevesh’s data set, 84 of them are Bumiputera, which translates to 62.2 per cent or almost two-thirds.

            <p>

                A MACC source said the contractors were identified following the anti-graft agency’s investigation into several accounts belonging to Bersatu that were frozen at the end of last month
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Despite restructuring 29 trillion rupiah (RM8.27bil) of bank loans in 2021, Waskita Karya has appealed to Jakarta for a fresh capital injection

                Singapore lenders are set to report their highest quarterly net interest margins in more than a decade on rising interest rates but as the cycle peaks and economic growth falters, profit growth will be curbed, analysts said

            <p>
                DBS Chief Executive Piyush Gupta said in the bank's results statement that interest rate increases are likely to moderate, but he doesn't expect rate cuts this year

            <p>
                The Singapore-based bank warned that there was a downside risk of 5 to 7 basis points to the group's peak net interest margin guidance of 2.25% due to factors including outflows to treasury bills and a strengthening Singapore dollar

            <p>
                DBS, the first Singapore bank to report this season, said October-December net profit rose to a record 2.34 billion Singapore dollars ($1.76 billion) compared with an average estimate of S$2.16 billion from three analysts, according to Refinitiv data, and S$1.39 billion in the same period a year earlier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DBS reported a total net interest margin, a key gauge of profitability, of 2.05% for the latest quarter, up from 1.43% in the same period a year earlier

                Opposition leader Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin said the bloc understood that the government could not deliver on some promises and was willing to work together, but wanted to “formalise whatever issues and things that we are supposed to work for”

                “But that does not mean that as the Opposition, I do not have the right to give my comments and question the government,” he said

                “We are going to be an effective Opposition, and we are going to work for the people,” he said

                “This is not about me, and I would like to see what I always do here is actually meant for the nation,” he said, adding that he would not only raise the people’s concerns but also give constructive ideas to the government.

                About Us Advertise LEEDS, Feb 13 — Erik ten Hag hailed Marcus Rashford as one of Europe’s best forwards after his late goal inspired Manchester United’s 2-0 win against old rivals Leeds on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Rashford scored to spark United’s comeback from two goals down in Wednesday’s 2-2 draw with Leeds, he tormented the Yorkshire club once again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford netted with 10 minutes left at Elland Road to make it four successive Premier League games with a goal for the England forward, who has scored in eight of his last nine appearances in the competition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When he is keeping the investment and keeps the focus in every game and brings the energy and belief, he will keep scoring.” United’s win was just their second in their last five league games, although they have now lost just once in their last 17 matches in all competitions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bitter rivals  Amid a cacophonous noise at Elland Road, Leeds made a frenzied start, with Crysencio Summerville firing over after a mistake from United left-back Tyrell Malacia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After scoring United’s equaliser against Leeds in midweek, Jadon Sancho had been rewarded with his first league start since October, but the England forward was largely anonymous and came off after an hour

            </p>

                Canada described it as cylindrical and smaller than the initial balloon

            <p>
                What has been recovered?  Military teams working from planes, boats and minisubs are scouring the shallow waters off South Carolina for the first object, and military images showed the recovery of a large piece of balloon
            </p>

                No information was immediately available about recovery of the fourth object

            <p>
                What was the objects’ purpose?  US officials say images of the first balloon show it had surveillance equipment that could intercept telecommunications

                Enter Fidelity’s 45% rule, which states that your retirement savings should generate about 45% of your pretax, pre-retirement income each year, with Social Security benefits covering the rest of your spending needs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can analyze your income needs and help you plan for retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fidelity’s 45% guideline dictates that a retiree’s nest egg should be large enough to replace 45% of their pre-retirement, pretax income each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pre-Retirement Income Plays an Important Role But all retirement spending plans aren’t equal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, the average retiree will need to replace between 55% and 80% of his pre-retirement, pretax income to maintain his current lifestyle

                Enter Fidelity’s 45% rule, which states that your retirement savings should generate about 45% of your pretax, pre-retirement income each year, with Social Security benefits covering the rest of your spending needs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can analyze your income needs and help you plan for retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fidelity’s 45% guideline dictates that a retiree’s nest egg should be large enough to replace 45% of their pre-retirement, pretax income each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pre-Retirement Income Plays an Important Role But all retirement spending plans aren’t equal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, the average retiree will need to replace between 55% and 80% of his pre-retirement, pretax income to maintain his current lifestyle

                Azmin lost the Gombak parliamentary seat after obtaining 59,538 votes, losing to his former protege Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was considered a surprising defeat for Azmin, the International Trade and Industry Minister in the caretaker government, who won the seat in 2018 with 75,113 votes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had held the seat since 2008
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is still the Bukit Antarabangsa assemblyman as Selangor has yet to dissolve its state assembly.

                Previously, the documentation process of some 1,400 vehicles could be done in one hour and after the QRT was introduced, he said, the department could now process up to 2,300 vehicles within the same period

                Khairul Dzaimee added that allowing Singaporeans to use the e-gate at the CIQ has contributed to the overall improvement

                Operations to the WTPs resumed at 6.30am on Sunday (Feb 12) after the raw water was re-channelled to the Rantau Panjang plants at 1.30am and the Sungai Selangor Phase 1,2, 3 WTPs at 2.15am following three subsequent scent detection tests which rendered readings of 0 ton each time on Sunday

                China's Wu Yibing in action during the 2022 US Open
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wu said that kind of history wasn't on his mind against Fritz, nor was he even thinking ahead to a victory that lined up a title clash with fifth-seeded American John Isner
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Fritz managed to pull out a first set that lasted 58 minutes, Wu had to fight off five break points in the fourth game, and was down 0-30 in the 10th game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He managed to hold serve, break Fritz and hold again to pocket the set, and made a break in the fifth game of the third set stand up for his first career win over a top-10 player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Isner's big serve helped him overcome an otherwise sluggish performance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without that I would have been dusted off the court 6-3, 6-4," Isner said.

                The bizarre “diagnosis” has meant that since 2020, his family has developed a strange tradition, following each Lunar New Year holiday, his mother takes him to see a psychiatrist

                People fill up sandbags at a public collection point in preparation for the arrival of Cyclone Gabrielle in Auckland, New Zealand, Feb 12, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gabrielle, downgraded to a sub-tropical low pressure system from a Category 2 cyclone, hit Norfolk Island on Saturday night, with its most destructive winds missing the island, before tracking to New Zealand, 1,460km (910 miles) south

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wind and rain were spreading from the country's north, with a 140kmh (87 miles per hour) wind gust reported on the country's North Island on Sunday afternoon, MetService said.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The storm was on track to lie off Cape Reinga at the North Island's north end on Sunday afternoon, after moving away from Norfolk Island, MetService said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Norfolk Island, which covers just over 34 sq km (13 square miles) in the Pacific Ocean between New Caledonia and New Zealand, authorities said they were clearing debris and trees from roads and restoring power knocked out in the storm

                People fill up sandbags at a public collection point in preparation for the arrival of Cyclone Gabrielle in Auckland, New Zealand, Feb 12, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gabrielle, downgraded to a sub-tropical low pressure system from a Category 2 cyclone, hit Norfolk Island on Saturday night, with its most destructive winds missing the island, before tracking to New Zealand, 1,460km (910 miles) south
            </p>
            
            <p>
                New Zealand's North Island and its largest city Auckland braced for the storm's full impact from Sunday night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wind and rain were spreading from the country's north, with a 140kmh (87 miles per hour) wind gust reported on the country's North Island on Sunday afternoon, MetService said.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The storm was on track to lie off Cape Reinga at the North Island's north end on Sunday afternoon, after moving away from Norfolk Island, MetService said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Norfolk Island, which covers just over 34 sq km (13 square miles) in the Pacific Ocean between New Caledonia and New Zealand, authorities said they were clearing debris and trees from roads and restoring power knocked out in the storm

                “Canadian and US aircraft were scrambled, and a US F-22 successfully fired at the object,“ Trudeau tweeted Saturday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Trudeau said that Canadian forces in the Yukon “will now recover and analyze the wreckage of the object.” He said he spoke with US President Joe Biden over the latest incursion, while Canada's defense minister also said she spoke with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin

                US and Canadian planes flew together to take on the object Saturday, the US Department of Defense said

                “President Biden authorized US fighter aircraft assigned to North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to work with Canada to take down a high-altitude airborne object over northern Canada today,“ Pentagon Spokesman Pat Ryder said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The White House said Biden and Trudeau spoke Saturday, and “commended NORAD’s and US Northern Command’s strong and effective partnership and agreed to continue their close coordination to detect, track, and defend our airspace.” The object taken out Saturday was shot down over the Yukon, which borders Alaska, where fighter jets downed another object Friday, off the US state's north coast near the village of Deadhorse

            <p>
                Search and recovery operations for the remains of that object continued Saturday but were hindered by Arctic “wind chill, snow, and limited daylight,“ Northern Command said in a statement

                Liverpool are expected to 'back Jurgen Klopp to revamp his squad this summer' It comes after a shocking start to the season that has seen Liverpool slump to 10th after 20 league games The Times also claim Liverpool will be buoyed by the introduction of a new head of eesearch, as the club has already picked a candidate who is 'working in the game and regarded as a leading operator in the football data field.' They will replace Dr Ian Graham in the role, who may prove a tough act to follow as he is credited with masterminding a number of Liverpool's key signings in the last decade, including that of Klopp

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, Feb 12 — Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak (PBDS) believes Datuk Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi has ‘opened a can of worms’ by suggesting a quota system based on ethnicity for the recruitment of Sarawak civil servants

            <p>
                PBDS president Bobby William said barring that Nanta was not misquoted, it is true that non-Malays, especially the Dayaks, are being marginalised when it comes to recruitment of officers in the Sarawak civil service

                The Gunners thought they had secured a vital victory when January signing Leandro Trossard bagged his first goal for the club, but Ivan Toney's close-range header placed a dent in Arsenal's title hopes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it has since emerged Christian Norgaard was in an offside position when he assisted Toney's header

            <p>
                "However, in the build-up to the goal, Christian Norgaard — whose cross it is that Toney heads in — is in an offside position

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The result could have huge consequences for Arsenal when it comes to the race for the title

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, Feb 12 — The odour pollution incident which forced four water treatment plants (LRAs) in the state to be shut down temporarily last night was caused by a fuel spill, believed to be diesel from heavy machinery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                State Tourism, Environment, Green Technology and Orang Asli Affairs Committee chairman Hee Loy Sian said the Selangor Water Management Authority’s (LUAS) investigation along Sungai Selangor found the oil spill at the river bank some three kilometres away from the Rantau Panjang LRA intake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hee said the temporary shutdown of the LRAs intake points for around four hours was a control and preventive measure to avoid worse pollution to the water treatment system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The problem was quickly addressed with the channelling of raw water starting at 10 pm yesterday and lowering the barrage gates at the LRA intake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Hee said that raw water was channelled back to the Rantau Panjang LRA intake at 1.30am and at 2.15am today to the Sungai Selangor Phase 1 (SSP1) LRA, Sungai Selangor Phase 2 (SSP2) LRA and Selangor Phase 3 (SSP3) LRA after recording three consecutive zero TON readings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Pengurusan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd (Air Selangor) announced the temporary shutdown of the Rantau Panjang, SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3 LRAs believed due to an odour pollution incident, causing unscheduled water supply disruptions in eight regions

                Chelsea boss Graham Potter has said some of the club's new signings need to adapt to the Premier League, with the club's January spending spree yet to turn around their poor form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw against West Ham United on Saturday, with Atletico Madrid loanee Joao Felix scoring his first goal for the club before former Chelsea fullback Emerson levelled the game shortly after
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The result means Chelsea have won just once in their last eight matches in all competitions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "You can also see the potential of the team but you can also see where the work is, which is getting Reece James up to speed, which is getting Ben Chilwell up to speed, which is getting Ruben Loftus-Cheek up to speed, which is getting Wesley Fofana up to speed, which is getting N'Golo Kante up to speed, which is adapting [Myhailo] Mudryk into the Premier League, which is adapting [Noni] Madueke into the Premier League, which adapting Benoit Badiashile into the Premier League, which is adapting Joao Felix into the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That's just how it is, that's the way I see it and I'll just be honest to say how it is but I completely understand that people are frustrated if you don't win." Chelsea made eight signings in January and, due to their inflated squad, had to leave defender Badiashile and striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang out of their Champions League roster
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Then you have to have honest conversations and respect the fact that players will be disappointed, because that's normal." Chelsea are ninth in the Premier League table after Saturday's draw and restart their Champions League campaign at Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.

                Liverpool, Barcelona and plenty of others are reportedly looking at a Bundesliga playmaker whose contract is running down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jürgen Klopp should be all over a move
            </p>

                Fede Valverde and Lucas Paquetá also feature in the top 10, while Liverpool-linked Mason Mount is third

            <p>
                As a risk-free signing who could add quality and depth to prove a masterstroke, it is exactly the type of signing that facilitated Liverpool going for all four trophies last season — and exactly the type of player they should target again.

                About Us Advertise SYDNEY, Feb 12 — Residents of New Zealand’s biggest city were urged today to prepare for the impact of a storm that buffeted Australia’s Norfolk Island overnight

                Gabrielle, downgraded to a sub-tropical low pressure system from a Category 2 cyclone, hit Norfolk Island on Saturday night, with its most destructive winds missing the island, before tracking to New Zealand, 1,460 kilometres south

                Wind and rain were spreading from the country’s north, with a 140km per hour wind gust reported on the country’s North Island on Sunday afternoon, MetService said

            <p>

            <p>
                On Norfolk Island, which covers just over 34 square km in the Pacific Ocean between New Caledonia and New Zealand, authorities said they were clearing debris and trees from roads and restoring power knocked out in the storm

                Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~30% potential total return profile

                The comic irony is that Lim is home.  Peter Lim is in Singapore, not in Valencia where the proud club he owns totters from one crisis season to the next and is now on the brink of a relegation battle. This Saturday another huge protest is planned.  The team is due to kick-off its home game with Athletic Bilbao at 9pm local time

                The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) Peninsular Malaysia was on Saturday reported to have called on the ministry  to postpone  the use of the IDME which was not stable, apart from claiming that it was not viable yet to fill in the scores of the Final Academic Session (UASA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The IDME, developed by the ministry, is accessed by a single login through its website, and all educators who fill out the UASA and classroom assessment must go through the IDME system, that is, they need to log in to the system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time,  Fadhlina reiterated that the start of the new school calendar will return to January but not in the near future as the justifications must be resolved according to the Education Act 1996 and economic issues and teacher workload would have to be taken into consideration

                Members of the ISAR Germany (International Search and Rescue) react after learning that Zeynep, the woman they rescued the day before, has died, as the search for survivors continues, in the aftermath of a deadly earthquake in Kirikhan, Turkey February 11, 2023

                Fabio Quartararo has confirmed that Yamaha have supplied him with two new engine specifications at the Sepang MotoGP Test, which is the same number as last year’s Misano test

            <p>
                The 2021 MotoGP champion, who was one of the quickest in terms of top speed on day one, found yet more speed on day two whilst also moving up the leaderboard when it came to overall lap times.  Following an 11th place finish on Friday, Quartararo ended day two less than two tenths away from Jorge Martin after finishing fourth fastest.  "Today was a positive day even if we just had a few laps [in the dry]," said Quartararo

                In general, my last run with more than 20 laps on the tyre I was riding pretty fast.  "I’m happy about the day and hopefully tomorrow the weather is better and we can try some new tyres

            <p>
                He said to overcome the problem, his ministry together with the Ministry of Home Affairs (KDN) and the Ministry of Human Resources are working to increase the number of workers in the agricultural sector and other sectors

            <p>
                “My ministry is dealing with it (the problem of chicken egg supply), indeed every time before a festival, the consumption of chicken eggs is higher, this problem of egg shortage is also faced by other countries

                Experts say Türkiye has the regulations in place to prevent such a catastrophe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Officials say 12,141 buildings were either destroyed or seriously damaged in Türkiye

                Even if a building topples, people can usually hide until searchers can rescue them, he said

            <p>
                Türkiye's rules on construction, based on California's, have been regularly revised since a 1999 tremor in northwestern Türkiye
            </p>

                Ukraine has reacted furiously to the International Olympic Committee's announcement last month that it was exploring a "pathway" to allow Russian and Belarusian competitors to take part in the Paris Games, under a neutral flag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zelenskyy argued that very few Russian athletes had spoken out against the war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Russia is now a country that stains everything with blood - even the white flag." At least 228 Ukrainian athletes and coaches died during the Russian invasion, Zelenskyy said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his letter to the Ukrainian National Olympic Committee that was made public on Thursday, Bach said Ukraine's efforts to "pressure" other countries to boycott the 2024 Paris Games were "extremely regrettable"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "However, the situation in Ukraine has not changed since the IOC's initial decision last February on banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from competition," she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As long as Putin continues his war, Russia and Belarus must not be allowed to compete on the world stage or be represented at the Olympics." Poland suggested including Russian and Belarusian athletes that have opposed Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in the Refugee Team for the Paris Olympics

                Ukraine has reacted furiously to the International Olympic Committee's announcement last month that it was exploring a "pathway" to allow Russian and Belarusian competitors to take part in the Paris Games, under a neutral flag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zelenskyy argued that very few Russian athletes had spoken out against the war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Russia is now a country that stains everything with blood - even the white flag." At least 228 Ukrainian athletes and coaches died during the Russian invasion, Zelenskyy said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his letter to the Ukrainian National Olympic Committee that was made public on Thursday, Bach said Ukraine's efforts to "pressure" other countries to boycott the 2024 Paris Games were "extremely regrettable"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "However, the situation in Ukraine has not changed since the IOC's initial decision last February on banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from competition," she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As long as Putin continues his war, Russia and Belarus must not be allowed to compete on the world stage or be represented at the Olympics." Poland suggested including Russian and Belarusian athletes that have opposed Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in the Refugee Team for the Paris Olympics

                Malaysia’s mixed economic performance is not surprising
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a briefing to reporters, she says that sustained domestic demand and spending are set to continue anchoring growth this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The growth was still above the long-term average of 5.1%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the quarter-on-quarter contraction in 4Q22, Nor Shamsiah says it was due to the exceptionally high growth in the previous third quarter.She points out that the contraction reflects “temporary slowdown” in Malaysia’s growth momentum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In terms of the drivers of growth private consumption fell 2.9%, investment was flat at only 0.3% growth and government expenditure fell by 5.4% as the pre-election boom ended,” he says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Nor Shamsiah foresees domestic demand to remain as key driver of growth, amid the slowing global demand

                In a briefing to reporters, she says that sustained domestic demand and spending are set to continue anchoring growth this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The growth was still above the long-term average of 5.1%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the quarter-on-quarter contraction in 4Q22, Nor Shamsiah says it was due to the exceptionally high growth in the previous third quarter.She points out that the contraction reflects “temporary slowdown” in Malaysia’s growth momentum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In terms of the drivers of growth private consumption fell 2.9%, investment was flat at only 0.3% growth and government expenditure fell by 5.4% as the pre-election boom ended,” he says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Nor Shamsiah foresees domestic demand to remain as key driver of growth, amid the slowing global demand

                About Us Advertise JOHOR BARU, Feb 11 — After a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19, the Chingay Parade Festival returned with a grand celebration which saw a crowd of over 300,000 thronging along Jalan Wong Ah Fook and around the city here, tonight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The procession of over 80 decorated vehicles which covered a distance of about 7.8 kilometres, began at the Xing Gong Temple in Jalan Ulu Air Molek, passed through Jalan Yahya Awal, Jalan Ibrahim, Jalan Wong Ah Fook, Jalan Gereja, Jalan Ngee Heng, Jalan Tun Abdul Razak, finally ended back at Xing Gong Temple, here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A visitor from Kuala Lumpur, Yang Chun Hou, 29 said he was thrilled to watch the parade as this was his first time at the festival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Hezrina Hedzer, 53, said the last time she attended the parade festival was in 2020 but it was a small celebration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, the Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar arrived to officiate 2023 Chingay Parade festival by beating the drums on the main stage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The last time the festival was held was in 2020 and it was organised on a small scale with only five decorated vehicles in the procession, to curb the spread of Covid-19

                About Us Advertise JOHOR BARU, Feb 11 — After a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19, the Chingay Parade Festival returned with a grand celebration which saw a crowd of over 300,000 thronging along Jalan Wong Ah Fook and around the city here, tonight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The procession of over 80 decorated vehicles which covered a distance of about 7.8 kilometres, began at the Xing Gong Temple in Jalan Ulu Air Molek, passed through Jalan Yahya Awal, Jalan Ibrahim, Jalan Wong Ah Fook, Jalan Gereja, Jalan Ngee Heng, Jalan Tun Abdul Razak, finally ended back at Xing Gong Temple, here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A visitor from Kuala Lumpur, Yang Chun Hou, 29 said he was thrilled to watch the parade as this was his first time at the festival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Hezrina Hedzer, 53, said the last time she attended the parade festival was in 2020 but it was a small celebration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, the Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar arrived to officiate 2023 Chingay Parade festival by beating the drums on the main stage

            <p>
                The last time the festival was held was in 2020 and it was organised on a small scale with only five decorated vehicles in the procession, to curb the spread of Covid-19

                Member of Parliament Tin Pei Ling will not be involved in public affairs and policy work in Singapore in her new role
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tin Pei Ling from the ruling People’s Action party had previously said that she can keep her two roles separate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PAP said in a Facebook post that it didn’t initially object when Tin informed the party that she would take up the role at the local ride-hailing and food delivery giant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "While she would make it clear that she was engaging in her private capacity and not as a PAP MP, there could still be challenges in carrying out these responsibilities, especially under the current circumstances.” Tin has since discussed the matter with Grab and informed the PAP that her role at the company has been changed to a director of corporate development, a position in which her primary duties won’t involve government relations in Singapore

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PAP said in its post that most party backbench MPs have private careers

                Anwar said that he was aware that there were a few 'wealthy people' protesting the decision with various threats, but the firm decision taken by the government showed a positive sign in the aspect of hiring foreign workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister said that without illegal money payments and oppressive corrupt practices, the government's comprehensive measures saw almost 200,000 foreign workers enter and register as workers in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Wednesday, Anwar said the government wants the Home Ministry to stop using agents for the recruitment of foreign workers, due to the high costs involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that, for example, the cost for a worker from Nepal is only RM3,700, but for those from Bangladesh and Indonesia, each worker involves a cost between RM20,000 and RM25,000, due to the high fees charged by agents, and described it as ‘modern slavery’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regarding the introduction of SKSSR, Anwar said that the scheme, which was introduced on Dec 1 last year, was a government effort, through the Social Security Organisation (Socso), in recognising the important role played by housewives

                The prime minister said that without illegal money payments and oppressive corrupt practices, the government's comprehensive measures saw almost 200,000 foreign workers enter and register as workers in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Wednesday, Anwar said the government wants the Home Ministry to stop using agents for the recruitment of foreign workers, due to the high costs involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that, for example, the cost for a worker from Nepal is only RM3,700, but for those from Bangladesh and Indonesia, each worker involves a cost between RM20,000 and RM25,000, due to the high fees charged by agents, and described it as ‘modern slavery’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regarding the introduction of SKSSR, Anwar said that the scheme, which was introduced on Dec 1 last year, was a government effort, through the Social Security Organisation (Socso), in recognising the important role played by housewives

                Malaysia’s economy recorded an encouraging performance with the GDP for 2022 recording 8.7 per cent, exceeding the estimate of 6.5 per cent - 7.0 per cent made in October 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Anwar, the achievement of 8.7 per cent growth for 2022 is supported by a strong economic performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 which, among other things, saw the recovery of private spending and investment, a decrease in unemployment and the strengthening of the ringgit

            <p>
                The country's GDP growth is however expected to moderate in 2023, in line with the latest global economic outlook by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank which estimates world economic growth to decrease from 3.4 per cent in 2022 to 2.9 per cent in 2023

                JAMIE CARRAGHER has admitted he is worried about Manchester United's revival under Erik ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And with Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer], no one ever thought he would be a manager who could win United a title
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also, it feels like there’s a spirit at United that we haven’t seen for a while
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think there’s something happening at Manchester United that I didn’t see with those other managers

                This is a young man who, at the same time last year, was still playing in the youth team and dreaming of a debut, now he is a fully-fledged first-teamer still learning his craft in the professional game

                Garnacho is a player with immense potential, but it is only that

            <p>
                If he fails to kick on, he could still be a top player, but if nurtured correctly and given time to develop, he could become one of the very best in the world

                Ayer Keroh Sessions judge Darmafikri Abu Adam ordered PS Tamil Kumaran, 36, to serve his prison sentence at Sungai Buloh Prison because he had a pending murder trial at the Shah Alam High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In imposing the sentence on Friday (Feb 10), the judge ordered the prison term to begin from the date of Tamil Kumaran's arrest on Oct 24, 2019

            <p>
                Tamil Kumaran, who was charged with two others, admitted to unlawful possession of a hand grenade in a car at the traffic light junction of the Alor Gajah-Melaka-Jasin Highway in Serkam here at about 12.15 pm on that day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The charge was framed under Section 8 of the Explosives Act 1957 and read together with Section 34 of the Penal Code
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tamil Kumaran was sentenced to five years' jail on each count, and a stroke of the cane for the second charge

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 10 — Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli today agreed that the country needs to create high and equal salaries while lowering costs of living by implementing programmes such as Menu Rahmah

                He added that the country is seeking to become a high-income nation in the next few years by crossing the gross national income (GNI) threshold of USD 15,205 (RM57,050) while seeking to have a more equal income distribution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since achieving the middle-income nation status in 1985, Malaysia’s economic growth has lagged behind other nations and fallen into the “middle-income trap”, a notion used to describe countries that are unable to catch up with higher-income nations

                “What we want to make sure is we don’t hit the status by per capita instead ensure the inequality gap is taken care of,” he said, adding that the government is looking into policy to calibrate equal wage growth among different income groups

                He added that as for other vehicles, including those owned by private firms, foreigners and the public service, they are still required to display their road tax information

                He added that drivers who are not ready to transition to the app, such as those without smartphones, can still choose to keep their road tax information sticker displayed on their vehicles during the “interim period”, which is expected to last for at least a year

                Mr Loke also said that vehicle owners can keep a screenshot of their e-licence to be shown to the authorities if they happen to be in an area without an Internet connection.  On expanding the regulation to also cover other road users, he said that his ministry will first consider the system’s preparedness and public reception.  The move was announced as part of Malaysia’s digitalisation efforts by the transport ministry as well as the Road Transport Department (JPJ)

                When asked what measures the government had in mind as alternatives, Rafizi said he is unable to answer at the moment, but noted that the administration’s plans to implement targeted subsidies will aid in alleviating the cost of living burden on the vulnerable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The process to make that decision is under way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi claimed the implementation of targeted subsidies is a “big challenge”, and that is why prior administrations did not attempt to implement it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think the government will go through this process and balance the implementation, which will be released in stages,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the government plans to subsidise the cost of goods for the vulnerable, he highlighted that it must also ensure that wage growth among the various economic strata is balanced.  He shared that the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) had zoned in on wage growth as one of the focuses of the 12th Malaysia Plan’s (12MP) mid-term review
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But what we want to make sure of as well is that we don’t hit the high-income nation status by per capita while inequality is still big,” he stressed.  Last December, Rafizi said the EPU is expected to table the 12MP's mid-term review in September this year

                Incidentally, despite offering up to a full terabyte of mobile data for users in their new postpaid lineup, it still came with a 5GB hotspot quota, with hotspot boosters required if you exceeded it

            <p>
                That means that from now onwards, whenever a U Postpaid subscriber uses hotspot, they will be using their main data quota rather than a separate hotspot data quota

                For example, if you’re using U Postpaid 68 with 100GB of data a month, you can use up to 100GB of 5G hotspot a month rather than just 5GB

                The telco is also doubling the monthly quota for its U Postpaid 38 plan from its original 30GB to 60GB of up to 5G data a month

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 10 — Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) today announced that Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.7 per cent last year, and gave assurance that Malaysia’s economy will not be going into a recession this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a press conference, BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus pointed out that last year’s growth rate is the highest annual growth rate posted by the country in the past 22 years — after the 8.9 per cent growth rate recorded in 2000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was also announced that the GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2022 (Q4 2022) moderated to 7.0 per cent — following the 14.2 per cent growth registered in Q3 2022 — due to waning support from stimulus measures and low base effects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, net exports contracted by 1.8 per cent, albeit showing improvement compared to the 4.1 per contraction in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Headline inflation for the year stood at 3.3 per cent while core inflation was at three per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uzir added that 2022’s GDP amounted to RM1.8 trillion at current prices, and RM1.5 trillion at constant prices — leaving the gross national income per capita to surge to RM52,819 from the RM46,163 recorded the previous year.

                Mark Ogden explains the latest updates around the potential sale of Manchester United by the Glazer family

            <p>
                Raine Group, the New York-based investment bank, are overseeing the process to either sell the club or attract substantial new investment and a soft deadline of Feb
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Separate sources familiar with the bidding process have told ESPN that at least two groups with an interest in an involvement in United are sceptical that the Glazers are looking to sell all of their stake in the club, which they bought in 2005 following a leveraged takeover
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Multiple sources told ESPN that Joel and Avram Glazer, the United co-chairmen, have not ruled out the prospect of attracting a wealthy investor to help fund the club's plans to upgrade Old Trafford and United's Carrington training ground
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But with four of the Glazer siblings having already reduced their shareholding in recent months, sources have said that Joel and Avram accept that they cannot hold onto United unless they find outside investment through the sale process
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise LONDON, Feb 10 — Manchester United have reportedly opened talks with Qatari investors as speculation intensifies over the future ownership of the Premier League giants ahead of a deadline for bids
            </p>

                The Daily Mail said a group of private investors from Qatar want to buy United and talks have taken place with the club’s hierarchy, confident that theirs would be the strongest bid

                Fred appeals to referee Simon Hooper during Wednesday night's 2-2 draw with Leeds United It was a disappointing night for United as they had to fight back from two goals down to draw Having been hooked at half-time in that disastrous 4-0 defeat by Brentford back in August, Fred has started just five Premier League games since, with United more and more comfortable with Casemiro and Eriksen as the midfield pair

                Manchester United starlet Kobbie Mainoo has signed a new four-year contract at the club Mainoo poses with United's head of academy Nick Cox (left) and manager Erik ten Hag (right) Handed his first team debut against Charlton Athletic in the Carabao Cup quarter final win last month, many staff thought the 17-year-old was 'unlucky' not to have been given his bow before then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As well as impressing Ten Hag in training, he was recognised as man of the match in a behind closed doors friendly with Everton during the World Cup and scored against Cadiz during United's warm weather training camp in December.  After making his debut in the Carabao Cup, Ten Hag said the teenager had impressed in United's winter training camp during the World Cup break, which led to him being given the opportunity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'The most important thing is to win this game and get into the next round,' Ten Hag told MUTV.  Mainoo (centre) was handed his senior Manchester United debut against Charlton last month 'We want to get into the semi-finals, so it's a big game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So I felt at home.  Ten Hag is a big fan of Mainoo and the club have now handed him a long-term deal The 17-year-old was handed the start after impressing Ten Hag during training over the winter 'To be able to follow Casemiro closely and watch him in training is an honour and for him to come on for me is crazy

                The 17-year-old midfielder, one of eight United academy prospects to appear for the first team this season, made his full debut in last month's Carabao Cup win against Charlton

                Sportsmail understands Mainoo has signed a four-year contract with the option to extend it by a further year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United starlet Kobbie Mainoo has signed a new four-year contract at the club Mainoo poses with United's head of academy Nick Cox (left) and manager Erik ten Hag (right) Handed his first team debut against Charlton Athletic in the Carabao Cup quarter final win last month, many staff thought the 17-year-old was 'unlucky' not to have been given his bow before then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As well as impressing Ten Hag in training, he was recognised as man of the match in a behind closed doors friendly with Everton during the World Cup and scored against Cadiz during United's warm weather training camp in December.  After making his debut in the Carabao Cup, Ten Hag said the teenager had impressed in United's winter training camp during the World Cup break, which led to him being given the opportunity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'The most important thing is to win this game and get into the next round,' Ten Hag told MUTV.  Mainoo (centre) was handed his senior Manchester United debut against Charlton last month 'We want to get into the semi-finals, so it's a big game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So I felt at home.  Ten Hag is a big fan of Mainoo and the club have now handed him a long-term deal The 17-year-old was handed the start after impressing Ten Hag during training over the winter 'To be able to follow Casemiro closely and watch him in training is an honour and for him to come on for me is crazy

                The short-covering rally appears to have been set in motion by Tesla's recent price cuts

                Detailed images taken by high-altitude U2s showed the balloon’s equipment “was clearly for intelligence surveillance and inconsistent with the equipment onboard weather balloons,” the senior State Department official said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The official indicated that the US believes the balloon was under the control of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, and is part of a fleet of balloons that China has sent over more than 40 countries on five continents to collect intelligence information
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are confident that the balloon manufacturer has a direct relationship with China’s military, “ the official said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The official said the US was weighing taking action against Chinese entities linked to the balloon’s operation, which suggests it might slap them with sanctions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier Thursday Beijing confirmed that it refused an overture on Saturday by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for phone discussions with Chinese counterparts over the balloon issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                US operations meanwhile continued to recover debris from the balloon just off the coast of the eastern state of South Carolina

                Detailed images taken by high-altitude U2s showed the balloon’s equipment “was clearly for intelligence surveillance and inconsistent with the equipment onboard weather balloons,” the senior State Department official said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The official indicated that the US believes the balloon was under the control of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, and is part of a fleet of balloons that China has sent over more than 40 countries on five continents to collect intelligence information
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are confident that the balloon manufacturer has a direct relationship with China’s military, “ the official said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The official said the US was weighing taking action against Chinese entities linked to the balloon’s operation, which suggests it might slap them with sanctions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier Thursday Beijing confirmed that it refused an overture on Saturday by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for phone discussions with Chinese counterparts over the balloon issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                US operations meanwhile continued to recover debris from the balloon just off the coast of the eastern state of South Carolina

                Ten Hag is not expecting either player back for the trip to Leeds on Sunday and they remain doubts for the Europa League clash with Barcelona at Camp Nou on Thursday

            <p>
                "I don't expect [to have Martial or Antony available against Leeds] but we have some days," Ten Hag said

            <p>
                "I can't say for 100% [they will miss Barcelona] but I don't expect [they will be back]

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 10 ― Datuk Misbun Sidek’s role has changed from Badminton Association of Malaysia’s (BAM) director of youth development to the director of youth singles coaching effective this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) executive director Michelle Chai said the change in position was part of a programme to reorganise the national youth squad's coaching line-up following the disappointing performance at the 2022 BWF World Junior Championships in Santander, Spain, last October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Michelle said ABM would also utilise the expertise of BAM doubles coaching director Rexy Mainaky who had been made the new youth doubles coaching director
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the first time ever, no national player qualified for the quarter-finals of the singles event at the world junior championships, and the national team only finished ninth in the mixed team event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was the second time in a row that Malaysia returned empty-handed after the 2019 edition in Kazan, Russia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our last mixed team event win was at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, so that has given us a motivational boost for the BAMTC,” he told reporters after the last day of the central training camp ahead of BAMTC here today

                Singapore’s tax system is progressive that way, in the sense that if you can earn and own more, then you should be able to pay more.” Personal income tax and corporate income tax are other forms of revenue that could be tapped to increase government revenue and keep pace with spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The timing to raise corporate tax and personal income tax will depend on market and business cycles, which is hard to predict,” said Mr Seah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One example is estate tax, which was abolished in 2008
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An estate tax imposes a tax on the market value of a person’s estate after they die
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Iras, collections from estate taxes made up only 1 per cent of total tax revenue, or S$153.7 million in 2007
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though raising corporate and personal income tax could make Singapore less attractive, Mr Song said that some may be willing to pay higher tax rates

                Singapore’s tax system is progressive that way, in the sense that if you can earn and own more, then you should be able to pay more.” Personal income tax and corporate income tax are other forms of revenue that could be tapped to increase government revenue and keep pace with spending
            </p>

                One example is estate tax, which was abolished in 2008
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Iras, collections from estate taxes made up only 1 per cent of total tax revenue, or S$153.7 million in 2007
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though raising corporate and personal income tax could make Singapore less attractive, Mr Song said that some may be willing to pay higher tax rates

Anwar has sounded a note of caution on the federal government’s debt and off-budget liabilities, which has now reached RM1.5 trillion or more than 80% of GDP

                Anwar’s lawyer Datuk Sankara Nair confirmed this, and said the apology was made in open court before Judge Noor Ruwena Md Nurdin on Thursday (Feb 9) and added that his client has accepted the apology
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his apology, Razman - who is the Gunung Semanggol assemblyman - said his remarks in one of his speeches during the 15th General Election campaign had offended and impinged directly on Anwar’s moral values and good reputation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Razman further said that he would never repeat the above remarks in any form or manner in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar had filed the lawsuit on Dec 5, naming Razman as the sole defendant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed the speech was broadcast live on Razman’s Facebook under the username "Haji Razman Zakaria" and was viewed more than 94,400 times, received over 5,100 reactions, 429 shares and over 2,600 comments up to today

                No complaints from Najib about bank statements Yu said that Low and Nik Faisal had asked that Najib's bank statements should not be sent to him even though AmBank had Najib's house address from his account opening form

            <p>
                She said she supported the idea for Najib to close his AmBank accounts and even suggested to Low that Najib should open accounts with other banks, but added that she did not go as far make the suggestion to Najib directly

                Akram pointed out that the physical transfer of cash deposits, over the counter into Najib's AmBank account, were a significantly large amount “Did the account holder, Datuk Seri Najib himself or any of his representatives, his mandate holder, or any of his officers from his office or personal officers enquire about the over the counter transactions?” he asked

                No complaints from Najib about bank statements Yu said that Low and Nik Faisal had asked that Najib's bank statements should not be sent to him even though AmBank had Najib's house address from his account opening form

                Last month, two Umno members lodged a report with the RoS seeking an investigation into a possible breach of the party’s constitution

            <p>
                Last month, two Umno members lodged a report with the RoS seeking an investigation into a possible breach of the party’s constitution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They claimed the tabling of the motion at the Umno general assembly had breached Article 10 of the party’s constitution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Ahmad Zahid also confirmed that the party has yet to receive any appeal from sacked members during the party’s purge last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among those sacked are former Umno Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar, former Selangor Umno chief Tan Sri Noh Omar and former Umno Youth exco Datuk Tun Faisal Ismail Aziz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In another matter, Ahmad Zahid downplayed former prime minister and Umno vice president Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s claim that he was sidelined after the party's defeat in the 15th general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said it is normal for Ismail to have the opinion that his government is the best

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Feb 9 — The Malaysian government announced today it has agreed in principle to a new Operating Agreement (OA 2023) between Malaysia Airport Holdings Berhad (MAHB), including establishing a new development trust account solely for airport development through contributions from airport users themselves
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dubbed the Airport Development Fund (ADF) and a game-changer, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said contributions from airport users such as the public and airline operators will be channelled to the new trust account under OA 2023

                Loke explained that MAHB was only in charge of managing airports under the existing MAHB agreement and any form of airport development cost funding must be sourced from government allocations under its annual development expenditures, thus putting a strain on government coffers

                About Us Advertise BESTARI JAYA, Feb 9 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today that his administration does not intend to encourage the public to withdraw any more money from their retirement savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In the past we asked to be allowed to withdraw some money from their EPF savings but what if they now only have RM10,000 or RM5,000 left? “Still want to withdraw? What happens in three to five years when they retire, reach pension age? I know it's their money but if you take all the money out then what about the kids and your future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite that, Ismail Sabri had been asking the public to make their voices heard if they want to withdraw their EPF money as he too faced this dilemma when he was prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Anwar said the focus for his revised Budget 2023 on February 24 will be to alleviate the public's burden regarding the high cost of living
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Budget 2023 scheduled to be presented again in Parliament on February 24 will not be tied to the budget presented by the previous government in October 2022

                The Finance Ministry also launched the Budget 2023 Proposal Portal to make the annual budget preparation process more transparent and inclusive which welcomes the involvement of all levels of the people.

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Feb 9 — Vaccination will continue to be offered for free and remain the first line of defence against Covid-19 as Singapore scales back on its infection control measures, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday (Feb 9)

                As it was previously, the Hotlink Postpaid 40 plan actually only gave users 12GB of data a month, with an extra 8GB per month for the first 12 months to prop the first year’s monthly data rate to 20GB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ditto the Hotlink Postpaid 60 plan, which really just provides 30GB a month with the first 12 months getting a bonus of 10GB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once this comes into effect, the 30GB and 50GB data allocation that subscribers get is the real quota that will be available throughout their subscription period

                Chong has deemed it unnecessary for MPP to have a new building, saying the money should be better allocated to improve the services and infrastructure in areas under the council’s jurisdiction 
            </p>

            <p>
                Chong said the construction of a new building involved a huge sum of RM60 million, and the public has the right to voice their concerns regarding the project

                The video-streaming giant, which has estimated that 100 million around the world use a shared account, said that members can now easily manage who has access to their account, transfer profile to a new account and still easily watch Netflix on their personal devices or log into a new TV

            <p>
                The High Court, however, ruled against Aminah in respect of the other two company shares
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Court of Appeal, on August 19, last year, dismissed both the appeals by the children and Aminah and upheld the High Court’s decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ikhwan Hafiz and Nur Anis subsequently filed leave to appeal to the Federal Court against the court decisions on the Rantai Wawasan shares
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah, however, did not file leave to appeal against the court decisions relating to the Alpine Motion and Ivory Insights shares

                Budget 2023 will be tabled on Feb 24

            <p>
                Earlier, when addressing the Finance Ministry’s monthly gathering, Anwar said radical measures to recharge the economy would be among the highlights of the Budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More importantly, he said, the people would benefit from what the government has in store
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also noted that Malaysia was still behind in the implementation of economic policies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said one of the main challenges in drawing up Budget 2023 was to balance policies that would attract investors and ensure the welfare and well-being of the people, particularly the poor

                But lately, Burry’s been doing a lot of musing

            <p>
                “This time is different,” he wrote in a cryptic tweet on Tuesday that included a chart showing the roughly 40% stock market drop—and multiple bear market rallies—that occurred during the dot-com bubble of early 2000s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Burry also plotted the steep decline in the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate during the dot-com era, hinting at the stark contrast between the Fed’s current rate trajectory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the chart Burry shared from 2000 and 2001, the S&P 500 experienced a strong bear market rally after the Fed cut rates in September of 2001, leading some investors to believe stocks were set to soar
            </p>

                Burry’s tweet seems to be hinting that enthusiasm that the stock market will continue on an upward trajectory is misplaced, and that history is repeating itself here

                International prosecutors said on Wednesday they had found "strong indications" that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the use in Ukraine of a Russian missile system that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over eastern Ukraine in 2014

                Arsenal claimed their spot in the Continental Cup final thanks to a Stina Blackstenius goal three minutes into extra time to secure a 1-0 victory over Manchester City
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The two former league cup winners were level after 90 minutes, just as were the last time they met in a league cup final in 2019 but unlike that day Blackstenius' strike prevented the need for a penalty shootout

                The Swedish attacker was involved again for Arsenal as she first drew a low save from Sandy MacIver before sending her flicked header just wide

            <p>
                Knocking but unable to open the door over the 90 minutes, Arsenal finally broke the deadlock at the start of extra time when Blackstenius sent Hurtig's square ball beyond MacIver
            </p>
            
            <p>
                City increased the pressure over the second half of extra time, forcing the hosts back and coming agonisingly close in the last knockings when Hayley Raso met a ball at the back post only for D'Angelo to claim

            <p>

            <p>
                United's own title bid took a major hit on Wednesday against Leeds after they could also only grab a point but Rashford's goal started a comeback, with Erik ten Hag's side 2-0 down following a first minute strike from Wilfried Gnonto and an own goal just after half-time from Raphael Varane

                Marcus Rashford heads home for Manchester United during their 2-2 draw with Leeds United His sixth Premier League goal at Old Trafford in a row helped United recover from 2-0 down Rooney's six-match run of home Premier League goals was set in a 4-4 draw with Everton Rashford rose highest to meet a Diogo Dalot cross to head home just after the hour mark before Jadon Sancho equalised with 20 minutes remaining
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The goal also marked Rashford's 20th of the season across all competitions - including 11 from 22 top flight games The 25-year-old's six-match scoring run started against West Ham back in October and since then he has found the net against Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Manchester City and also Crystal Palace.  It's not just at home where Rasfhord has impressed

            <p>
                Since the return of domestic action following the World Cup finals in December he has scored in all but one of United's eight Premier League games.  Meanwhile, United boss Erik ten Hag has praised Sancho for netting their equaliser against Leeds, capping a return to form for the forward who has spent much of the winter on regaining his mental and physical match fitness having been out since October

                United's own title bid took a major hit on Wednesday against Leeds after they could also only grab a point but Rashford's goal started a comeback, with Erik ten Hag's side 2-0 down following a first minute strike from Wilfried Gnonto and an own goal just after half-time from Raphael Varane

                Marcus Rashford heads home for Manchester United during their 2-2 draw with Leeds United His sixth Premier League goal at Old Trafford in a row helped United recover from 2-0 down Rooney's six-match run of home Premier League goals was set in a 4-4 draw with Everton Rashford rose highest to meet a Diogo Dalot cross to head home just after the hour mark before Jadon Sancho equalised with 20 minutes remaining
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The goal also marked Rashford's 20th of the season across all competitions - including 11 from 22 top flight games The 25-year-old's six-match scoring run started against West Ham back in October and since then he has found the net against Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Manchester City and also Crystal Palace.  It's not just at home where Rasfhord has impressed

            <p>
                Since the return of domestic action following the World Cup finals in December he has scored in all but one of United's eight Premier League games.  Meanwhile, United boss Erik ten Hag has praised Sancho for netting their equaliser against Leeds, capping a return to form for the forward who has spent much of the winter on regaining his mental and physical match fitness having been out since October

                "We hope Australia will provide a fair, just and nondiscriminatory environment for the normal operations of Chinese enterprises," foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Thursday (Feb 9), accusing Canberra of "misusing national might to discriminate against and suppress Chinese enterprises"

                "The Chinese government has always encouraged Chinese enterprises to conduct overseas investment and cooperation in accordance with market principles and international rules, on the basis of respecting local laws," Mao said, adding Beijing opposed any action "stretching the concept of national security".

            <p>
                Previously, non-fully vaccinated visitors were required to test negative for Covid within 2 days prior to their departure for Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Most of those infected in Singapore have had mild or no symptoms
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Singapore will further downgrade its disease outbreak response, bringing it back to pre-pandemic levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, Singapore's Multi-Ministry Taskforce — formed in January 2020 in response to Covid-19 — will also stand down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the height of the pandemic, Singapore raised the level to orange

                This is the second showing for the Axia in the ASEAN NCAP test, following the earlier result in 2014 when the outgoing generation first arrived on the scene, when it achieved a four-star rating in both adult occupant protection (AOP) and child occupant protection (COP) categories
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2023 Axia scored 25.65 points from a possible 32 points for adult occupant protection (AOP), 43.43 points from a possible 51 points for child occupant protection (COP), 16.50 points from a possible 21 points for safety assist and 7.00 points from a possible 16 points for motorcyclist safety
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its AOP score was comprised of 14.96 in the frontal impact test, 6.69 points in the side impact test, and 4.00 points for head protection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the COP score consisted of 24.00 points in the dynamic test, 9.00 points in the vehicle-based test, 10.43 points for the installation test and zero for child detection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For motorcyclist safety, this was comprised of 4.00 for blind spot detection, zero for rear visualisation, 1.00 for headlight, 2.00 for pedestrian and zero for the advanced MST test
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All in, the 2023 Perodua Axia achieved weighted scores of 32.06 in AOP, 17.03 in COP, 15.71 in safety assist and 8.75 in motorcyclist safety – five stars in all categories bar motorcyclist safety, which saw four – for a total weighted score of 73.55 points, which brings the upcoming Perodua model a four-star ASEAN NCAP rating

                In a statement today, president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai said the government could implement a phased and gradual increase in the electricity tariff surcharge as an alternative policy to allow industries and businesses to adjust and plan their operations and investments

            <p>
                He said that other measures would include developing alternative energy sources and solutions, such as renewable energy and energy storage, to reduce overall energy costs for industries and businesses

                No complaints from Najib Throughout the years when she was acting as the AmBank relationship manager for Najib’s private accounts, Yu confirmed she had never received any complaints from Najib himself or his mandate holder Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil that his five accounts were not being operated according to the mandate

Based on the mandate letters, Yu confirmed that it would not have been possible for Nik Faisal or Low Taek Jho to issue or sign cheques on behalf of Najib, as Najib would have to sign the cheques himself
            </p>

            <p>
                She claimed the insects spread to her other wood furniture at home, and that she called Ikea three times about the incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spokesman noted that the customer contacted Ikea on Jan 30 and the company resolved the incident with her on Tuesday

                North Korea appears to be staging its first military parade in almost a year, providing leader Kim Jong-un a platform to show off his latest weapons after threatening to exponentially expand his nuclear arms programmes

                But Yu disagreed with such accusations, stressing that her meetings at Low’s apartment in the past were purely for work reasons and that there were always other individuals present

                The BBM conversation on August 21, 2014 had begun at 12.41am with Low’s message regarding the notification about the expected RM5 million cheque to Umno from Najib’s account and with Yu replying at around 1.06am, with Low’s next replies coming in at 5.32am and close to 7.30am, and Yu’s replies coming in subsequently

                Shafee also attempted to suggest that Yu was being inappropriate as a banker due to her visits to Low’s apartments in the past, claiming that she had gone there sometimes in the late hours of the evening
            </p>

            <p>
                The BBM conversation on August 21, 2014 had begun at 12.41am with Low’s message regarding the notification about the expected RM5 million cheque to Umno from Najib’s account and with Yu replying at around 1.06am, with Low’s next replies coming in at 5.32am and close to 7.30am, and Yu’s replies coming in subsequently

                Shafee also attempted to suggest that Yu was being inappropriate as a banker due to her visits to Low’s apartments in the past, claiming that she had gone there sometimes in the late hours of the evening

                Having kept their 2023 MotoGP aerodynamics under wraps for as long as possible, the latest downforce developments began to emerge during the Sepang Shakedown Test
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The following pictures, supplied by the Sepang Circuit, show some of fairings seen on track by Yamaha, Aprilia, Ducati, KTM and Honda

            <p>
                Crutchlow finished the test second overall behind Pirro and spent much of the final day using the latest 'stealth' aero (without a number on it)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                KTM added some intrigue by turning off the transponder on lead test rider Dani Pedrosa's bikes, but the Spaniard was seen using both a full Red Bull liveried 2022 fairing and then the following prototype, which looked to be a tweaked version of a new fairing at the Valencia test
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Due to rain delays on Days 1 and 2, more innovations could hit the track at the official test

            <p>
                Honda's test rider Stefan Bradl appeared to have the least aero changes, relative to Valencia test, where they had already used the Ducati-style lower ducts and rear seat wings

                The West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), the military wing of Papua's main separatist group, claimed Tuesday's attack on a Susi Air plane in Nduga district -- an area where rebels have launched several attacks on authorities and civilians in recent years

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Gary Neville believes Chelsea overspent for Enzo Fernandez and Marc Cucurella and has questioned Todd Boehly’s ‘strange’ approach in the transfer market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea news, exclusives and analysis American businessman Boehly has spent almost £600m on new signings since buying Chelsea from Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea spent £64m to sign Cucurella from Brighton last summer, while they made Fernandez the most expensive signing in Premier League history in a £107m deal from Benfica in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘It felt like that at Chelsea in the summer and it was chaotic

            <p>
                ‘Spending this money hasn’t made Chelsea better yet, just look at where they are in the league,’ Carragher said

                Chelsea spent £64m to sign Cucurella from Brighton last summer, while they made Fernandez the most expensive signing in Premier League history in a £107m deal from Benfica in January

                Liverpool is preparing to lose Naby Keïta on a free in the summer and that means Jürgen Klopp needs to enter the transfer market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our newsletter subscribers get a rundown Monday to Friday from one of the best Liverpool FC writers — straight to your inbox, and completely for free
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! As The Telegraph reported last month, Liverpool remains keen on Wolves midfielder Matheus Nunes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like Keïta, Nunes is a different type of midfielder from what you might typically associate with Jürgen Klopp, but his ability to keep possession under pressure and decisively move it forward is exactly what Liverpool is currently missing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Keïta has missed 86 matches since the start of the 2018 season when he came to Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, if Nunes does arrive at Liverpool in the summer, Keïta will be adequately replaced in terms of quality and style, and considerably upgraded in terms of availability

                Liverpool is preparing to lose Naby Keïta on a free in the summer and that means Jürgen Klopp needs to enter the transfer market
            </p>

            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! As The Telegraph reported last month, Liverpool remains keen on Wolves midfielder Matheus Nunes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like Keïta, Nunes is a different type of midfielder from what you might typically associate with Jürgen Klopp, but his ability to keep possession under pressure and decisively move it forward is exactly what Liverpool is currently missing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Keïta has missed 86 matches since the start of the 2018 season when he came to Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, if Nunes does arrive at Liverpool in the summer, Keïta will be adequately replaced in terms of quality and style, and considerably upgraded in terms of availability
            </p>

                Manchester United are preparing for a Qatar-based bid to rid the Red Devils of their controversial Glazer ownership Manchester United is to be the subject of a Qatar-based ownership bid within the coming days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's according to the Mail (opens in new tab), who says that United could be the next Premier League club to be taken over by Middle Eastern buyers, following Manchester City and Newcastle United, owned by UAE and Saudi Arabian groups, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There could be plans, too, to give Erik ten Hag a huge transfer budget to reshape the Red Devils as he sees fit.   According to the report, "high-wealth individuals based in the oil-rich state, buoyed by Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup, have set their sights on a club they view as ‘football’s crown jewels’." United are one of the highest-profile clubs in the world, of course, and the most successful Premier League side ever with 13 titles in the modern era.  Qatar's monarch Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani is apparently a big United fan – and with current owners, the Glazer family, setting a deadline for bids somewhere in the middle of February, there is hope that a bid for the club could be made swiftly.  The report states, too, that the investors interested in purchasing Manchester United are a different group from those who own Paris Saint-German, Qatari Sports Investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Along with a Qatari-based bid, United are expecting interest from Sir Jim Ratcliffe (opens in new tab), owner of Ligue 1 side Nice and long-standing United supporter.  UFC star Conor McGregor has also touted potentially buying (opens in new tab) the Old Trafford outfit.  Formal bids are set to be submitted to buy United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The club had a quiet January window but brought in Marcel Sabitzer on deadline day after Christian Eriksen picked up a long-term injury
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former United chairman Martin Edwards, meanwhile, has spoken to FFT about how the club's 1991 European Cup Winners' Cup victory helped changed the perception of English football across the continent

            <p>
                Don't use my name to attack Cristiano
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cristiano was part of our team for half the season and as I said in many interviews, everyone since Liverpool is being amazing and acting like a proper team and you can see the results

                The fact that one of the greatest players of all time in Bayern Munich and Germany legend Lothar Matthaus rates Randal Kolo Muani as highly as he does should music to the ears of every Liverpool fan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 24-year-old has reportedly been valued at a steep £88 million price tag, who has been speculated with a move to Manchester United which would make him the club’s record signing, even surpassing the £85 million fee the club paid to sign Darwin Nunez from Benfica
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thankfully for Liverpool, they can sleep well knowing that if they shell out such a sizable fee for the ‘robust’ Randal Kolo Muani, it may well be worth it as Lothar Mathaus has given him a major stamp of approval

            <p>
                Looking at the sorry state of affairs at Anfield, how can one expect the player to pick them of all destinations? Liverpool are languishing in 10th place in the Premier League table, having not won a single game in 2023 and with there being no clarity over their penny-pinching owners leaving, which would leave Randal Kolo Muani no choice but to go elsewhere, with a club bringing in a potential legend in the making, as per Lothar Matthaus at least

                About Us Advertise   TENOM, Feb 7 — A prosecution witness in the trial of preacher Ebit Irawan Ibrahim Lew, or Ebit Lew, told the Magistrate’s Court here today that she had confiscated a mobile phone belonging to preacher Firdaus Wong Wai Hung

            <p>
                Police officer Supt Hirdawati Isa, 42, said the phone was seized at 7.05pm on September 28, 2021

            <p>
                The sixth prosecution witness said she was instructed by investigating officer Supt Noor Asyikin Shamsuri to seize the phone when Wong came to Bukit Aman that day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On that day (September 28, 2021), Wong came to the D11 office at Bukit Aman, I introduced myself as a policewoman and asked Wong to hand over his identity card

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Manchester United are yet to make a decision over their priority transfer target this summer with Erik ten Hag set to choose between Harry Kane or Victor Osimhen, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Telegraph reports that Kane and Osimhen are the two players who currently top United’s shortlist, while Ten Hag is still determining which striker would work best in his system at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report claims that Ten Hag has been keeping tabs on Osimhen’s performances for Napoli since the start of the season but is ‘unsure’ over some parts of the 24-year-old’s game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, it’s claimed that Ten Hag understands that Kane offers a ‘unique skillset’ and would be a ‘strong character’ at United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, both Kane and Osimhen are likely to cost United at least £100 million this summer but the Nigeria international would offer Ten Hag a longer-term solution if he proves to be a success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Napoli would also command in excess of £100m for Osimhen, who is the top scorer in Serie A this season with 16 goals for Napoli

                Things do not look like they are going to get any easier for Liverpool, either
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One pundit has even suggested the manager could join one of Liverpool’s biggest Premier League rivals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Liverpool’s defence has been incredibly leaky this term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They can’t rely on Matip and Gomez to cover
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So if Real do not come calling, then a move to Liverpool could become his next priority
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They have named 10 players who could be let go by Liverpool this summer as part of a big rebuild.
