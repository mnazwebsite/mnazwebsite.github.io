                For 2022, the average retiree Social Security is $1,657 per month

            <p>
                Therefore, with a $300,000 retirement account, the odds are you will need to wait until full retirement age before collecting Social Security benefits

                Collecting Social Security early reduces your benefits for each month you start before full retirement age

                For 2022, the average retiree Social Security is $1,657 per month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Let’s assume there are no income sources besides this $300,000 retirement account and average Social Security benefits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, with a $300,000 retirement account, the odds are you will need to wait until full retirement age before collecting Social Security benefits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Collecting Social Security early reduces your benefits for each month you start before full retirement age

                But there is a market we should be worrying about far more – the American one

            <p>
                If the US market crashes, it will tip the economy into recession, and that will ripple out across the world

            <p>

                In reality, the solvency of the American financial system remains critically dependent on the health of the housing market

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 27 — Treasury secretary-general Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican has said that the government did not want to increase income tax rates for those with annual earnings above RM1 million, as it felt that the top tax rate of 30 per cent was already “sufficiently high”

                About Us Advertise   PUTRAJAYA, Feb 27 — Datuk Seri Najib Razak derailed the entirety of his final appeal at the Federal Court over his SRC International conviction and sentencing last year when he changed his legal counsel at the eleventh hour, prosecutors said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Telling the Federal Court during the former prime minister’s bid to have the apex court’s decision reviewed, ad hoc prosecutor Datuk V Sithambaram said Najib’s bid to change ‘horses’ so close to the scheduled hearing dates was a ‘strategy gone wrong’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sithambaram’s remark echoed his previous argument that Najib was the author of his misfortune and consequently cannot invoke the Federal Court’s inherent jurisdiction to review its own decision in his final appeal hearing last August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, ZIST opted to discharge themselves, leaving Hisyam as the remaining sole counsel in Najib’s defence whose request for dischargement was however denied by the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A five-member panel presided over today’s hearing with Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Datuk Abdul Rahman Sebli leading Federal Court judges Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, Datuk Nordin Hassan and Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abu Bakar Jais on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Nazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal judge, had sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined him RM210 million in default five years imprisonment and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on December 8, 2021.

                The Prime Minister also expressed hope that Malaysia could organise a conference in the future that involved experts that represent Islam, and other religions that exist in Malaysia as well as the west to have a better understanding of the issue through a discourse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said that while Islamophobia is very much real and more needs to be done to address the issue, the Muslim world also needs to overcome its prejudice and continuously engage with the west
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Malaysia, the Prime Minister said although the country does not face the issue of terrorist cells, thanks to the continuous hard work of the security forces, it needs to be wary of the issue of purveyors of violence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Otherwise, Islamophobics will take over the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The purveyors of violence are also an issue that we have to be on guard otherwise it will be too late,” he said
            </p>

                The Prime Minister also expressed hope that Malaysia could organise a conference in the future that involved experts that represent Islam, and other religions that exist in Malaysia as well as the west to have a better understanding of the issue through a discourse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said that while Islamophobia is very much real and more needs to be done to address the issue, the Muslim world also needs to overcome its prejudice and continuously engage with the west
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Malaysia, the Prime Minister said although the country does not face the issue of terrorist cells, thanks to the continuous hard work of the security forces, it needs to be wary of the issue of purveyors of violence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Otherwise, Islamophobics will take over the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The purveyors of violence are also an issue that we have to be on guard otherwise it will be too late,” he said

            <p>
                He said the Kedah Aerotropolis project will start with an integrated logistics hub which would not require an airport with passenger terminals and that such a facility will be developed if there is demand in the future, noting that the proposed Kulim international airport is just one of the project’s sub-component and will act as an enabler to the entire project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Kedah Aerotropolis project will seek to complement the Penang International Airport in terms of dealing with the projected increase in passengers especially from 2030 onwards

                Sanusi said Kedah has so far spent RM28 million for the Kedah Aerotropolis project such as for consultancy fees, marketing works, and project planning, and said the state government hopes a presentation for the project can be arranged soon to enable a detailed explanation to be given to Anwar for a more in-depth understanding of the project

            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a breakthrough for Letshanaa as she ended her five-year title drought with her first International Challenge title
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She last won a title at the lower-ranked Mauritius International in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I hope that this title will give me a boost to achieve more in the future.” Letshanaa will now shift her focus to the Thailand International Challenge from March 7-12 in Korat, where she will be playing against Indonesia’s Ruzana Ruzana in the qualifying round

                by Mark Worwood Shares Super Sunny Sing extended his winning run to four, advertised his Hong Kong Derby credentials and delivered the biggest victory of Chris So Wai-yin’s career when he won Sunday’s second leg of the four-year-old series, the Classic Cup (1,800m)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Super Sunny Sing, whom So did not even enter in the Classic Mile because his rating of 67 at the time of the Jockey Club framing its field was too low for him to get into the race, was the second leg of Vincent Ho Chak-yiu’s Sha Tin feature double following Golden Sixty’s Group One Gold Cup triumph
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What a day for @Vincenthocy!? 🙌 The Gold Cup and Classic Cup go home with the 32-year-old as Super Sunny Sing sweeps to victory for Chris So
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Now we’re aiming for the Derby, so we’ll have to get him to recover.” Also, Ho spoke about the stark difference between Super Sunny Sing now and just a few months ago

                by Mark Worwood Shares Super Sunny Sing extended his winning run to four, advertised his Hong Kong Derby credentials and delivered the biggest victory of Chris So Wai-yin’s career when he won Sunday’s second leg of the four-year-old series, the Classic Cup (1,800m)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Super Sunny Sing, whom So did not even enter in the Classic Mile because his rating of 67 at the time of the Jockey Club framing its field was too low for him to get into the race, was the second leg of Vincent Ho Chak-yiu’s Sha Tin feature double following Golden Sixty’s Group One Gold Cup triumph
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What a day for @Vincenthocy!? 🙌 The Gold Cup and Classic Cup go home with the 32-year-old as Super Sunny Sing sweeps to victory for Chris So
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “To get a horse to win, I’m very happy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now we’re aiming for the Derby, so we’ll have to get him to recover.” Also, Ho spoke about the stark difference between Super Sunny Sing now and just a few months ago
            </p>
            
            <p>

                On the ministry’s engagement on Saturday (Feb 25) with Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) and all telecommunications service providers to discuss 5G coverage in the country, Fahmi said a decision on whether to maintain the single wholesale network model in rolling out the network would be reached by the end of March

            <p>
                Last January, Fahmi was reported as saying that the ministry was expected to make an announcement on the 5G implementation by DNB with several improvements by the end of March.

                On the ministry’s engagement on Saturday (Feb 25) with Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) and all telecommunications service providers to discuss 5G coverage in the country, Fahmi said a decision on whether to maintain the single wholesale network model in rolling out the network would be reached by the end of March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last January, Fahmi was reported as saying that the ministry was expected to make an announcement on the 5G implementation by DNB with several improvements by the end of March.

                7 Jean-Philippe Mateta - Denied by Alisson early on and then wasted the best chance of the match in the first half when he lifted his shot against the bar

            <p>
                6 Diogo Jota - Too often a peripheral figure, he should have scored in the first half when he waited for, rather than met, a cross and wastefully struck the post

                The new housing project would serve as "another proud page in the history of youth movements" and a symbol of the country's socialist revolution and "political struggle", Kim said

            <p>
                "Being direct, being aggressive, being confident in front of goal, and I felt he wasn’t confident for a while actually, but this season he’s back to his best." United remain in the hunt for the quadruple in ten Hag's first season in charge

                WAYNE ROONEY has picked out the three things Erik ten Hag has changed to turn Manchester United into title contenders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United legend Rooney was part of the last truly successful squad when United ruled England under Sir Alex Ferguson
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He’s exactly what Manchester United have needed for a few years now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Being direct, being aggressive, being confident in front of goal, and I felt he wasn’t confident for a while actually, but this season he’s back to his best." United remain in the hunt for the quadruple in ten Hag's first season in charge

                Jürgen Klopp's late substitute did what none of his other midfielders were able to do against Crystal Palace and he was a rare shining light for Liverpool once again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp wanted a reaction from his Liverpool side against Crystal Palace after the demolition at Anfield by Real Madrid

                The Kia and Hyundai models being targeted by TikTok thieves were released between 2011 and 2021

            <p>
                The Chicago Police Department warned of an “astounding 767%” increase in vehicle thefts in 2021 due to the TikTok challenge

                Eighteen defendants were named in a class action lawsuit filed by one of FTX's customers, with Singapore's Temasek being one of them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The suit claimed that “defendant venture capital firms wielded their power, influence and deep pockets to launch FTX’s house of cards to its multibillion-dollar scale”

            <p>
                The 83-page document seen by The Straits Times alleges that the firms had been aware of fraud being committed by FTX, by virtue of having conducted due diligence checks prior to their investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “During this process, we enquired about the relationship, preferential treatment, and separation between Alameda and FTX, and were given appropriate confirmations that were contractually binding.” It reiterated that its US$275 million (S$370 million) investment in FTX was not for cryptocurrencies, with US$210 million going to a minority stake of about 1 per cent in Bahamas-headquartered FTX International, while the other US$65 million was for a minority stake of about 1.5 per cent in FTX US, the American subsidiary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2022 charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding FTX investors, and on Thursday he was handed four new criminal charges in a New York federal court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latest 12-count indictment accuses him of concealing from Alameda’s lenders and FTX’s equity investors the fact that Alameda had taken billions of dollars from FTX

                “During this process, we enquired about the relationship, preferential treatment, and separation between Alameda and FTX, and were given appropriate confirmations that were contractually binding.” It reiterated that its US$275 million (S$370 million) investment in FTX was not for cryptocurrencies, with US$210 million going to a minority stake of about 1 per cent in Bahamas-headquartered FTX International, while the other US$65 million was for a minority stake of about 1.5 per cent in FTX US, the American subsidiary

                Singapore will have a dozen of what is considered the world’s most modern fighter jet by 2030
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen’s announcement of the acquisition during the debate on his ministry’s budget on Friday means that Singapore will have a dozen of what is considered the world’s most modern fighter jet by 2030, which will enhance not just the air force, but also the capabilities of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is a given that the air force and SAF of the future will be more networked, and we fight as one system,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The maintenance cost of the fifth-generation fighter jets has also come down, according to Mr Ang Jer Meng, director of air systems at the Defence Science and Technology Agency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Defence experts said this capability also means the RSAF will be able to keep up combat air operations even without operational, full-length runways in the event of an enemy first strike, complicating any calculations to nullify Singapore’s defences
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The F-35 is also a stealthy jet, as its radar-absorbent material means it is able to evade enemy detection and operate in contested environments

                "China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis" sets out 12 detailed steps to handle the issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University's Institute of International Studies, said the paper is a summary of China's official position regarding the Ukraine crisis, which is "the largest military conflict in Europe since the end of the Cold War and has a direct impact on the security situation in Europe"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wu called for the early ending of the crisis, as global governance requires cooperation among major countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The Ukraine crisis has scaled up geopolitical tensions and decreased political mutual trust among major countries, which in turn has weakened their cooperation in global governance," he said

                "China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis" sets out 12 detailed steps to handle the issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University's Institute of International Studies, said the paper is a summary of China's official position regarding the Ukraine crisis, which is "the largest military conflict in Europe since the end of the Cold War and has a direct impact on the security situation in Europe"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wu called for the early ending of the crisis, as global governance requires cooperation among major countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The Ukraine crisis has scaled up geopolitical tensions and decreased political mutual trust among major countries, which in turn has weakened their cooperation in global governance," he said

            <p>
                On Friday (Feb 24), Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, when tabling Budget 2023, said beginning this year the income tax rate of resident individuals would be reduced by two percentage points for every income band from RM35,000 to RM100,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister said this was expected to benefit about 2.4 million taxpayers, thus increasing the disposable income of the M40 group by up to RM1,300
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said the tax reduction was in line with the prime minister’s desire to ease the financial burden of those in the B40 and M40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We can see from the structure of society that the T20 covers about 20 per cent of the Malaysian population with a certain income level, the M40 group is of middle income and B40 is of low income
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Here are four things to keep in mind as you plan for a $5 million retirement at age 55
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you manage your assets and plan for retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So if you make the national median income of $70,700 per year, you should plan to have around $570,000 in retirement savings before you stop working
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the other hand, it can take a lot of money to generate meaningful income. Fortunately, $5 million is indeed a lot of money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Medicare, on the other hand, can play a meaningful role in your retirement plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Consider working with a financial advisor to develop a comprehensive financial plan that addresses your income needs in retirement, estate plan and more. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard

                Dr Ng was speaking during the Committee of Supply debate on his ministry’s budget, where he also noted that defence spending in the current financial year will be a projected S$18 billion (RM59 billion), or a 5.6 per cent increase from financial year 2022

            <p>
                For instance, China is estimated to spend in excess of US$270 billion (S$364 billion) on its defence and announced a 7.1 per cent increase last year, while South Korea wants to bump up defence spending by an annual average of 6.8 per cent over the next five years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our lives and our country will depend on it.”  Increase in defence budget Dr Ng noted that some people had pushed for a cut in defence spending

            <p>
                Mindef will strive to keep the growth of Singapore’s defence budget in line with inflation, and it has achieved this target for the past decade at about 4.3 per cent growth each year, he added

                Dr Ng was speaking during the Committee of Supply debate on his ministry’s budget, where he also noted that defence spending in the current financial year will be a projected S$18 billion (RM59 billion), or a 5.6 per cent increase from financial year 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For instance, China is estimated to spend in excess of US$270 billion (S$364 billion) on its defence and announced a 7.1 per cent increase last year, while South Korea wants to bump up defence spending by an annual average of 6.8 per cent over the next five years
            </p>

                Mindef will strive to keep the growth of Singapore’s defence budget in line with inflation, and it has achieved this target for the past decade at about 4.3 per cent growth each year, he added

                Former member of Pejuang Centre Executive Council, Armin Baniaz Pahamin confirmed the matter through a Facebook post on Friday (Feb 24)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir had previously received an invitation by Putra president Datuk Ibrahim Ali to join the four-year-old party as its adviser after the party's supreme council decided on the matter at its meeting on Saturday (Feb 18)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former premier recently announced his exit from Pejuang, the party he formed in 2020, along with 12 other members, following the party's decision to cut ties with Gerakan Tanah Air

                Felda chairman Tan Sri Idris Jusoh said that after settling part of the debt out of a total amount of RM12.1bil, Felda was unable to carry out a second waiver

                "Repayment of the remaining loans will now continue as per the waiver agreement to ensure the survival of the organisation and enable Felda to continue to look after the welfare of the settlers," he said in a statement on Friday (Feb 25)

                "This commitment is proven when in 2022, the average productivity of settler smallholdings increased to 19.43 tonnes per hectare per year compared to 17.29 tonnes per hectare per year, representing an increase of more than 12 per cent

                More info Barcelona's players are adamant that they would have progressed to the Europa League round of 16 at the expense of Manchester United if three more of their stars were available to play at Old Trafford, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second leg at Old Trafford was a game of fine margins, with Barcelona opening the scoring thanks to an early Robert Lewandowski spot-kick before goals from Fred and Antony sent United through to the next round after a 2-2 draw in last week's first leg at the Nou Camp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The occasion also saw Barcelona dumped out of the Europa League for the second season in a row but their players are said to be 'convinced' that things would have gone differently if they had three extra players available for selection.That's according to Sport, who are reporting that the general consensus in the dressing room is that Barcelona would have won if Gavi, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele had played against United on Thursday evening
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They believe that football has been 'very cruel' to them over the course of this season and feel they were unlucky to be drawn into a difficult Champions League group before coming up against United in Europe's second-tier club competition

            <p>
                The scheme of the Federal Constitution requires that when investigating a criminal complaint, the relevant criminal investigative body must first consult the Chief Justice before commencing any investigations into a judge of the superior court

                It was in the light of the above that Tengku Maimun saw fit to list out a set of protocols which must be followed when a judge of the superior court is investigated, the first of which is for the relevant criminal investigative body to “first seek leave from the Chief Justice to investigate any Judge.” “The Chief Justice might know details that the investigative body does not and, in any case, informing the Chief Justice is necessary as a safeguard of judicial independence,” said Tengku Maimun

                The program is intended to improve gratuity reporting compliance and reduce the estimated $1.66 billion in annual unreported tip income

                It has been designed to take advantage of changes in how we tip and how employers monitor and report those tips to the IRS — with the aim of improving compliance and reducing unreported tip income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Tip Rate Determination Agreement (TRDA) allows the IRS and employers to agree on selected tip rates for different categories of employees, while the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (TRAC), has employers prepare a monthly report on tip income based on disclosures from employees who receive cash tips

            <p>
                If the program is implemented, servers may find they have less control over their reported tip income — and their tax bill may increase too

            <p>
                (Unless of course your tips amount to less than $20 in a month.) If you’re unsure how to handle reporting your tip income, O’Saben recommends speaking with your prospective employer about how tips are treated there and what interaction there will be between the two of you

            <p>
                Without good records, you’re at the mercy of the employer, the IRS, or both, when it comes to the amount of tip income you must report and pay tax on

                “EPF is pleased that the Budget 2023 announced earlier today takes into account the demographic changes resulting in an increasing number of an aging population as well as the significant shift in the employment landscape from formal to informal employment,” EPF chief executive officer Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan said in a statement today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amir was commenting on the proposal to contribute a one-off RM500 to EPF account holders with savings below RM10,000, extend the i-Saraan matching contribution scheme in 2023, expand the scope of tax relief for voluntary EPF contributions up to RM3,000, and the enhancement of EPF’s shariah savings accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, he said the expansion of tax relief for voluntary EPF contributions to the limit of RM3,000 will encourage more Malaysians to increase their retirement funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The wellbeing of Malaysians during their golden years remains a key priority and EPF will support the implementation of these initiatives to catalyse the accumulation of retirement savings for EPF members, with a view to helping them achieve a dignified retirement,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between 2020 and 2022, EPF members were allowed four early withdrawals of not more than RM10,000 each time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since then, Perikatan Nasional MPs have continued to call for targeted EPF withdrawals to help Malaysians cope with the cost-of-living crisis, but the current unity government has declined to allow it.

                The government's commitment to table the Control of Tobacco Products and Smoking Bill together with the Generational Endgame (GEG) can protect the younger generation from the smoking habit and reduce deaths due to diseases related to smoking and vaping, she added

                Allocation for emoluments, usually the largest component in operating spending, is projected to take up to 31 per cent of total expenditure, up by 1.4 per cent from last year

                In its Updates on Economic & Fiscal Outlook and Revenue Estimates 2023 report released today, the ministry said of the amount, 74.8 per cent will be utilised for operating expenditure while the remaining 25.2 per cent is for development expenditure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                MoF said funding for Budget 2023 will be sourced from income tax totalling 39.9 per cent of the total allocation, borrowings and use of government’s assets (24.5 per cent), non-tax revenue (19 per cent), indirect tax (14 per cent) and other direct tax (2.6 per cent)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to MoF, the fiscal deficit is expected to consolidate further to 5.0 per cent of GDP, to -RM93.94 billion from -RM99.48 billion in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                MoF said in the report that growth in 2022 was anchored by the services sector, which grew by 10.9 per cent and contributed 58.2 per cent share to the GDP, mainly supported by the wholesale and retail trade, transportation and storage, as well as real estate and business services sub-sectors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The growth was also attributed to robust external demand, especially among Malaysia’s major trading partners, which resulted in a 27.8 per cent increment to RM2.848 trillion total trade last year
            </p>

                Wendy Cheng was filming a video for a client in Orchard Road when she saw Phoon Chiu Yoke walking past without wearing a mask

            <p>
                Phoon Chiu Yoke, 55, who represented herself in court during the first day of the trial on Friday, is contesting four charges – three for failing to wear a mask when it was mandatory to do so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said that around 3pm on March 6, she was filming a video for a client outside Mandarin Gallery in Orchard Road when she saw Phoon walking past without wearing a mask
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In September 2022, Phoon was handed two charges of failing to wear a mask on March 6, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Phoon was also handed a charge for walking in Ion Orchard without a mask on Aug 16, 2022, from 11.48am to 12.03pm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The investigation was in relation to an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, concerning how Phoon had allegedly not worn a mask in March 2022

                Tengku Maimun said this while delivering a unanimous decision at the Federal Court on Friday (Feb 24) over an application to refer two constitutional questions relating to the MACC’s investigation on Court of Appeal judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali by two lawyers and an activist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tengku Maimun led a seven member panel in reading out the unanimous decision, among them were Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri Amar Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, acting Chief Judge of Malaya Datuk Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah, and Federal Court judges Datuk Nallini Pathmanathan, Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal and Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang.  In the ruling, she said that the protocol was that any investigative body needed to consult with the chief justice (CJ) first, before commencing probes against any judge.  The other protocols were that that public prosecutor must also consult with the CJ if they intend to prosecute the said judge, and facts of the investigation cannot be made public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The questions were posed by appellants activist Haris Ibrahim, and lawyers Nur Ain Mustapa and Sreekant Pillai.  “The failure to consult the chief justice, even if the chief justice is the subject of a criminal complaint, is thus a very strong indication of a lack of bona fides in a criminal investigation,” she said in reading out the judgement via Zoom proceedings on Friday (Feb 24) morning.  The first question pertains to whether criminal investigating bodies are only legally permitted to investigate judges of the High Court, the COA and the Federal Court who have been suspended
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The trio’s application to refer the questions of constitutional law to the apex court was allowed by the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a High Court judge previously, Nazlan presided over Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s SRC International Sdn Bhd criminal trial, and found the former prime minister guilty on all seven charges against him, sentencing him to 12 years’ imprisonment and a RM210 million fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the decision on Friday, Tengku Maimun also highlighted the “curious” timing of the investigation and press statement about the investigation by the MACC and noted that it came before Najib’s final appeal against his SRC conviction at the Federal Court last year.  “The curious timing of the investigation against Nazlan, which was done without consultation with the judiciary, also casts doubt on whether the investigation was bona fide,” she said.  She also added that the very notion that a judge is being investigated “is deleterious to the image of the judiciary as a whole”

                In this photo released by China's Xinhua News Agency, rescuers work at the site of a collapsed open pit coal mine in Alxa League in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Feb 23, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Six people had been pulled alive from the mine in Inner Mongolia by 10.30pm on Thursday, state media reported
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The open-pit mine operated by small local firm Xinjing Coal Mining collapsed in a landslide on Wednesday, leaving workers buried under a pile of debris half a kilometre wide and an estimated 80m high, said state broadcaster CCTV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Three hundred rescue workers were using heavy machinery and rescue dogs in their search for the miners, state media said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The mine, once underground, was converted to an open-pit operation in 2012, according to state media

                Liverpool looks destined to lose Joël Matip at some point within the next 18 months, and Jürgen Klopp can prepare with an ideal 'triple threat' transfer target
            </p>
            
            <p>
                RB Leipzig faced Manchester City in their own knockout bout, and picked up a respectable 1-1 draw against Liverpool's Premier League rivals

            <p>
                It is a small detail, but one that has been prioritised by most of Klopp's peers at the top of the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is one more underlying reason behind why the Croatian international is a perfect target for Klopp, potentially as a replacement for Matip — there has been talk of a potential summer sale, but Klopp will surely have to prepare for a parting of the ways in 2024 at the latest, when the Cameroonian's contract expires

                There is one more underlying reason behind why the Croatian international is a perfect target for Klopp, potentially as a replacement for Matip — there has been talk of a potential summer sale, but Klopp will surely have to prepare for a parting of the ways in 2024 at the latest, when the Cameroonian's contract expires

                About Us Advertise MANCHESTER, Feb 24 — Erik ten Hag’s transformation of Manchester United now has a European scalp to get excited about as Barcelona were vanquished on a night the Red Devils rolled back the years at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A six-year wait for silverware could come to an end when United face Newcastle in the League Cup final on Sunday

            <p>
                Without a league title in a decade, United are just five points adrift of Premier League leaders Arsenal and also into the FA Cup last 16, where they face West Ham at home

                Liverpool looks destined to lose Joël Matip at some point within the next 18 months, and Jürgen Klopp can prepare with an ideal 'triple threat' transfer target
            </p>
            
            <p>
                RB Leipzig faced Manchester City in their own knockout bout, and picked up a respectable 1-1 draw against Liverpool's Premier League rivals

                It is a small detail, but one that has been prioritised by most of Klopp's peers at the top of the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is one more underlying reason behind why the Croatian international is a perfect target for Klopp, potentially as a replacement for Matip — there has been talk of a potential summer sale, but Klopp will surely have to prepare for a parting of the ways in 2024 at the latest, when the Cameroonian's contract expires
            </p>

                Leipzig are one of the many clubs under the Red Bull umbrella, alongside the likes of New York and Salzburg

                Liverpool were tipped to make a shock transfer swoop for Arsenal star Bukayo Saka, whose current contract with the Gunners is due to expire in the summer of 2024 Bukayo Saka has ended Liverpool's hopes of signing him by agreeing a new contract with Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saka's current contract is due to expire in June 2024 after Arsenal triggered a one-year extension clause, but the Gunners have always been seeking to tie down one of manager Mikel Arteta's most important players on fresh terms

            <p>
                Saka has helped his boyhood club reach the top of the Premier League table this season, but there were rumours last summer which suggested that Liverpool were lining up a surprise move

            <p>
                As far back as August, Arteta made it clear that he was "very confident" the 21-year-old would sign a new deal

                Ukraine earned strong backing in a non-binding vote that saw 141 of the 193 UN members in support, seven opposed and 32, including China and India abstaining
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Coming on the eve of the first anniversary of the brutal war, support for Kyiv was little-changed from that of last October when 143 countries voted to condemn Russia’s declared annexation of four Ukraine regions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This vote shows that the international community stands with Ukraine.” The vote came after two days of debate during which Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the international community to choose “between good and evil.” He rejected the idea that Kyiv only enjoyed the support of the West — the European Union, the United States and their key allies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘Russia can stop tomorrow’  The resolution reaffirmed support for Ukraine’s “sovereignty” and “territorial integrity,” rejecting any Russian claims to the parts of the country it occupies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We support Russia and Ukraine moving towards each other, resuming direct dialogue as soon as possible,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But he also gave voice to one of Russia’s justifications for the invasion, that its own security was under threat by Ukraine’s tilt toward Western Europe and Nato

                THERE are currently no plans to review the tax structure for the automotive industry, especially the excise duty, says International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was responding to a question from MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong, who asked if the government has any plans to review tax structures in the automotive sector in order to lower car prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Does the government have any plans to review the existing tax structure, which has some impact on vehicle prices, and be able to reduce vehicle prices?” asked Dr Wee, the Ayer Hitam MP, in a supplementary question during Question Time

            <p>
                Tengku Zafrul said the government has no plans to review the tax structure for the automotive sector, especially the excise duty, which is important to spur the development of the industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This (excise duty) is to encourage local vendors to participate in the development of the automotive industry in the country,” said Tengku Zafrul, adding that the government had offered various incentives in the form of exemptions or reductions in excise duty and sales tax, in addition to the waiver of import duty for imported components used in the local assembly of vehicles

                “As a huge social security institution, EPF must cooperate with government agencies in building and strengthening a holistic and sustainable social security system for the well-being of Malaysians,” he said.

                Wine consultant Ch’ng Poh Tiong has worked with the NTUC wine-buying team for over 22 years and brings in his years of expertise on Bordeaux, having written the first Bordeaux wine guide in Chinese.  His insider tip is to look out for much older Bordeaux wines in the coming months

                As your monthly car costs increase, you can dodge a debt default by avoiding two common auto loan mistakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the fact that car prices started to cool off by the end of 2022, a concerning trend of auto loan defaults and car repossessions has started to surface
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are ways to save money as the cost of car ownership grows more cumbersome
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if you have $15,000 left to pay on your auto loan and your car is now worth $10,000, that means you have negative equity of $5,000 that you still have to pay
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you can’t pay off your old auto loan out of pocket, you’ll have to roll the negative equity over to your new loan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The older your car, the more likely you’ll have to spend money on repairs and maintenance in addition to your monthly loan payments

                Lawyer Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee, who represented Shafee, confirmed the date of the decision when contacted Thursday (Feb 23)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee was also represented by Datuk Seri Rajan Navaratnam while LHDN senior counsel Norzilah Abdul Hamid and Muhammad Faqrol Syazreen Mohd Ghause also acted for the LHDN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyer filed the application in May 2021, among others, on the grounds that the tax claim was an attack on him as a political victim in his capacity as a lawyer for Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and was considered to be an Umno lawyer even though he was not the party's lawyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 27, 2021, LHDN requested that the suit against Shafee be decided through direct judgment on the grounds that the defendant failed to pay the entire income tax arrears and the tax increase imposed on him amounting to RM9,414,708.32 within the stipulated period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LHDN, which filed the suit on May 6, 2021, claimed that until now, the lawyer had still failed to pay the amount of income tax owed for the Assessment Years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016 including the increase on the imposed sum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee is Najib's lawyer in the case of misappropriation of SRC International Sdn Bhd and 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds

                Lawyer Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee, who represented Shafee, confirmed the date of the decision when contacted Thursday (Feb 23)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee was also represented by Datuk Seri Rajan Navaratnam while LHDN senior counsel Norzilah Abdul Hamid and Muhammad Faqrol Syazreen Mohd Ghause also acted for the LHDN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyer filed the application in May 2021, among others, on the grounds that the tax claim was an attack on him as a political victim in his capacity as a lawyer for Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and was considered to be an Umno lawyer even though he was not the party's lawyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 27, 2021, LHDN requested that the suit against Shafee be decided through direct judgment on the grounds that the defendant failed to pay the entire income tax arrears and the tax increase imposed on him amounting to RM9,414,708.32 within the stipulated period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LHDN, which filed the suit on May 6, 2021, claimed that until now, the lawyer had still failed to pay the amount of income tax owed for the Assessment Years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016 including the increase on the imposed sum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee is Najib's lawyer in the case of misappropriation of SRC International Sdn Bhd and 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — The Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) has appealed to the Finance Ministry and the Public Service Department (JPA) to provide the Health Ministry (MoH) the support it needs concerning the public healthcare system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following a townhall session with the Health Ministry in Putrajaya yesterday, MMA president Dr Muruga Raj Rajathurai acknowledged that no immediate solutions were found, but stressed that the session was still an important step towards dealing with medical practitioners’ concerns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We understand from our meetings with MoH that the health minister has been in close engagement with both the MoF and the JPA,” he said in a statement here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for issues raised during the session, Dr Muruga said they were divided broadly into two categories namely human resources and infrastructure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Under infrastructure, MMA highlighted the need for proper development and maintenance of both physical and digital infrastructure including standardisation and proper maintenance to prevent a collapse of electronic records systems,” he said, adding that MMA would be following up with the ministry on their progress
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other issues highlighted were the need for transparency in MoH data, transparency in facilities assessments and the need for the reports on the fire at Hospital Sultanah Aminah Johor Bahru to be released to the public

                Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also Malaysia's finance minister, will unveil the country's 2023 Budget on Feb 24, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also the finance minister, has said that the new budget will not be linked to the one that was put forth in October by the previous administration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former finance minister Tengku Zafrul tabled a budget for 2023 in October last year with a government spending plan involving RM372.3 billion (US$80.06 billion)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Anwar was sworn in as prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A mini-budget was then tabled and approved in Parliament in December to ensure smooth operations of the government until the new budget is passed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So in this year’s budget, we will focus on these sectors,” said Mr Anwar during a keynote speech at the 2023 Budget Dialogue

                Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also Malaysia's finance minister, will unveil the country's 2023 Budget on Feb 24, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also the finance minister, has said that the new budget will not be linked to the one that was put forth in October by the previous administration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former finance minister Tengku Zafrul tabled a budget for 2023 in October last year with a government spending plan involving RM372.3 billion (US$80.06 billion)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Anwar was sworn in as prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A mini-budget was then tabled and approved in Parliament in December to ensure smooth operations of the government until the new budget is passed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So in this year’s budget, we will focus on these sectors,” said Mr Anwar during a keynote speech at the 2023 Budget Dialogue

                Dr Wee (BN-Ayer Hitam) said that the existing tax structure has some effects on the prices of vehicles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Does the government have any plans to review the existing tax structure, which has some impact on vehicle prices, and at the same time is able to reduce vehicle prices," he said in a supplementary question during Question Time in the Dewan Rakyat today (Feb 23)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In response, International Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said the government so far have no plans to review the tax structure for the automotive sector, especially the excise duty which is important in the development of the industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This (excise duty) is to encourage local vendors to participate in the development of the automotive industry in the country," added Tengku Zafrul

            <p>
                Explaining the matter, Tengku Zafrul said the government had offered various tax incentives in the form of exemptions or reductions in excise duty and sales tax, in addition to import duty for imported components for local assembly of vehicles

                In 2008, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Batu Puteh belonged to Singapore, while sovereignty over the nearby Middle Rocks was awarded to Malaysia

                We have yet to send the investigation paper to the AGC as we are still in the midst of our investigations," he told reporters at the MACC headquarters on Thursday (Feb 23)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was reported that the former premier claimed he was not a suspect in the Jana Wibawa programme probe and had no knowledge about the companies involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained to the MACC that he had all the papers to prove what went on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MACC investigating officer then read out the names of the companies but he did not recognise them

                We have yet to send the investigation paper to the AGC as we are still in the midst of our investigations," he told reporters at the MACC headquarters on Thursday (Feb 23)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was reported that the former premier claimed he was not a suspect in the Jana Wibawa programme probe and had no knowledge about the companies involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained to the MACC that he had all the papers to prove what went on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MACC investigating officer then read out the names of the companies but he did not recognise them

                KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 – At a town hall with government doctors yesterday, Dr Zaliha Mustafa gave little solid commitment to solutions for multiple chronic problems plaguing a public health service in crisis – amid the spectre of health worker strikes

                A seismic shake-up of the governance of English football, including the creation on an independent regulator for the elite game, will move closer with the publication of a wide-ranging government white paper on Thursday

            <p>
                It would also have the power to prevent English clubs from joining breakaway competitions such as the European Super League, which six Premier League clubs signalled their intent to join in 2021 before abandoning plans after a fans' backlash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "These bold new plans will put fans back at the heart of football and protect the rich heritage and traditions of our much-loved clubs." The Premier League, which has argued against the need for an independent regulator, said the white paper was a "significant moment" for English football, while the Football Association welcomed the commitment to improve the "financial sustainability and governance of professional clubs." Among the powers of the independent regulator would be to implement a licensing system from the Premier League down to the National League (fifth tier) and requiring clubs to demonstrate sound financial business models before being allowed to compete
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the Premier League, launched in 1992, has been an unprecedented financial success, lower down the English pyramid the situation has been grim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Premier League said it recognised the case for change in football governance and would carefully consider the government's plan for England to become the "first major nation to make football a government-regulated industry." It insists it has taken action to address issues raised in the Fan-Led Review and that £1.6bn is being reinvested down the pyramid over the next three seasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We will now work constructively with stakeholders to ensure that the proposed government regulator does not lead to any unintended consequences that could affect the Premier League's position as the most-watched football league in the world, reduce its competitiveness or put the unrivalled levels of funding we provide at risk," the Premier League said

                With Liverpool owner John W Henry having seemingly committed to the club, it is clear that FSG will need to back Liverpool in a number of ways to bring success back
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Of course, with Liverpool owner John W Henry having divulged that FSG does not plan to sell Liverpool in the immediate future, the focus will now shift to how best the club can ensure it stays competitive in the coming years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With this in mind, Liverpool will need to give themselves some stability in this regard

            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! With change does come the possibility that Liverpool could decide to take a different approach to the one they have so successfully employed during the FSG era of data-led signings

            <p>
                Josh does, however, warn against this as Liverpool looks to strengthen in a number of key areas including its midfield

                Malaysia’s Local Government Development Minister Nga Kor Ming is seen here in parliament on Feb 23, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Based on previous experiences and its benefits to the housing sector, the ministry will continue this kind of sharing session to ensure its policies and actions are more comprehensive and practical,” he said during the Minister’s Question Time in parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The minister was responding to a question by Perikatan Nasional (PN) lawmaker Shaharizukirnain Abd Kadir regarding the government’s rationale for bringing in Singapore housing experts to consult on housing issues in Malaysia given there are urban planning experts in the country.  Mr Nga also noted that under the previous administration, the ministry not only established collaborations with Singapore's Housing and Development Board (HDB) but also with other related housing-related agencies from countries such as South Korea and Australia.  “The government takes a modest and humble attitude in this matter as long as it benefits the people and the country, so what's wrong learning from neighbouring countries, not only Singapore but also Indonesia and Thailand," he said.  Mr Nga added that the engagement sessions with HDB had started in 2018 through a visit by the former housing and local government minister to understand the planning and provisions of housing in Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also noted that the HDB has received various awards and recognition at the international level related to the housing sector
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We see the success of HDB and they have managed to build more than one million units of affordable social housing,” he said.  “Actually, we are not only learning from Singapore but also from Türkiye as one of the efforts to advance the country, bringing development to all parties regardless of race.” In January, Mr Nga denied a report which claimed that the government had to bring in experts from Singapore to resolve Malaysia’s housing issues due to an “inefficient” civil service that handles public housing.  “Our intention to invite foreign experts, including from Singapore, for seminars and workshops, is to gain knowledge and share expertise in the field of housing so that Malaysia can move forward and be in step with current developments,” he was quoted as saying by Bernama.  Mr Nga also said at that time that the ministry’s staff had always provided the best service while implementing affordable and holistic housing policies for the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was also previously reported that Mr Nga’s plan to invite Singapore experts in a move to build more affordable homes in Malaysia was criticised by the opposition

                As your monthly car costs increase, you can dodge a debt default by avoiding two common auto loan mistakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the fact that car prices started to cool off by the end of 2022, a concerning trend of auto loan defaults and car repossessions has started to surface
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are ways to save money as the cost of car ownership grows more cumbersome
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if you have $15,000 left to pay on your auto loan and your car is now worth $10,000, that means you have negative equity of $5,000 that you still have to pay
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you can’t pay off your old auto loan out of pocket, you’ll have to roll the negative equity over to your new loan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The older your car, the more likely you’ll have to spend money on repairs and maintenance in addition to your monthly loan payments

                this affirms the fact that Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani is not friends with flamboyance and allowed very little to be known about him.
            </p>

                The third son of the controversial Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani may soon make sporting history in his pursuit of the coveted football club

                The Emir did not explain the change and named his fourth son, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the new crown prince (owner of the $400 million megayacht Katara)

                The Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, also shares a love for sports with his sibling and has been participating in competitive sports

                For the full FY2022, Genting’s net loss narrowed to RM299.91 million from RM1.37 billion a year earlier due to higher adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and lower pre-opening expenses

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — Former Klang MP Charles Santiago today questioned how chicken and eggs can remain affordable for the B60 or those in the bottom 60 per cent income tier in Malaysia if the government removes the maximum selling price after June, given that just a few companies dominate production of these food items
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He called for transparency in the government’s removal of price controls or plan to float the prices of chicken and eggs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Given that eight firms control 65 per cent of production, how will the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS) ensure chicken and egg prices remain affordable to the B60 while also meeting self-sufficiency needs? “As this dominance is alarming, the Malaysia Competition Commission should release its findings on cartel activities in the industry before the float is introduced, especially since the findings have been pending for too long now,” he said in a statement, without naming those eight companies

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 — Former Klang MP Charles Santiago today questioned how chicken and eggs can remain affordable for the B60 or those in the bottom 60 per cent income tier in Malaysia if the government removes the maximum selling price after June, given that just a few companies dominate production of these food items
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He called for transparency in the government’s removal of price controls or plan to float the prices of chicken and eggs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Given that eight firms control 65 per cent of production, how will the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS) ensure chicken and egg prices remain affordable to the B60 while also meeting self-sufficiency needs? “As this dominance is alarming, the Malaysia Competition Commission should release its findings on cartel activities in the industry before the float is introduced, especially since the findings have been pending for too long now,” he said in a statement, without naming those eight companies

                More Info The Iraqi central bank announced Wednesday that, for the first time, it plans to allow trade from China to be settled directly in yuan instead of the US dollar to improve access to foreign currency
            </p>

                According to a statement released by the Iraqi central bank, carrying out transactions in the Chinese currency would boost the balances of Iraqi banks with accounts with Chinese banks

                A second option to boost local banks’ yuan balances would involve converting US dollars held in the central bank’s accounts with JP Morgan and the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) to yuan before paying the final beneficiary in China

                Downer Transport Projects (DTP) is a distinct business unit under Downer that provides civil construction services in delivering transport projects for its customers, with specialist rail capability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some of the key projects currently carried out by DTP are in relation to rail line upgrades and duplication, rail extension, rail maintenance, service signalling and communication maintenance, and freeway upgrades

                The DTP acquisition is a strategic move for Gamuda and is in line with its growth plan of achieving A$3 billion in revenue annually in Australia within the next two to three years

            <p>
                "With the acquisition, Gamuda will be tapping DTP’s in-house capabilities and track record namely track infrastructure, light rail, stations, rail overhead lines, signalling, communications and integration, rail maintenance, specialist plant services and road and bridge construction,” the group said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that the consolidated capability and additional construction pipeline from DT Infrastructure across Australia will reinforce Gamuda’s position as they expand market reach in Australia by venturing into wider rail disciplines

            <p>

                Downer Transport Projects (DTP) is a distinct business unit under Downer that provides civil construction services in delivering transport projects for its customers, with specialist rail capability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some of the key projects currently carried out by DTP are in relation to rail line upgrades and duplication, rail extension, rail maintenance, service signalling and communication maintenance, and freeway upgrades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The DTP acquisition is a strategic move for Gamuda and is in line with its growth plan of achieving A$3 billion in revenue annually in Australia within the next two to three years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "With the acquisition, Gamuda will be tapping DTP’s in-house capabilities and track record namely track infrastructure, light rail, stations, rail overhead lines, signalling, communications and integration, rail maintenance, specialist plant services and road and bridge construction,” the group said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that the consolidated capability and additional construction pipeline from DT Infrastructure across Australia will reinforce Gamuda’s position as they expand market reach in Australia by venturing into wider rail disciplines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Gamuda will be well positioned to participate in a larger pipeline of transport projects focusing on rail, light rail and rail systems, with an established network of subcontractors,” it said

                "However, the economic recovery is still in its initial stage, and there is a need for our people and businesses to regain vigour." The city's economy is expected to grow 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent this year after contracting 3.5 per cent in 2022, Chan said

                "However, the economic recovery is still in its initial stage, and there is a need for our people and businesses to regain vigour." The city's economy is expected to grow 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent this year after contracting 3.5 per cent in 2022, Chan said

                Hong Kong will issue vouchers worth HK$5,000 (US$637) per person to all adults this year, half the amount issued in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The measure would benefit 37,000 buyers and cost the government HK$1.9 billion

            <p>
                Analysts say exposure to a weakening global economy and the need to keep up with US interest rate hikes to maintain the local currency's peg to the dollar will also lead to uncertainties over Hong Kong's economic recovery

            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that his position as the information chief is an executive position, it was rightful that he relinquished it until he is able to prove his innocence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Wan Saiful claimed trial for two bribery charges at the Sessions Court here, in connection with the government’s Jana Wibawa scheme back in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the second charge, Wan Saiful was accused of receiving RM6,962,694.54 from Nepturis in relation to the same government road project

                That being said, the resemblance to the CX-30 could be more than just in its size, and could also turn out to be the Mazda crossover with lights from Tesla
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously announced in October 2022 that the EV maker is working on a next-generation platform that would be half the price of the Model 3 and Model Y, and a model that is set to be priced in the region of US$25,000 (RM111,025) is expected to make its debut in 2023, this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The idea of a more affordable Tesla model was put forth by Musk as early as 2018, at which time the CEO said the company could produce in three years from that time, or 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When June 2021 rolled around, Musk said that the new model, which will be a hatchback, is planned for a 2023 debut
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One way that Tesla could manage costs with the new model is with its tabless 4680 battery cell design, which the company revealed at its Battery Day event in September 2020

                Currently, the cheapest Tesla on sale in Australia in the Model 3 RWD, which starts at AUD$64,300 (RM195,066) before on-road costs in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That being said, the resemblance to the CX-30 could be more than just in its size, and could also turn out to be the Mazda crossover with lights from Tesla
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously announced in October 2022 that the EV maker is working on a next-generation platform that would be half the price of the Model 3 and Model Y, and a model that is set to be priced in the region of US$25,000 (RM111,025) is expected to make its debut in 2023, this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The idea of a more affordable Tesla model was put forth by Musk as early as 2018, at which time the CEO said the company could produce in three years from that time, or 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When June 2021 rolled around, Musk said that the new model, which will be a hatchback, is planned for a 2023 debut
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One way that Tesla could manage costs with the new model is with its tabless 4680 battery cell design, which the company revealed at its Battery Day event in September 2020

                The jobless man pleaded not guilty when the charges under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act were read to him before Sessions Court Judge Azizah Ahmad yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When requesting the court for a lower bail, his lawyer Dayang Nor Emilia Azman Shah said the accused has a four-month-old baby with the victim’s mother and had lost his job as a lorry driver
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azizah set bail at RM3,000 for each charge with one surety and March 22 for mention
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When met after the court proceedings, Dayang Nor Emilia said the accused and the victim’s mother were not married but had stayed together

                He said the prices would be floated so that the Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Ministry (KPDN) could monitor and assess the fluctuations in the prices of the goods compared to the current ceiling price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are confident that the Agriculture and Food Security Ministry (MAFS) will satisfy the demand for chicken and eggs (through price floating), and even now, it is sufficient, but in five or six months, it will be more sufficient if no new undesirable matters (such as disasters) arise,” he told Bernama
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January, Mohamad reportedly said that MAFS was studying the need to float the price of eggs in the market and provide targeted subsidies to the B40 group and that discussions were being held with the Finance Ministry, Economy Ministry and KPDN over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current retail ceiling price in Peninsular Malaysia for standard chicken is RM9.40 per kg, and for eggs, it is 45 sen for Grade A, Grade B (43sen) and Grade C (41sen), respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, commenting on grain corn, which is almost 100% imported from Argentina and Brazil – affecting the price of chicken and eggs – Mohamad said the government was encouraging its cultivation in Malaysia this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Budget 2023, which will be tabled this Friday, Mohamad hoped there would be no reduction in the amount allocated to his ministry

                He said the prices would be floated so that the Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Ministry (KPDN) could monitor and assess the fluctuations in the prices of the goods compared to the current ceiling price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are confident that the Agriculture and Food Security Ministry (MAFS) will satisfy the demand for chicken and eggs (through price floating), and even now, it is sufficient, but in five or six months, it will be more sufficient if no new undesirable matters (such as disasters) arise,” he told Bernama
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January, Mohamad reportedly said that MAFS was studying the need to float the price of eggs in the market and provide targeted subsidies to the B40 group and that discussions were being held with the Finance Ministry, Economy Ministry and KPDN over the matter

            <p>
                The current retail ceiling price in Peninsular Malaysia for standard chicken is RM9.40 per kg, and for eggs, it is 45 sen for Grade A, Grade B (43sen) and Grade C (41sen), respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, commenting on grain corn, which is almost 100% imported from Argentina and Brazil – affecting the price of chicken and eggs – Mohamad said the government was encouraging its cultivation in Malaysia this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Budget 2023, which will be tabled this Friday, Mohamad hoped there would be no reduction in the amount allocated to his ministry

                MANCHESTER UNITED fans have begged the club to sign Victor Osimhen after his latest goal for Napoli
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Osimhen opened the scoring in the first half as Napoli beat 10-man Frankfurt 2-0 in the first leg of their Round of 16 tie, with another United transfer target Kolo Muani receiving a red card
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And United fans only had eyes for one man after the match - Osimhen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But many United supporters believe Osimhen is worth every penny so have called on the club to pull out all the stops to sign him

                ERIK TEN HAG has had a meeting with Sir Alex Ferguson ahead of Manchester United’s huge clash with Barcelona on Thursday

                And Sir Alex, who won United the treble in 1999, was clearly happy to share his wisdom on football and the club itself over dinner on Tuesday evening
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has United in the title race, the fifth round of the FA Cup, and they take on Newcastle in the final of the Carabao Cup on Sunday in search of their first trophy since 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ferguson of course claimed Manchester United’s last win over Barcelona by 1-0 in the Champions League semi-final second-leg in 2008 having fought out a goalless draw in the Nou Camp

            <p>
                "With the Russian side, we are ready to strengthen our strategic partnership and our in-depth cooperation" Wang Yi told Putin, according to a Russian translation of his statement

            <p>
                China's top diplomat insisted the partnership between the two countries was "not directed against any third country and does not give in to pressure"

                Whether Manchester United progress to the next phase could all depend on how Barcelona deal with the threat of the in-form attacker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford’s pace behind the Catalan defence was a weapon that Barcelona simply could not defuse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So how can Xavi set up his side to deal with the Man United man’s prowess? The answer is easier said than done of course, but there are two ways Barcelona can maintain Rashford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second method is more logical for Barcelona
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will allow Barcelona to keep their higher defensive stance while still having enough pace to keep up with Manchester United’s danger man when bearing down on goal
            </p>

                Whether Manchester United progress to the next phase could all depend on how Barcelona deal with the threat of the in-form attacker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford’s pace behind the Catalan defence was a weapon that Barcelona simply could not defuse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So how can Xavi set up his side to deal with the Man United man’s prowess? The answer is easier said than done of course, but there are two ways Barcelona can maintain Rashford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second method is more logical for Barcelona
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will allow Barcelona to keep their higher defensive stance while still having enough pace to keep up with Manchester United’s danger man when bearing down on goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcelona were struggling to play out from the back

                (Bloomberg) -- Lithium’s recent price collapse and the prospect that supply from new mines could accelerate the slump are stoking fierce debate in the electric-car battery industry

            <p>
                Signs of slower sales in China, the top EV market, along with concern about subsidy cuts and destocking activity across the battery supply chain have all weighed on lithium’s outlook
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wood said last week that the extraordinary run-up in prices of the metal had been a “clarion call” for more production, and that the response from the industry means “odds are high that lithium will be in excess supply.” China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, a leading industry group, has warned that rising supply could weigh on lithium prices this year, while BYD Co

                KIERAN TIERNEY is considering his future at Arsenal after becoming increasingly frustrated by his lack of action

            <p>
                Arteta, though, is unlikely to stand in the way of his departure as he has both Tomiyasu and recent signing Jakub Kiwior who can act as back-up to Zinchenko

                However, the foreign boy was not a stowaway attempting to sneak into the country but was instead unintentionally locked up in the container after playing in it with some friends in Chittagong, Bangladesh

                "During that period, the Home Ministry contacted the Bangladesh High Commission to help prepare his (travel) papers," he said, adding that the boy did not have any travel documents

                The South Klang police confirmed on Jan 20, that the boy was found in a container
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the foreign boy was not a stowaway attempting to sneak into the country but was instead unintentionally locked up in the container after playing in it with some friends in Chittagong, Bangladesh
            </p>
            
            <p>
                South Klang OCPD ACP Cha Hoong Fong said a port worker discovered the boy in a weak state in the container

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 — The prices of chicken and eggs are expected to be floated after June as part of the government’s efforts to overcome food shortage, says Agriculture and Food Security Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January, Mohamad reportedly said that MAFS was studying the need to float the price of eggs in the market and provide targeted subsidies to the B40 group, and that discussions were being held with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy and KPDN over the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current retail ceiling price in Peninsular Malaysia for standard chicken is RM9.40 per kg and for eggs, it is 45 sen for Grade A, Grade B (43 sen) and Grade C (41 sen) respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, commenting on grain corn, which is almost 100 per cent imported from Argentina and Brazil — affecting the price of chicken and eggs — Mohamad said the government was encouraging its cultivation in Malaysia this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Budget 2023 which will be tabled this Friday, Mohamad said he hoped there would be no reduction in the amount allocated to his ministry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to the 15th General Election at the end of last year, the government led by Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob had announced Budget 2023 with a total allocation of RM372.3 billion, and of the amount, RM5.32 billion was allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries

                Guotie, originating from Northern China, and Malaysia's roti canai

            <p>
                TasteAtlas, which focuses on food and features reviews as well as recommendations from culinary professionals and critics around the world, tweeted on Saturday (Feb 18) a ranking of the top 50 street foods in the world.  Guotie, which took the top place, is a pan-fried dumpling originating from Northern China that is commonly filled with minced pork, Chinese cabbage, scallions, ginger, rice wine, and sesame seed oil, according to TasteAtlas.  Coming in second is Malaysia’s savoury roti canai which is a flatbread with a soft interior that is pan-fried, commonly with ghee, to produce a crispy outer layer.  The dough, which is made with flour, water, eggs and fat, is repeatedly folded to give the flatbread a layered texture.  Also in the top 10 are Japan’s karaage which took the sixth spot, and Vietnam’s bánh mì which was in the seventh position.  Kaarage, or Japanese fried chicken, is pre-marinated chicken that is lightly coated in arrowroot starch before being deep-fried, creating a meat that is succulent on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The karaage dishes are usually seasoned with garlic and ginger and served with soy sauce on the side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other favourites that joined the top 50 list include China’s Shengjian mantou (pan-fried buns) (12th), Indonesia’s bubur ayam (chicken porridge) (13th), and South Korea’s hotteok (sweet pancake) (38th).

                Despite the defence’s insistence in August back then, the Federal Court’s five-judge panel led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat unanimously dismissed the defence’s bid for a postponement to be granted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee also touched on the necessity for a review of Tengku Maimun’s decision over the defence’s recusal application filed against her pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of the Federal Court 1995

            <p>
                This is a direct attack on Najib via her husband over the matter which is the subject matter of the charges Najib is facing,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A five-member panel presided over today’s hearing with Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Datuk Abdul Rahman Sebli leading; Federal Court judges Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, Datuk Nordin Hassan and Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abu Bakar Jais on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following his incarceration, Najib had since sought to challenge the Federal Court’s five-member bench’s August 2022 unanimous decision in affirming his conviction, sentence and fine meted out by the High Court for the misappropriation of RM42 million of SRC International Sdn Bhd fund
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Nazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal judge, had sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined him RM210 million in default five years imprisonment and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on December 8, 2021

                Despite the defence’s insistence in August back then, the Federal Court’s five-judge panel led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat unanimously dismissed the defence’s bid for a postponement to be granted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee also touched on the necessity for a review of Tengku Maimun’s decision over the defence’s recusal application filed against her pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of the Federal Court 1995
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is a direct attack on Najib via her husband over the matter which is the subject matter of the charges Najib is facing,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A five-member panel presided over today’s hearing with Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Datuk Abdul Rahman Sebli leading; Federal Court judges Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, Datuk Nordin Hassan and Court of Appeal judge Datuk Abu Bakar Jais on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following his incarceration, Najib had since sought to challenge the Federal Court’s five-member bench’s August 2022 unanimous decision in affirming his conviction, sentence and fine meted out by the High Court for the misappropriation of RM42 million of SRC International Sdn Bhd fund
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Nazlan, who is now a Court of Appeal judge, had sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined him RM210 million in default five years imprisonment and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on December 8, 2021

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 21 — Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH) should come up with a few travel options for Malaysian Muslim pilgrims based on how long they plan to stay in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Bera MP Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing data from the Muslim pilgrim’s fund, Ismail Sabri said the cost of the Haj has increased from RM25,540 last year to RM31,870 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the more the costs increase, the bigger the financial burden on LTH in subsidising the travel expenses for Muslim pilgrims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the four-day package will cover the necessary Haj obligations for Muslim pilgrims while those who opt for the longer packages would be able to visit Medina, another city in Saudi Arabia holy to Muslims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri also proposed a review of the Tabung Haji Act 1995, saying many provisions are now outdated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LTH executive director Datuk Seri Syed Saleh Syed Abdul Rahman said last month that the cost of completing a Haj pilgrimage has gone up to about RM31,000 this year, increasing by about RM2,368 from last season.

                About Us Advertise ANTAKYA, Feb 21 — Six people were killed in an earthquake which struck the border region of Turkiye and Syria, CNN Turk reported on Tuesday, two weeks after a larger quake killed more than 47,000 people and damaged or destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Monday’s quake, this time with a magnitude of 6.4, was centred near the southern Turkish city of Antakya and was felt in Syria, Egypt and Lebanon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said the quake struck while people were in the already damaged building to retrieve possessions before it was demolished
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They include 226,000 women in Turkiye and 130,000 in Syria, about 38,800 of whom will deliver in the next month

            <p>

                Smoke billows from the cooling towers of a coal-fired power plant in Ahmedabad, India, on Oct 13, 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many of India's power plants that use imported coal, including those owned by Adani Power and Tata Power in the western state of Gujarat, have not operated at full capacity recently because they have found it difficult to compete with power generated from cheap domestic coal

            <p>
                Reuters reported last month on India's plans to use the law to maximise coal power output
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the notice sent to all imported coal-based power plants, the ministry said it expects them to operate at full capacity and sell power to buyers on exchanges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                India's imported coal plants have a total capacity of 17 gigawatts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                India expects its power plants to burn about 8 per cent more coal in the financial year ending March 2024, with increased economic activity and erratic weather to continue to boost growth in demand for power

                Malaysia should also adopt neutrality in trade policies to attract investment for long-term economic stability, said Dr Jomo Kwame Sundram

            <p>
                In a recent interview with The Edge, Jomo said wasteful and unnecessary spending needs to be cut in line with the steady slowdown in direct tax collection over the decades

            <p>
                The subject of targeted subsidy has been in the spotlight, particularly targeted petrol subsidy, as the current blanket subsidy mechanism caused total subsidy bills to jump to RM80 billion last year amid elevated oil prices

                Premier League • England The agent of Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic reportedly blocked a big-money January switch to Manchester United, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Along with United, Chelsea have also registered an interest in signing Vlahovic, but it seems the Red Devils came very close to sealing a stunning winter switch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Spanish outlet AS, Juventus accepted an offer between €100m (£88.8m) and €120m (£106.5m) for Vlahovic from an unnamed Premier League club, believed to be Man Utd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, United are thought to be keen to bring in another quality striker for next season – someone who could link up effectively with Marcus Rashford, who is in the form of his career at the moment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But, it seems United we’re instead looking to bring in Vlahovic in January, who would have been a fantastic addition, and could’ve given them the firepower necessary to push for the Premier League title
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his agent rejecting a winter switch, United continue to be linked with Vlahovic, so there is a good chance that they will go back in for him this summer Recent reports suggest that Real Madrid are also interested in signing the Serbian, so United may have to battle them, and Chelsea, for his signature
