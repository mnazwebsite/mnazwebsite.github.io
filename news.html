                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 — The Inland Revenue Board's (LHDN) decision to end tax relief for National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) depositors will pose a huge financial impact on the middle-income families, Muar MP Syed Saddiq Abdul Rahman said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysia United Democratic Alliance (Muda) president said that without the tax relief, parents from the income group will have less incentive to kickstart an education fund for their children
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syed Saddiq added that the tax relief amount of RM8,000 is not a small number, and if it is carved out per year for seven years for example, it is a huge amount
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If we look at middle-class households, at least they will carve out five years before their child enters university, and that is about RM40,000 which that can spend for their child’s education,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syed Saddiq said this is an issue that is very close to him as he had helped underprivileged families in Muar to set up their SSPN savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "So that’s why I decided to help them start the SSPN savings by contributing RM500 to each family
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The students were aged seven to eight when the SSPN accounts were set up, Syed Saddiq said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement issued yesterday to confirm the tax relief removal, Deputy Finance Minister Steven Sim said the government will not extend the tax relief due to the additional tax relief that was made available such as the 2 per cent reduction on individual income tax, medical expenses tax relief which was increased from RM8,000 to RM10,000.

                The 40-year-old man was driving his car at KM9 on Jalan Sapong-Kemabong at 12.20am

            <p>
                After stopping and checking his car, the driver was stunned to find the body of a man stuck to the car’s undercarriage

            <p>
                A Fire and Rescue Department spokesman said it was believed the 55-year-old victim had fallen asleep on the road when he was run over by the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a separate statement, Tenom OCPD Deputy Supt Hasan Majid said the driver was heading to Tenom town from Kemabong when the incident occurred
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The road was unlit and the driver felt he hit something on the road which caused his car to become heavy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “After he got out to inspect his car, only then did he find the victim underneath his vehicle,” he added

            <p>
                The 40-year-old man was driving his car at KM9 on Jalan Sapong-Kemabong at 12.20am
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After stopping and checking his car, the driver was stunned to find the body of a man stuck to the car’s undercarriage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A Fire and Rescue Department spokesman said it was believed the 55-year-old victim had fallen asleep on the road when he was run over by the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a separate statement, Tenom OCPD Deputy Supt Hasan Majid said the driver was heading to Tenom town from Kemabong when the incident occurred
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The road was unlit and the driver felt he hit something on the road which caused his car to become heavy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “After he got out to inspect his car, only then did he find the victim underneath his vehicle,” he added
            </p>

                The £257mil (RM1.39bil) acquisition of Winchester House will ensure that Gamuda’s QTP programme moves into high gear in London and Europe in due course

                “This is the business model for Winchester House,” it noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The asset will be acquired from Wessex Winchester Ltd Partnership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was formed between the wholly owned subsidiary of Gamuda in Labuan, Gamuda Land (Labuan) Ltd, and Castleforge’s 100% partnership entity, Athelstan Ltd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashdan said acquiring Winchester House presents a strategic opportunity for Gamuda as the group expands its property development footprint to the BREEAM Outstanding club of properties, which are few and far between in London

                Cambodia's King Norodom Sihamoni meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim at the Royal Palace of Cambodia on Monday (March 27)

            <p>
                The Malaysian Prime Minister, in a Facebook post, said that during his audience with the King, he had delivered the Malaysian government’s intent to continue to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries that began 66 years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also paid a courtesy call on Cambodian Senate president Say Chhum and the National Assembly president Heng Samrin, during which they managed to exchange views
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Even with a busy schedule, I managed to meet up with the Malaysian diaspora at an event at the Malaysian embassy in Phnom Penh and was able to present the government’s intention that togetherness and unity would be expected even while abroad,” he said

            <p>
                Anwar arrived in Cambodia on Monday for a one-day official visit to strengthen bilateral relations and cooperation established in 1957

                In a statement on Monday (March 27), the firm said the bulk of these US$5 billion (RM22 billion) opportunities in Southeast Asia are in Indonesia, where upwards of US$2 billion of assets are on the market, followed by Malaysia and Vietnam which have approximately US$1.4 billion and US$1 billion for sale respectively

                At the Court of Appeal here yesterday, a three-judge panel chaired by Justice Hanipah Farikullah allowed Ahmad Zahid’s application to review the High Court’s decision on Feb 3 that dismissed his request to keep his personal and diplomatic passports with him permanently

                On Feb 3, Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah (now a Court of Appeal judge) only allowed Ahmad Zahid temporary access to his passport in order for the Bagan Datuk MP to have his diplomatic passport made

            <p>
                On Jan 20, Ahmad Zahid filed the application for permanent release of his passport, which he said was done bona fide (with good intentions) so he could perform his official duties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said he needed the passport back as he was required to travel out of the country as part of this duty and it would also help him apply for a diplomatic passport for official travel.

                When you need another stream of income for retirement, you might consider an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before buying an annuity, it’s important to consider how much monthly income it might generate

            <p>
                How Much Does a $300,000 Annuity Pay Per Month? How much a $300,000 annuity pays per month largely depends on when you purchase the annuity, how annuity funds are invested and how much time it has to grow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Using an annuity calculator can help you estimate how much money a $300,000 annuity (or an annuity in any other amount) may generate in monthly income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you have a specific monthly income need that you would like an annuity to meet, you might have to adjust the annuity amount to produce that level of income for yourself and your spouse

            <p>
                How Much Monthly Income Can I Expect From an Annuity? The amount of monthly income an annuity generates depends largely on the type of annuity, its face value and how much interest the annuity earns

            <p>
                “We often deny and ignore reality, looking for various excuses,” he said.Ahmad Khusairi said the most common comment about corruption among enforcement was that it was ‘an isolated incident’, and that it no longer could be used as an excuse to deny the reality of how rampant it was among enforcement personnel

            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Saturday, Cook told an audience at the CDF that Apple and China have grown together, and the relationship between the two is “symbiotic”

            <p>
                Since Cook orchestrated a retail expansion in China about a decade ago, Apple’s products have grown in popularity in the region

                Cook (centre) joins a number of US and European industry leaders who’ve met with Wang in recent days around the China Development Forum in Beijing

            <p>
                “Both sides exchanged views about Apple’s development in China and stabilising the industry supply chain,” according to a statement from Wang’s ministry on the meeting between the two
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wang also told the Apple CEO that China will continue to open up and provide good services to foreign firms including Apple
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Saturday, Cook told an audience at the CDF that Apple and China have grown together, and the relationship between the two is “symbiotic”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since Cook orchestrated a retail expansion in China about a decade ago, Apple’s products have grown in popularity in the region

            <p>
                This was used as evidence that the player was not yet at Conte's required level

                Conte did, however, inherit some good practices

            <p>
                Both Conte and Tottenham are responsible for that.

                Ma visits Hangzhou Yungu School in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China in this handout picture released on March 27, 2023

            <p>
                Ma has kept a low profile since late 2020, when a speech he made attacking Chinese regulators was followed by Beijing pulling Alibaba affiliate Ant Group’s planned IPO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But on Monday he visited a school founded by Alibaba partners in the eastern city of Hangzhou, according to a post on the school’s official social media account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ant Group said in January Ma had ceded control of the fintech company, adjusting its ownership structure so that “no shareholder, alone or jointly with other parties, will have control over Ant Group”

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 — Several victims of the Kelana Jaya Light Rail Transit (LRT) train crash in 2021 are suing Prasarana Malaysia and Rapid Rail Sdn Bhd for damages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plaintiffs are claiming that both Prasarana and Rapid Rail did not ensure the trains were safe to use and that the accident happened due to negligence on their part
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the May 24, 2021 incident, a train ferrying 213 passengers collided with a faulty train which was being test-driven (autonomously) in a tunnel between the Kampung Baru and KLCC stations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former Pasir Salak MP Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman, who was Prasarana chairman at the time, faced heavy criticism for his lack of empathy, lack of professionalism and remarks made during a press conference following the crash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had described the accident as two trains “kissing” and was seen jovial during the press conference immediately following the incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was subsequently sacked from his post on May 26, 2023 following an online petition calling for his termination as Prasarana chairman

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 — Several victims of the Kelana Jaya Light Rail Transit (LRT) train crash in 2021 are suing Prasarana Malaysia and Rapid Rail Sdn Bhd for damages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plaintiffs are claiming that both Prasarana and Rapid Rail did not ensure the trains were safe to use and that the accident happened due to negligence on their part
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the May 24, 2021 incident, a train ferrying 213 passengers collided with a faulty train which was being test-driven (autonomously) in a tunnel between the Kampung Baru and KLCC stations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former Pasir Salak MP Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman, who was Prasarana chairman at the time, faced heavy criticism for his lack of empathy, lack of professionalism and remarks made during a press conference following the crash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had described the accident as two trains “kissing” and was seen jovial during the press conference immediately following the incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was subsequently sacked from his post on May 26, 2023 following an online petition calling for his termination as Prasarana chairman
            </p>

                In his statement of claim, Lim said the former prime minister had defamed him in Facebook posts after being released on bail by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission on March 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim, who was finance minister from 2018 to 2020 during the Pakatan Harapan administration, claimed that Muhyiddin's statement also implied that he had cancelled the approved tax exemption status given to Yayasan Al-Bukhary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "His (Muhyiddin) statement implies that I misused my authority and ordered the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN) to impose taxes and penalties on a welfare foundation, which isn't the case," Lim's statement of claim said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim is also seeking an apology and retraction of the allegedly defamatory statements published on Muhyiddin's Facebook and Twitter accounts, which were published across major newspapers and portals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 21, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim confirmed in Parliament that Lim did not revoke the foundation's tax exempt status, which was contrary to Muhyiddin's claims.

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, March 27 — The Bandar Botanik Health Clinic in Klang, Selangor, now operates seven days a week, including on public holidays, as a pilot project to deal with overcrowding at the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital (HTAR) Emergency and Trauma Department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa said the implementation of the HTAR and Bandar Botanik Health Clinic cluster pilot project started last Saturday as agreed upon by the Special Task Force on Agency Reform (STAR)

            <p>
                “This is because the Emergency and Trauma Department should only treat serious and critical emergency cases,” she said in her speech at the Health Ministry’s (MOH) monthly assembly here today

            <p>
                Dr Zaliha said the change in patient arrival patterns from HTAR’s Emergency and Trauma Department to the Bandar Botanik Health Clinic would be monitored during the implementation of the pilot project
            </p>

                Sign up for our daily newsletter to get the day's biggest stories sent direct to your inbox We have more newsletters Given that Marcus Rashford has been in such scintillating form in front of goal so far this season, Manchester United's underwhelming goal return has gone somewhat unpunished
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the Portuguese ace having also registered 12 assists, his goal return is more than respectable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 29-year-old has impressed at Old Trafford since joining the club on loan from Bayern Munich in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While scoring has never been one of McTominay's main attributes, his second and third international goals show that the United man is capable of having an impact in front of goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The South American side ultimately lost 2-1 to Morocco on Saturday night, but the Reds midfielder - albeit somewhat fortunately - managed to score his sixth goal for his country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it will also be important that United's midfield players and wide men support Rashford

            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the Portuguese ace having also registered 12 assists, his goal return is more than respectable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 29-year-old has impressed at Old Trafford since joining the club on loan from Bayern Munich in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While scoring has never been one of McTominay's main attributes, his second and third international goals show that the United man is capable of having an impact in front of goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The South American side ultimately lost 2-1 to Morocco on Saturday night, but the Reds midfielder - albeit somewhat fortunately - managed to score his sixth goal for his country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it will also be important that United's midfield players and wide men support Rashford

                Conte, 53, arrived to take charge of the under-achieving Premier League outfit in November 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Levy reportedly became concerned about Conte’s mood swings this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The club were dumped out of both the FA Cup and Champions League earlier this month as Conte’s problems spiralled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It’s the right moment to speak because for me this is unacceptable,” Conte said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Tottenham’s story is this,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Initially the signs were encouraging for Conte, and for Tottenham as well

                Liverpool are ‘hovering’ for Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot as they look to get to the Frenchman before Man Utd, according to a report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rabiot is enjoying an excellent season with Juve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool will probably find it easier to agree a contract with Rabiot than Man Utd due to his existing love for the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They reveal that Liverpool are ‘hovering’ for Rabiot’s signature and could soon begin discussions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report urges Man Utd and Juve to ‘watch out for Liverpool’ as they are monitoring Rabiot closely
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But they know they will struggle to meet his demands and the money being offered by Liverpool or Man Utd

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, March 27 — Economy minister Rafizi Ramli expressed confidence today Malaysia would be able to achieve an inflation rate of 3.3 per cent after Malaysia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February remained unchanged at 129.8 or 3.7 per cent

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gamuda's wholly owned Gamuda Land (Labuan) Ltd holds a 75% stake in VB II, while Castleforge’s wholly-owned partnership entity Athelstan Ltd owns the remaining 25%

                The acquisition is part of its property development arm Gamuda Land’s quick-turnaround-project (QTP) strategy, which aims to build a regional portfolio of real estate projects with high internal rates of return with investment time frames of five years or less, Gamuda's filing showed

                Protestors demonstrate in front of 'Landungsbruecken' at the harbour during a nationwide strike called by the German trade union Verdi over a wage dispute in Hamburg, Germany, March 27, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Verdi is demanding a 10.5% wage increase, which would see pay rising by at least 500 euros per month, while EVG is asking for a 12% raise or at least 650 euros per month

                The walkout is the biggest in Germany, which has a long history of collective wage bargaining, since 1992, according to Verdi

                In the meantime, Loke who is also the Minister of Transport, said the target set is to defend the 16 state seats held by DAP in Selangor as a key performance indicator (KPI) for the formation of a mature and stable state government

                “So in Selangor, DAP must play a role as a party that provides opportunities to young people so that talents can be unearthed to keep the party’s leadership and machinery strong because many young leaders in DAP today started out in Selangor,” he said

                That would make Manchester United -- who have not won the Premier League for a decade -- the most expensive sports club in history, although it would be short of the £6 billion valuation reportedly placed on United by its current US-based owners, the Glazer family

                Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe, the founder of chemicals giant INEOS, remain the front runners to buy United should the Glazers give up control of the club

            <p>
                Zilliacus entered the race on Thursday, with a bid he said will give fans the chance to own 50 percent of the club

            <p>
                - 'Stupid prices' - Sheikh Jassim is bidding for 100 percent control, aiming to return the club to its "former glories"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A source close to Sheikh Jassim's bid had earlier told AFP he remains confident his bid is "the best for the club, fans and local community"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ratcliffe, who already owns French club Nice, said his interest in United would be "purely in winning things", calling the club a "community asset"

                That would make Manchester United -- who have not won the Premier League for a decade -- the most expensive sports club in history, although it would be short of the £6 billion valuation reportedly placed on United by its current US-based owners, the Glazer family

            <p>
                Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe, the founder of chemicals giant INEOS, remain the front runners to buy United should the Glazers give up control of the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zilliacus entered the race on Thursday, with a bid he said will give fans the chance to own 50 percent of the club

                - 'Stupid prices' - Sheikh Jassim is bidding for 100 percent control, aiming to return the club to its "former glories"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A source close to Sheikh Jassim's bid had earlier told AFP he remains confident his bid is "the best for the club, fans and local community"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ratcliffe, who already owns French club Nice, said his interest in United would be "purely in winning things", calling the club a "community asset"

                IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva reiterated her view that 2023 would be another challenging year

            <p>
                "Uncertainties are exceptionally high," with the outlook for the global economy likely to remain weak over the medium term, she told the China Development Forum

                The IMF forecasts China's economy to grow 5.2 percent this year, driven by a rebound in private consumption as the country reopens after its pandemic isolation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The robust rebound means China is set to account for around one third of global growth in 2023 -- giving a welcome lift to the world economy," she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "A 1.0 percentage point increase in GDP growth in China leads to 0.3 percentage point increase in growth in other Asian economies, on average -- a welcome boost." Georgieva urged China's policymakers to seek to raise productivity and rebalance the economy away from investment and towards more durable consumption-driven growth

                MMA president Dr Muruga Raj Rajathurai said the nation is still facing a shortage of medical professionals in the public and private sectors, with an ageing population expected in 2030

            <p>

                The sellers will make an attempt to pull the price below the 20-day EMA, and if successful, BNB could experience a drop to $300 and potentially to the 200-day SMA ($289)

                China said its foreign minister, Qin Gang, and Honduran Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina signed the deal on diplomatic recognition in Beijing, ending relations with Taiwan dating back to the 1940s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a brief statement late on Saturday, the Honduran foreign ministry said it recognised the People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate government that represents all of China and that Taiwan is an “inseparable part of Chinese territory”

                Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, in a video statement, said Taiwan will not compete with China in “meaningless” dollar diplomacy

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 —The Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah today said there is nothing to stop Muslims from visiting other places of worship

            <p>
                Sultan Sharafuddin shared a story where his late grandfather Sultan Alam Shah who was an attendee at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, had asked the state Mufti if he could participate in the event
            </p>

            <p>
                Sultan Sharafuddin also commented on the recent Selangor Islamic Religious Council (Mais) claims that activities, where Muslims visit non-Muslim houses of worship such as temples, churches, and gurdwaras to learn about these religions apart from their own, should be rejected and restricted
