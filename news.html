                (AP) — Union Pacific routinely hires private investigators to check out employees' medical leave claims and then fires anyone who happens to leave their house while out on leave, according to a lawsuit filed against the railroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific says it didn’t do anything wrong when it fired De’Ron Rutledge because railroad managers believed he was abusing the medical leave rules by repeatedly taking time off as he was recovering from a back injury he suffered on the job
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spokeswoman Robynn Tysver said UP follows all the rules for providing Family Medical Leave Act time off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If we learn that an employee is misusing FMLA, Union Pacific may take disciplinary action, as permitted under the law.” This whole situation might be less of a problem if employees had paid sick time, but the railroads have only started to address that concern in recent months through agreements giving some of their unions four days of paid sick time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the Texas case, Rutledge had worked various jobs at Union Pacific over 11 years leading up to working as a conductor before he was fired last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to his lawsuit, Rutledge had to take eight months off work to rehabilitate after the back injury in 2017 but after returning to the job he would occasionally need to take additional time off when his back condition flared up

                In a worrying sign, excess supply as reported by Tesla hit 13 days’ worth of sales at last quarter’s pace, a two-thirds increase over the year's end and its highest since the third quarter of 2020 drew to a close
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a growth stock that aspires to an average annual volume growth of 50%, a truly staggering figure in the manufacturing industry, it’s important to remember the market judges Tesla’s development differently from that of other incumbent carmakers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead of the typical focus on year-over-year volume gains—where Musk always impresses thanks to the growing adoption of EVs—investors importantly cast their judgment based on Tesla’s improvement from one quarter to the next

            <p>
                “Delivery growth will have to quicken [to] hit Musk’s annual target,” wrote Gene Munster, a managing partner with Deepwater Asset Management and Tesla bull
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The problem for Musk is that his carmaker is valued as a growth stock thanks to its prediction that annual sales will increase to 20 million vehicles a year by 2030

                In a worrying sign, excess supply as reported by Tesla hit 13 days’ worth of sales at last quarter’s pace, a two-thirds increase over the year's end and its highest since the third quarter of 2020 drew to a close
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a growth stock that aspires to an average annual volume growth of 50%, a truly staggering figure in the manufacturing industry, it’s important to remember the market judges Tesla’s development differently from that of other incumbent carmakers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead of the typical focus on year-over-year volume gains—where Musk always impresses thanks to the growing adoption of EVs—investors importantly cast their judgment based on Tesla’s improvement from one quarter to the next

            <p>
                “Delivery growth will have to quicken [to] hit Musk’s annual target,” wrote Gene Munster, a managing partner with Deepwater Asset Management and Tesla bull
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The problem for Musk is that his carmaker is valued as a growth stock thanks to its prediction that annual sales will increase to 20 million vehicles a year by 2030

                The longtime treaty allies agreed in February to expand cooperation in “strategic areas” of the country as they seek to counter China’s growing assertiveness over self-governed Taiwan and its building of bases in the South China Sea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Three of the sites are in the northern Philippines, including a naval base and airport in Cagayan province and an army camp in the neighbouring province of Isabela, the statement said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The naval base at Cagayan province's Santa Ana is about 400 kilometres (250 miles) from Taiwan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another site will be on Balabac Island, off the southern tip of Palawan Island, near the South China Sea

            <p>
                The pact stalled under former president Rodrigo Duterte, who favoured China over the country's former colonial master

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 — Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributors should be aware of default risks if they cannot repay the financing obtained from the Account 2 Support Facility (FSA2) in the required repayment period, said an economist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the support facility was designed to allow EPF contributors to obtain financing from financial institutions, and the money used as collateral involved their retirement funds
            </p>

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 — Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributors should be aware of default risks if they cannot repay the financing obtained from the Account 2 Support Facility (FSA2) in the required repayment period, said an economist

            <p>
                Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the support facility was designed to allow EPF contributors to obtain financing from financial institutions, and the money used as collateral involved their retirement funds

                Tesla (TSLA) on Sunday reported first quarter delivery and production numbers that topped estimates, indicating price cuts it initiated across the globe are boosting demand
            </p>

                For the quarter, Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles globally, which is an all-time record for the EV-maker

            <p>
                While Tesla doesn’t break out sales by region, global sales of the Model 3 and Model Y SUV surged, following price cuts for both vehicles both in the U.S

            <p>
                Tesla cut prices in China first, in early-January with the Chinese-made Model 3 falling by 13.5%, and the Model Y cut by 10%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tesla the cut prices in the U.S., with the Model 3 RWD falling by 6.4%, and the Model Y Long range dropping by nearly 20%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It had been reported since then that production wait time for the Model Y pushed out considerably after the IRS ruling

                Tesla (TSLA) on Sunday reported first quarter delivery and production numbers that topped estimates, indicating price cuts it initiated across the globe are boosting demand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the quarter, Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles globally, which is an all-time record for the EV-maker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Tesla doesn’t break out sales by region, global sales of the Model 3 and Model Y SUV surged, following price cuts for both vehicles both in the U.S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tesla cut prices in China first, in early-January with the Chinese-made Model 3 falling by 13.5%, and the Model Y cut by 10%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tesla the cut prices in the U.S., with the Model 3 RWD falling by 6.4%, and the Model Y Long range dropping by nearly 20%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It had been reported since then that production wait time for the Model Y pushed out considerably after the IRS ruling

                "We are on track to achieve the targets -- for example, this year, for inflation to be between 2.8 per cent and 3.8 per cent and economic growth to be between four and five per cent,” he told reporters after the annual BNM Governor's Address on the Malaysian Economy forum organised by the Malaysian Economic Association today

                Earlier in his keynote address, Fraziali said the monetary policy would continue to balance the risks to domestic inflation and economic growth and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will continue to monitor the impact of the past OPR adjustments on the economy

                According to the BNM Economic and Monetary Review 2022, the MPC monetary policy considerations would focus on managing inflation risks while supporting sustainable economic growth in 2023, and similar to other economies, 2023 will be a challenging year for the Malaysian economy with a more moderate economic growth projected and inflation expected to remain elevated

            <p>
                BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus in the report said over-adjustments in monetary policy would negatively impact growth, while undershooting could lead to inflation expectations becoming unhinged with damaging effects on consumers’ purchasing power and the sustainability of economic growth

                Meanwhile, the bench dismissed Muhammad Sanusi’s appeal to set aside the High Court’s decision, made on November 8, 2021, which ordered him to pay damages to Mahfuz after allowing the latter’s (Mahfuz) defamation lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the court’s decision, Justice Vazeer said that there was no error by the High Court judge in his findings on liability, but said that the quantum of damages awarded to Mahfuz by the High Court was low

            <p>
                Mahfuz filed the suit on Oct 9, 2029, over a post made by Muhammad Sanusi on his Facebook account on July 30 the same year, linking Mahfuz as the Pokok Sena Member of Parliament to the matter of the transfer of a Sports Toto outlet to the area

                On March 11, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said that the plan to allow EPF contributors to use their savings as collateral for loans would not involve any withdrawals from their savings

                This can be done through an advance application for the Age 50 or Age 55 Conditional Withdrawal, EPF said in a statement posted to its official Facebook page
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, this option is only available to Malaysian EPF members who have yet to reach the of 55
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Applicants must have at least RM3,000 in savings in EPF Account 2 and conditional withdrawal cannot exceed RM50,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The withdrawn amount will be paid to the banking institution once the member has reached either 50 or 55 years of age, as decided by the member
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 11, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said that the plan to allow EPF contributors to use their savings as collateral for loans would not involve any withdrawals from their savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar reiterated that the plan would only apply to those who are in bad financial straits

            <p>
                At press time, the benchmark Brent crude oil rose by 5.70 per cent to US$84.44 per barrel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist and social finance Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the move may seem to suggest that inflation could stay elevated if oil prices remain on the high side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, the US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Non-Farm Employment Change is expected to decline to 200,000 in March from 242,000 in February while the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) is estimated to fall to 240,000 in March from 311,000 in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time, the ringgit was traded mostly higher against Asean currencies

            <p>
                At press time, the benchmark Brent crude oil rose by 5.70 per cent to US$84.44 per barrel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist and social finance Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the move may seem to suggest that inflation could stay elevated if oil prices remain on the high side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, the US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Non-Farm Employment Change is expected to decline to 200,000 in March from 242,000 in February while the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) is estimated to fall to 240,000 in March from 311,000 in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time, the ringgit was traded mostly higher against Asean currencies

                Parent Action Group for Education chairman Datin Noor Azimah Abdul Rahim said the Education Ministry must be held accountable and find a way to solve the problem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noor Azimah said it was not enough for students to rely only on English as a subject for them to master the language
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Just learning one subject in English is not enough as it is only about 10% or 15% of the syllabus,” she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johor English Language Teaching Association president Vincent D’Silva said English was not only important for students’ tertiary education but also for them to enter the working world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When students enter universities, most of the courses are in English and they will struggle if they are not proficient in the language from the secondary level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Melaka Action Group for Parents in Education chairman Mak Chee Kin said education non-governmental groups had for years been urging the ministry to look into this issue, which he described as a ticking time bomb

                In Ampang Jaya, the two-hour parking limit has been introduced in only one area – the busy Jalan Memanda commercial district – nearby Ampang Point mall
            </p>
            
            <p>

                We’ll probably get a $10 move in crude.” Opec said the output cut was aimed at “stabilising” the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The reduction, of around 1.15m barrels per day,  is equal to about 1pc of global demand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the 1.15m-barrel cut announced, Saudi Arabia plans to cut output by 500,000 barrels per day, Iraq by 211,000 barrels per day and the UAE by 144,000 barrels per day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So is Russia, a member of the Opec-plus coalition, which plans to extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 barrels per day until the end of 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moscow announced the 500,000 barrel per day cut unilaterally in February, in response to price caps on its oil imposed by G7 countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its latest monthly oil market report, covering February, the International Energy Agency said oil demand was set to rise by 2 million barrels of oil per day in 2023 to 101.9 million barrels per day

                We’ll probably get a $10 move in crude.” Opec said the output cut was aimed at “stabilising” the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The reduction, of around 1.15m barrels per day,  is equal to about 1pc of global demand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the 1.15m-barrel cut announced, Saudi Arabia plans to cut output by 500,000 barrels per day, Iraq by 211,000 barrels per day and the UAE by 144,000 barrels per day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So is Russia, a member of the Opec-plus coalition, which plans to extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 barrels per day until the end of 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moscow announced the 500,000 barrel per day cut unilaterally in February, in response to price caps on its oil imposed by G7 countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its latest monthly oil market report, covering February, the International Energy Agency said oil demand was set to rise by 2 million barrels of oil per day in 2023 to 101.9 million barrels per day

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 2 — A Muslim-wear clothing boutique in Shah Alam, Selangor was ordered to close after some 500 people turned up to seize a purported ongoing bargain sale, with shoppers tussling with one another to purchase them at RM1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shah Alam police chief Assistant Commissioner Mohd Iqbal Ibrahim today said authorities were informed of a complaint around 10.30am yesterday, after a huge commotion took place at the clothing shop located in Section 7 of the Selangor state capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Iqbal said no reports have been lodged by either party over the incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No untoward incident took place
            </p>

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Chelsea's academy has been among the most productive in the world over the past few years, even if many of the players have only been sold to generate profit rather than actually supplement the first team

                By contrast, at Liverpool, while the situation with Klopp's squad has been at the other extreme at times this season, particularly in midfield, it has at least allowed the prodigiously talented Stefan Bajčetić to emerge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The situation at Liverpool this season has been far from perfect, of course, and this season, even if it ends with Champions League football being secured, will have been a disappointment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the joined-up thinking required to put that right is already in place, as Chelsea could suffer the unexpected consequences of a scattergun approach at the other end of the spectrum — allowing Liverpool and others to profit.

                The former Melaka chief minister said the proposed unity state government should be similar to the method adopted by the Federal Government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The state government will be doomed to fail if such insignificant exco portfolios are entrusted to Pakatan," he said in an interview here on Sunday (April 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Idris was commenting on a report by a Bahasa Malaysia news portal on Saturday (April 1) that two Pakatan representatives are expected to be absorbed under the new exco line-up that would be announced soon by Melaka Chief Minister Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Jusoh
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Idris said although Barisan Nasional commands the majority of the state seats, the formation of a unity state government would be a benchmark for the forthcoming six state elections

            <p>
                Over half a million dollars for a home is a lot of money for most Americans, but what does that look like in a monthly mortgage payment and how do you know if you can actually afford a home at that price point? Figuring out whether you can afford a home is a lot more involved than just looking at the home’s sticker price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are several rules and guidelines you can use to determine how much you can comfortably afford to pay for a home

            <p>
                Of course, these figures are highly dependent on mortgage rates (which fluctuate regularly) and your down payment

                Tze Liang, whose highest achievement was winning gold in the men’s 3 metre (m) springboard at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, has thrown down the gauntlet to his compatriots to step up in a bid to create more bigger splashes in the pool
            </p>
            
            <p>

                They have to win first,” he told reporters after taking home gold in the men’s 3m springboard at the 58th Malaysia Invitational Age Group (MIAG) Diving Championships here, today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the 29-year-old diver won’t be joining the 2023 SEA Games squad, he hoped that both Muhammad Syafiq Puteh and Gabriel Gilbert Daim will go all out so as to maintain their gold and silver medals respectively in the men’s 3m springboard event at the biennial games in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, next month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Tze Liang oozed class as he amassed 452.35 points to emerge as champion followed by another national diver Chew Yi Wei, who took silver with 407.10 points while Muhammad Syafiq had to settle for bronze with 402.70 points
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite unable to overcome Tze Liang in the men’s 3m springboard, Yi Wei still managed to take home gold for the national team, this time in the men’s synchronised 3m springboard with Gabriel after collecting 341.49 points

                In this handout photo provided by the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), PCG personnel walk beside the MV Lady Mary Joy that caught fire in Basilan, southern Philippines early Thursday, March 30, 2023

            <p>
                More than a dozen people died while other were reported missing after an inter-island cargo and passenger ferry with about 200 passengers and crew onboard caught fire close to midnight in the southern Philippines, a provincial governor said Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When a team of coast guard personnel, including Bureau of Fire officers, boarded the burned ferry on Baluk-baluk island's coast, they discovered the bodies of 18 passengers scattered on the uppermost open-air economy deck and another floor below, coast guard Commander Chadley Salahuddin said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The steel-hulled ferry could accommodate up to 430 people and was not overcrowded, said another coast guard official, Commodore Rejard Marfe

                Threats posed by Muslim insurgents, including those aligned with the Islamic State group, remain a security issue in the southern Philippines, where cargo and passenger ships are provided extra security by the coast guard and other law enforcement agencies in vulnerable regions

Meanwhile, Hua said Xi also met Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a separate meet where the Chinese President told Lee that the "Asian region has blazed a development path featuring independence, mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, openness, inclusion and win-win cooperation with Asian characteristics." "In a world with fast-evolving major changes unseen in a century, we need to value and defend the hard-won development momentum, firmly reject hegemony and bullying, and not allow any country to deprive Asian people of the right to pursue a better life," Xi told Lee

                Here’s how to make a six-figure income and pay no income taxes on it – all legally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tack on another $27,700 in income that is tax-free from a standard deduction, and you can escape income tax on at least $116,950
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By way of the deduction, all taxpayers get the first portion of their income tax-free
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard deduction can reduce any kind of income, such as investment income or earned income (money from a job)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Making $116,950 in tax-free income sounds great

                Here’s how to make a six-figure income and pay no income taxes on it – all legally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tack on another $27,700 in income that is tax-free from a standard deduction, and you can escape income tax on at least $116,950
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By way of the deduction, all taxpayers get the first portion of their income tax-free
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard deduction can reduce any kind of income, such as investment income or earned income (money from a job)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Making $116,950 in tax-free income sounds great
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 — Malaysia is poised to receive a massive boost to its economy following China’s commitment to invest a record RM170 billion, an analyst said

            <p>
                “On the other hand, to ensure that this investment commitments goes through, we also need to ease the process of doing business in Malaysia

            <p>
                So, we too need to ensure that we provide similar conveniences to them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The RM170 billion worth of investment commitments from China is the biggest so far from the republic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is from a total of 19 memoranda of understanding sealed between businesses in China and Malaysia

            <p>
                It is good for Malaysia and the future,” he said when announcing the news at the Malaysia-China Business Forum held in Beijing, China earlier today, which was attended by some 1,000 business leaders from both countries

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 — Malaysia is poised to receive a massive boost to its economy following China’s commitment to invest a record RM170 billion, an analyst said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On the other hand, to ensure that this investment commitments goes through, we also need to ease the process of doing business in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, we too need to ensure that we provide similar conveniences to them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The RM170 billion worth of investment commitments from China is the biggest so far from the republic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is from a total of 19 memoranda of understanding sealed between businesses in China and Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is good for Malaysia and the future,” he said when announcing the news at the Malaysia-China Business Forum held in Beijing, China earlier today, which was attended by some 1,000 business leaders from both countries

                by Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has given the go-ahead to sign Benfica striker Goncalo Ramos during the summer transfer window, according to AS

            <p>
                Hence, his reputation is rising quickly and United will need to move fast to secure his services ahead of their European rivals in the next transfer window

                The loan programme under the Giant Panda Conservation International Collaboration Programme Agreement allows Malaysia to conduct research on giant panda conservation and develop and train local expertise

            <p>
                To date, the panda pair, which were renamed Xing Xing and Liang Liang, has given birth to three cubs, namely Nuan Nuan, who was born on Aug 18, 2015; Yi Yi, on Jan 14, 2018; and Sheng Yi, on May 30, 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nuan Nuan was sent back to China in 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the agreement, each giant panda cub must be sent back to China when it reaches 24 months of age and no more than four years old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The presence of pandas at the Giant Panda Conservation Centre also contributed to the increase in the number of visitors and helped boost Zoo Negara’s income.

                “The panda cubs will be sent directly to Chengdu,” Rosly told Bernama
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The loan programme under the Giant Panda Conservation International Collaboration Programme Agreement allows Malaysia to conduct research on giant panda conservation and develop and train local expertise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To date, the panda pair, which were renamed Xing Xing and Liang Liang, has given birth to three cubs, namely Nuan Nuan, who was born on Aug 18, 2015; Yi Yi, on Jan 14, 2018; and Sheng Yi, on May 30, 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nuan Nuan was sent back to China in 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the agreement, each giant panda cub must be sent back to China when it reaches 24 months of age and no more than four years old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The presence of pandas at the Giant Panda Conservation Centre also contributed to the increase in the number of visitors and helped boost Zoo Negara’s income.

                The banking crisis isn't over, and its next chapter will involve one of the world's most important central banks, according to "Rich Dad Poor Dad" author Robert Kiyosaki

                In an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, the personal-finance guru expressed his bearishness on the current rally in markets, and warned Japan's central bank may be the next big institution to face turmoil

            <p>
                "The biggest bank that's going to go down is Bank of Japan," Kiyosaki said, pointing to the bank's heavy exposure to derivatives markets

            <p>
                The tech-focused bank failed in early March and sparked fear of a wider banking crisis, but observers say that the issues at the bank were more a case of bad risk management than the result of systemic weakness. Fed officials had reportedly spotted red flags at SVB for years before it finally went down

                Casemiro will miss Man United's next three Premier League fixtures after being sent-off prior to the international break

                Having introduced it for US companies late last year, Twitter’s verification programme for organisations has gone global

            <p>
                In Malaysia, it will cost RM4,500 per month for verification, and another RM230 per month if you want an affiliate (like a subsidiary brand, a leader, a spokesperson or an employee) vetted as well

            <p>
                As with Twitter Blue, the cost to get a gold checkmark in Malaysia is broadly similar to the US, where you’ll need to pay USD1,000 per month (around RM4,412) for verification and USD50 per month (around RM221) to add an affiliate

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 — Student group Ikatan Mahasiswa Demokratik Malaysia today chided Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Roziah Mohd Janor for claiming that it did not submit an application to host a dialogue session that was blocked by the university this week

                “This allegation is also very one-sided because the vice chancellor's office has not only denied the students' right to dialogue peacefully, but has even defamed us.” The student group affiliated with Malaysian United Democratic Alliance (Muda) said that UiTM had no problem approving the application and no issue was raised after it sent the documents applying to hold the dialogue session

            <p>
                It also said that a letter has been sent to the vice-chancellor’s office on March 27 to notify the university's top officials of the event

            <p>
                Prior to that, UiTM warned its students against participating in the dialogue session as students were only allowed to participate in programmes on-campus that have the university’s approval.

                “Apart from the lack of permanent posts, there are many other issues that are causing frustration among the public health care workforce which the government should focus on resolving now as some of the issues do not even require financial commitment to resolve,” he said in a statement today

            <p>
                On Wednesday, Anwar assured contract doctors that 1,500 of them would be made permanent this year and the government would need three years to resolve the problems they faced

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Public Health Organisation Malaysia advisor Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar, when contacted by Bernama, said the government assurance to resolve the contract doctor issues had given hope to the doctors involved and their families
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saying the government promise to absorb contract doctors into permanent service this year is a short-term solution, he suggested that the government look into the rate of appointment in relation to the number of existing contract doctors

                Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Services (Cuepacs) president Datuk Adnan Mat hoped that the Health Ministry and Public Service Department (JPA) would get Cuepacs involved in discussions to resolve the contract doctor issues

            <p>
                Adnan said going on strike would not resolve any issues and instead would create more problems especially for the people, who want the best service

                “Apart from the lack of permanent posts, there are many other issues that are causing frustration among the public health care workforce which the government should focus on resolving now as some of the issues do not even require financial commitment to resolve,” he said in a statement today

                On Wednesday, Anwar assured contract doctors that 1,500 of them would be made permanent this year and the government would need three years to resolve the problems they faced
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Public Health Organisation Malaysia advisor Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar, when contacted by Bernama, said the government assurance to resolve the contract doctor issues had given hope to the doctors involved and their families
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saying the government promise to absorb contract doctors into permanent service this year is a short-term solution, he suggested that the government look into the rate of appointment in relation to the number of existing contract doctors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Services (Cuepacs) president Datuk Adnan Mat hoped that the Health Ministry and Public Service Department (JPA) would get Cuepacs involved in discussions to resolve the contract doctor issues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Adnan said going on strike would not resolve any issues and instead would create more problems especially for the people, who want the best service

                While Ahmad’s Zahid management of UMNO is an internal party matter, the appointments to state agencies run counter to pledges the Pakatan Harapan (PH)-led coalition government made during the November polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid's actions have not only become a lightning rod for the opposition leaders, who are accusing Mr Anwar of backsliding on his election promises to bring about reforms in return for ensuring UMNO’s continued support for the coalition government.  They are also fuelling unease among senior PH leaders, who have long been wary about Mr Anwar’s move to strike a partnership with Ahmad Zahid and UMNO, sources told CNA.  “Making a deal with (Ahmad) Zahid and UMNO was always going to be problematic and that is now playing out,” said a senior PH minister, who also added that the issues over the appointments were being unfairly amplified because Ahmad Zahid was exercising his authority as minister over appointments involving agencies under his ministry.  “The problem with UMNO is that it believes it is business as usual even as a minority partner (in government) and Anwar’s challenge is to make sure that he draws the line when it comes to GLCs,” said the PH politician
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current uneasiness over how Ahmad Zahid has positioned his allies in government agencies reflects the messy state of Malaysia’s coalition politics following the 15th General Election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stakes are high for both Anwar and Ahmad Zahid on how the ruling coalition performs in the Malay-belt states
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Should UMNO show no improvement in the support from the Malays, the outcome would be considered a rejection of UMNO and Ahmad Zahid, who is battling corruption charges in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister, too, will have to account to his supporters for being too accommodating to UMNO.

                The prosecution filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal on Sept 26 last year against the Shah Alam High Court's decision to acquit and discharge Ahmad Zahid, who is now deputy prime minister, of all the charges after ruling that the prosecution had not made out a prima facie case against him

                According to the charge sheet, Ahmad Zahid was alleged to have committed those offences at Seri Satria, Precinct 16, Putrajaya and Country Heights, Kajang, between October 2014 and March 2018

                Luke Shaw is set to commit his long-term future to Manchester United after agreeing to a contract extension following an impressive campaign under Erik ten Hag Luke Shaw has agreed a new four-year contract at Manchester United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shaw has been exceptional under Erik ten Hag this term, having regained his place from Tyrell Malacia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United triggered an initial one-year extension in Shaw's contract in December to take him up until the end of next season, and now he has committed his long-term future to the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has been impressed with Shaw's attitude this season after the defender was dropped for United's 2-1 win over Liverpool in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Does Luke Shaw deserve a new contract? Let us know in the comments below!   However, Shaw regained his spot in the team for the 2-1 victory at Everton after Malacia struggled in the thrashing against Manchester City
            </p>

                Gerawat was replying to Sarawak Timber Association (STA) chairman Dato Henry Lau’s call to the state government to expedite the entry process of foreign workers from source countries other than Indonesia for the timber industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the timber industry, 250 APs have been approved in 2022 and only 24 were utilised, leaving a balance of 226 unutilised APs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that from January to March this year, 280 APs were approved for the timber industry, all of which have yet to be utilised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On STA’s complaint that the time taken to get approval was too long, Gerawat said his ministry had organised a review of the internal processes for hiring of foreign general workers which was jointly conducted by the state’s Department of Labour, Immigration Department, and the Immigration and Labour Management Unit

            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will slash approval time for foreign workers, enhance transparency, ensure integrity of the process for foreign workers applications and enable the enforcement and regulatory authorities to effectively monitor the entry and movement of foreign workers within the state, he added

                Now, it has emerged that Man Utd have also become a threat in the battle for Ndicka’s signature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Football Insider, Erik ten Hag’s side may well be the main rival to Liverpool on that front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report reminds that Man Utd are willing to sell club captain Harry Maguire in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judging from Football Insider‘s information, it could be a two-horse race between Man Utd and Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joining Man Utd might be more attractive at present because of their better form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, Ndicka might be able to carve out his own role more clearly with Liverpool

                Now, it has emerged that Man Utd have also become a threat in the battle for Ndicka’s signature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Football Insider, Erik ten Hag’s side may well be the main rival to Liverpool on that front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report reminds that Man Utd are willing to sell club captain Harry Maguire in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judging from Football Insider‘s information, it could be a two-horse race between Man Utd and Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joining Man Utd might be more attractive at present because of their better form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, Ndicka might be able to carve out his own role more clearly with Liverpool
            </p>

                The central bank said the DuitNow-NETS QR code payment linkage is a key milestone in the ongoing collaboration between Malaysia and Singapore to enhance cross-border payment connectivity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said the cross-border QR code payment linkage is a "significant step forward in realising the vision of an Asean network of fast, efficient, and interconnected retail payment systems.” "The QR linkage between Malaysia and Singapore will benefit millions of commuters across the Causeway as well as business and leisure travelers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to BNM, the initiative is a testament to both countries’ commitment to improving the cost, speed, access, and transparency of cross-border payments, in line with the Asean Payment Connectivity Initiative and the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank said the payment linkage would support in-person payments through the scanning of physical QR codes displayed by merchants, and online cross-border e-commerce transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the next phase, BNM and MAS plan to expand the payment linkage to enable cross-border account-to-account fund transfers and remittances, which would allow users to make real-time fund transfers between Malaysia and Singapore conveniently using just the recipient’s mobile phone number via DuitNow and PayNow

                The central bank said the DuitNow-NETS QR code payment linkage is a key milestone in the ongoing collaboration between Malaysia and Singapore to enhance cross-border payment connectivity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BNM governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said the cross-border QR code payment linkage is a "significant step forward in realising the vision of an Asean network of fast, efficient, and interconnected retail payment systems.” "The QR linkage between Malaysia and Singapore will benefit millions of commuters across the Causeway as well as business and leisure travelers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to BNM, the initiative is a testament to both countries’ commitment to improving the cost, speed, access, and transparency of cross-border payments, in line with the Asean Payment Connectivity Initiative and the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank said the payment linkage would support in-person payments through the scanning of physical QR codes displayed by merchants, and online cross-border e-commerce transactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the next phase, BNM and MAS plan to expand the payment linkage to enable cross-border account-to-account fund transfers and remittances, which would allow users to make real-time fund transfers between Malaysia and Singapore conveniently using just the recipient’s mobile phone number via DuitNow and PayNow

                United could yet win another two trophies before the end of the season and qualify for the Champions League, but first they must navigate one of their toughest tests yet

                United have taken 30 points at home this season, but just 20 in away matches this campaign

            <p>
                Retirement Income From $2.5 Million A retirement nest egg of $2.5 million can likely produce an annual income of $100,000 for as long as you are likely to live
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if inflation runs at the 2% rate that is the target of federal policymakers, the retiree will withdraw $100,000 the first year of retirement, $102,000 the second year, $104,040 the third year and so on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This would permit a 65-year-old retiree to maintain consistent purchasing power until age 95 and beyond

                Retirement Income From $2.5 Million A retirement nest egg of $2.5 million can likely produce an annual income of $100,000 for as long as you are likely to live
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if inflation runs at the 2% rate that is the target of federal policymakers, the retiree will withdraw $100,000 the first year of retirement, $102,000 the second year, $104,040 the third year and so on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This would permit a 65-year-old retiree to maintain consistent purchasing power until age 95 and beyond

                De Gea is facing an uncertain future at Man Utd after rejecting their opening offer of a new contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Man Utd want De Gea to reduce his wages before agreeing to stay at the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By making such a move, De Gea would reunite with former Man Utd boss Jose Mourinho, who gave him 113 of his 529 appearances for the club to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Man Utd haven’t been able to offer him enough yet, it is unlikely that Roma could usurp them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if there was a way for the transfer to materialise, De Gea might reunite with ex-Man Utd defender Chris Smalling and midfielder Nemanja Matic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, other sources have indicated there is still a confidence that he will renew his contract with Man Utd

                De Gea is facing an uncertain future at Man Utd after rejecting their opening offer of a new contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Man Utd want De Gea to reduce his wages before agreeing to stay at the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By making such a move, De Gea would reunite with former Man Utd boss Jose Mourinho, who gave him 113 of his 529 appearances for the club to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Man Utd haven’t been able to offer him enough yet, it is unlikely that Roma could usurp them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if there was a way for the transfer to materialise, De Gea might reunite with ex-Man Utd defender Chris Smalling and midfielder Nemanja Matic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, other sources have indicated there is still a confidence that he will renew his contract with Man Utd

                FOREIGN submarines must seek permission from Malaysian authorities should they want to sail submerged while in the country’s waters, says Defence Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad said the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) is clear on this issue, requiring any submarine passing through the territory of another nation to be on the surface
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If a foreign submarine, whether conventional or nuclear powered, wants to sail submerged underwater in our waters, permission must be sought from the Royal Malaysian Navy,” the Defence Minister said when answering a question raised by Lim Guan Eng (PH-Bagan)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim had asked about Malaysia’s stand on the recent A$368bil (RM1.08 trillion) deal by Australia to purchase eight submarines under the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (Aukus) enhanced security partnership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This was followed by a call from the United States Secretary of Defence and a meeting with the minister of state at the Ministry of Defence, the United Kingdom, on March 28,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad said during the discussions, he made it clear that Malaysia’s position on Aukus remains

                Premier League • England A Man Utd attacker has sent a message to Erik ten Hag over his minutes, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed two deals for the same player could soon be sanctioned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His first start for the club came on March 16 as Man Utd saw off Real Betis in the Europa League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, speaking to ESPN during the recent international break, Pellistri revealed his hunger to earn more minutes under Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Romano claimed another loan move could be sanctioned this summer, though only if he signs a new deal first
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “What’s going on right now is that for Pellistri, Man Utd are prepared to offer him a new contract and then decide if they want to send him on loan next season or keep him in the squad,” said Romano
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is something that, of course, has to be decided with Ten Hag.” Romano added Pellistri had loan proposals in January from “Bologna and Sassuolo in Italy, some Spanish clubs but also Flamengo in Brazil.” Ten Hag refused to greenlight a mid-season exit, though the story may be different six months later

            </p>
            
            <p>
                If their debit or credit cards were merely stolen, the scammers could have created a new Facebook account to use those stolen cards to run Facebook ads
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This clearly shows that the Facebook Ads scam requires the scammer to gain access to their Facebook accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can also improve your Facebook account security to prevent it from happening again

                First Citizens Bank picked up assets from collapsed Silicon Valley Bank at a deep discount, a deal negotiated in part by a billionaire family well-versed in buying failed banks.  Forbes looked at the Holding Family, the North Carolina banking dynasty behind First Citizens BancShares, which saw an opportunity to expand its banking empire after this month's implosion of SVB.  First Citizen's growth has accelerated in part through the purchases of more than 20 failed small banks since the 2008 global financial crisis, the report said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cumulative stake was worth $2.7 billion after a 54% stock price surge Monday following the SVB deal.  First Citizens with the SVB transaction is moving into the ranks of the largest 20 banks in the US, with $219 billion in assets

            <p>
                Its purchases of failed banks include First Regional Bank and Temecula Valley Bank in California and Denver-based United Western Bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its assets jumped from $109 billion just before the SVB deal and have increased from $16.7 billion at the end of 2008.  Before the SVB agreement, First Citizens' largest deal was the $2.2 billion buyout of bankrupt CIT Group in January 2022.  Under terms of the SVB deal, First Citizens, for a $16.5 billion discount, is taking over $119 billion in deposits and $72 billion worth of the failed bank's loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The FDIC will hold onto about $90 billion worth of securities and other assets.  First Citizens, founded in 1898, got underway as Bank of Smithfield and focused on farmers in Johnston County, North Carolina, Forbes stated

                But Uncle G has one big reservation about trading real estate as a digital asset — “everybody … forgets one little group called the SEC.” Generally, the SEC considers real estate tokens as “securities,” meaning they’re subject to disclosure and registration requirements, unlike pure brick-and-mortar real estate investments

                There is no age cap on your ability to convert to a Roth

                A financial advisor may help you understand how to manage the tax repercussions of a Roth conversion

            <p>
                Roth conversions make the most sense when you can choose to pay the income tax on your IRA balance and move it to a Roth in a relatively low-income tax year
            </p>

                Other Tax Implications Federal income tax gets all the attention when Roth conversions come up

                What Are RMDs? You don’t pay taxes on the money in your IRA or 401(k) when you put it in, which is why these accounts are considered tax-advantaged retirement accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The money will be taxed according to your current tax bracket in retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is beneficial if you are in a lower tax bracket in retirement than you were when you first earned the money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before the SECURE 2.0 Act, or the Securing a Strong Retirement Act, was signed into law, you had to take RMDs following the year you turn 72 or 70.5 if you were born before July 1, 1949
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line The SECURE 2.0 Act gives your tax-advantaged account more time to grow tax free before you have to withdraw money and, therefore, pay taxes on that money

                About Us Advertise   KUALA LUMPUR, March 31 — A large group of people did not miss the opportunity to turn a turf of cow grass from the Bukit Jalil National Stadium field here today into a memorable memento in their backyard or football field

            <p>
                The grass at the hallowed turf of the national football team was also the venue for the Harimau Malaya squad to qualify for the 2023 Asian Cup on merit, ending a wait of more than four decades last June, in addition to other sports and entertainment events
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the football faithful who turned up for a piece of football history, Erik Tan, 47, said he will keep the grass at home for precious memory by re-planting the turf in his yard

                Former Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou visits an exhibition on how China fought against COVID-19, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in handout picture released on Mar 30, 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ma arrived in China on Monday, the first time a former or sitting Taiwanese president has visited the country since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The two sides must maintain exchanges, cooperate together, and do everything possible to avoid war and conflict." China's official Xinhua news agency cited Song as telling Ma that people in China and Taiwan should both "resolutely oppose Taiwan independence separatist activities and interference from external forces, and jointly safeguard the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ma is visiting China at a time of heightened tension between Taipei and Beijing, as China ramps up military and diplomatic pressure to try and force the democratically governed island to accept Chinese sovereignty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She has repeatedly offered talks with China but been rebuffed, as Beijing views her as a separatist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, which Ma is a senior member of, says it is vital to speak to China to try and lessen tensions.

                A lower-than-expected result will indicate the labour market is still strong and encourage the Fed to continue raising rates to combat inflation.  Gross Domestic Product Annualized (Q4) will provide a perspective on general economic growth that could also effect Fed rate hike expectations, the US Dollar and Gold price

                This comes in spite of the news that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell admitted privately that the Fed still sees one more rate hike this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the revelation, the Fed Funds Futures Curve, a market-based gauge of what the Fed will do at future meetings, has only increased the chances of rate hike in May to 45% from 43% previously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A lower-than-expected result will indicate the labour market is still strong and encourage the Fed to continue raising rates to combat inflation.  Gross Domestic Product Annualized (Q4) will provide a perspective on general economic growth that could also effect Fed rate hike expectations, the US Dollar and Gold price

                Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa (pic) said this was to deal with the workload that exceeded the capacity of available resources, as well as to reduce the burden of the pension scheme borne by the country at the moment, which amounted to RM29.1bil in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "So, the way out is to absorb contract workers on a permanent basis, but without a pension, yet they enjoy the same benefits as other permanent workers, like eligible for housing loan," she said during the question and answer session in the Dewan Negara on Thursday (March 30)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was responding to a supplementary question from Datuk Jefridin Atan who wanted to know whether the Health Ministry was considering employing more contract doctors to overcome the workload of health workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Dr Zaliha said due to the increase in cases of non-communicable diseases (NCD) cases, the ministry was facing an increase in the number of in- and out-patients in health facilities, causing overcrowding in hospitals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The Health Ministry is also intensifying its digitalisation efforts to reduce the workload of MoH members, in addition to implementing scheduling practices that can help ensure members have sufficient rest time between shifts, including giving leave to health workers," she said

                China’s long-term battle to reduce the dollar’s dominance in world trade took two steps forward this week, with the first LNG trade in yuan, plus Brazil agreeing to trade via local currencies   China’s long-term battle to reduce the power and reach of US dollar hegemony took two steps forward this week

                The central bank said that a move to re-peg the ringgit to the US dollar would force the country to impose capital controls on financial flows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a boxed article accompanying its annual report for 2022, the central bank said that a move to re-peg the ringgit to the US dollar would force the country to impose capital controls on financial flows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Without capital controls, such an exchange rate regime would require the overnight policy rate (OPR) to match the rise in the interest rate of the country to which the ringgit is pegged

            <p>
                “This being the US dollar, the OPR would need to be raised by 475 basis points (more than four times higher than the cumulative 100-basis-point hike) to match the rise in the federal funds rate

            <p>
                According to Bank Negara, a 5% change in the ringgit-US dollar exchange rate is associated with a 0.2 percentage point change in core inflation over a year

                Bank Negara acknowledged that under a flexible exchange rate regime, large swings in the exchange rate within a very short time would exacerbate uncertainties and cause individuals and firms to delay their decisions to consume and invest

                Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said yesterday when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 or the national budget for the second reading in the Dewan Negara that the new initiatives include expanding the Hari Raya Aidilfitri assistance, a two-year extension of individual tax relief for the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN), and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said the increase is the biggest aid the government has ever given to fishermen, padi farmers and rubber smallholders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Budget 2023, tabled on Feb 24, the government announced the Special Aidilfitri Assistance of RM300 per month for fishermen and RM200 per month for padi farmers for a period of three months per season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for SSPN until 2024.“This was decided after hearing public concerns and complaints made to the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister also announced that, effective April 1, this year, the government will expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to those with fixed and fluctuating monthly incomes who want to own their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said the government would also prioritise filling public service positions in critical sectors, especially health and education, and this is expected to involve an additional expenditure of up to RM800mil this year

                As a sellable asset, however, cashing in on the Brazilian could well be an option available to Klopp if he wishes to free up further funds and decides that Liverpool has seen the best of the 29-year-old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either as a cut-price alternative to the aforementioned Bellingham or as a fresh option at the base of midfield, the potential signing of the 85-time international could prove astute for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given Brozović's invaluable experience and potential availability, the Croatian could be an ideal addition and free up funds in other areas during what is likely to be a busy summer at Anfield.

                Liverpool have heavily been linked with Jude Bellingham ahead of a potential summer move this summer but Jürgen Klopp could also do with more experience in midfield

            <p>
                As a sellable asset, however, cashing in on the Brazilian could well be an option available to Klopp if he wishes to free up further funds and decides that Liverpool has seen the best of the 29-year-old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either as a cut-price alternative to the aforementioned Bellingham or as a fresh option at the base of midfield, the potential signing of the 85-time international could prove astute for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given Brozović's invaluable experience and potential availability, the Croatian could be an ideal addition and free up funds in other areas during what is likely to be a busy summer at Anfield.

                China consumes over half of the world’s chips as a global manufacturing hub, but US companies are market leaders in chip activities that are most research-intensive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The concern was not only China’s tech rise, but the pace at which China’s tech rise was taking place

            <p>
                China’s chip purchases, meanwhile, have enabled Taiwanese and South Korean companies “selling at the doorsteps of China” to become the largest in the world, Wang added

                China consumes over half of the world’s chips as a global manufacturing hub, but US companies are market leaders in chip activities that are most research-intensive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The concern was not only China’s tech rise, but the pace at which China’s tech rise was taking place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And at the same time, the US-China strategic rivalry was intensifying,” he noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the USA also knows that China doesn’t have many other options to respond to this.” Currently, China consumes more than 50 per cent of global chips as the manufacturing hub of the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China has also condemned the provision in the US’ Chips Act that prevents American tech companies that receive funding from expanding their advanced chip manufacturing in China for 10 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China’s chip purchases, meanwhile, have enabled Taiwanese and South Korean companies “selling at the doorsteps of China” to become the largest in the world, Wang added

                We are urgently seeking further clarification from FIFA as to the details of the extension and its variance from the FIGC sanction." Spurs added that when Paratici conducted an interview on club channels on Tuesday, "neither he nor the Club had any indication of this decision being made by FIFA, based on the fact the the FIGC sanction was taken on 20 January 2023 and remains subject to an Appeal on 19 April 2023."

                After playing every minute of England's two Euro qualifiers during the international break, Harry Maguire will face a familiar situation when he returns to Manchester United ahead of their trip to Newcastle United this weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I've played nearly 200 times for Manchester United and I've captained the club for three years." Maguire lifted his first trophy as United captain in February after a 2-0 win over Newcastle, but it was shared with stand-in skipper Bruno Fernandes after Maguire was only asked to play the final two minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag decided to keep Maguire as captain last summer, but made a point to his squad that no player was guaranteed a place in the team and that everyone would be judged on form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because Ten Hag wants a right-footed player paired with a left-footed player in the centre of defence, Maguire has been competing for one place with Varane and hasn't done enough to dislodge the Frenchman since he was dropped for United's 2-1 win over Liverpool in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Maguire did decide to find a new club this summer, what options does he have? There was interest from West Ham in January, but the England defender decided to stay and fight for his place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United need to sell to boost the summer transfer budget, and it's likely any reasonable offer for Maguire will be considered, particularly if Ten Hag firms up his interest in Ajax's Jurrien Timber

                For example, Thailand’s tax rate is 14.1% of GDP, the Philippines is at 14% of GDP, Singapore 13%, and Vietnam 22.7%

                Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan concurred that the current model is indeed “unsustainable”, and that the current percentage of taxation revenue to GDP of 11.55% "cannot be continued"

            <p>
                Earlier, Ahmad told the Dewan Rakyat that tax revenue on average accounted for 11.55% of annual GDP between 2018 and 2023 (estimated)

                He listed measures that the government is taking to reduce debt, which include targeted subsidies, widening the tax base, reviewing and enhancing the tax structure, and providing tax incentives, as well as the proposed Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The proposed Act seeks to see Malaysia’s debt curbed below 60% of GDP, and the country’s debt service charges less than 15% of national revenue, said Ahmad

            <p>
                The MP for Pontian said the government wants to expand the tax revenue base, to improve and revise the tax structure and legislation, and to give tax incentives.  “We have also implemented a simple revenue strategy for three years, and this is to ensure that long-term tax planning is in order,” Ahmad said.  For more Parliament stories, click here

                “I have also not received any letter from the defendant to claim that she was forced to sign the bond,” said Saifuddin who appeared as a witness in suit filed by PKR against Zuraida for breaching the agreement (bond) that she had signed, Saifuddin said Zuraida as the former PKR vice president and also member of the party’s political bureau had attended a political bureau meeting at the PKR headquarters on April 17, 2018

                Saifuddin who appeared as PKR’s first witness said the bond requirement was to bind candidates and to ensure candidates understood that the party incurred a significant amount to promote the party and giving the candidates permission to use the party’s logo, flag, emblem when contesting under the party’s ticket
            </p>

                Betterment, for example, hiked interest on its cash reserve account to 4.2% APY this week

            <p>

                Betterment, for example, hiked interest on its cash reserve account to 4.2% APY this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With interest rates so high, there is a lot of money flowing to high-yield accounts—especially as market benchmarks like the S&P 500 have delivered only about 3.5% returns year to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Especially when you consider that inflation is up 6% year over year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If they're short on retirement savings, then no way would I tell them to reduce their savings in investments for a high-yield savings account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                stock market has provided a return of about 10% per year over the last century
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So if an investor had $10,000 in a savings account yielding a 5% APY for 30 years, they’d have about $43,000

                Ramkarpal said that the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2023 debated today aims to insert a new section 507(a) to provide for the offence of stalking, including acts that are considered an offence and to provide for a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment or a fine or both

            <p>
                Section 507(a) states that whoever repeatedly by any act of harassment, intending to cause, or knowing or ought to know that the act is likely to cause distress, fear or alarm to any person or the person’s safety, commits the offence of stalking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, subsection (1) states that the act of harassment may include following a person in any manner or by any means, communication or attempting to communicate with a person in any manner of by any means, loitering at the place of residence or business of a person and giving or sending anything to a person in any manner or by any means
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Further, whoever commits the offence of stalking shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or both and for final clarification the section uses the word ‘repeatedly’ which shall refer to at least two occasions.

                Investors should prepare for a period of US dollar weakness from the middle of this year onward, according to HSBC Global Private Banking

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 — Up to a quarter of household borrowers have debt-to-service ratios (DSR) of over 60 per cent as of December last year, Bank Negara Malaysia said in its 2022 Financial Stability Report even as it noted the risk of impairment remained low
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DSR is calculated by dividing a borrower’s total debt commitment per month by total monthly income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM), a government agency that insures depositors and takaful subscribers, deemed a safe DSR to be between 20 and 40 per cent of total income although lenders would generally consider borrowers with less than 60 per cent acceptable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loans continued to grow in the second half of 2022, up by 5.9 per cent from 5.7 per cent in June as the economy recovered from the strict containment measures meant to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the entire year, loan growth had recovered close to pre-pandemic levels, which averaged 6.2 per cent between 2015 and 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Two-thirds of newly approved loans in 2022 had DSRs below 60 per cent, a proportion unchanged since 2018.”

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 — Up to a quarter of household borrowers have debt-to-service ratios (DSR) of over 60 per cent as of December last year, Bank Negara Malaysia said in its 2022 Financial Stability Report even as it noted the risk of impairment remained low
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DSR is calculated by dividing a borrower’s total debt commitment per month by total monthly income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM), a government agency that insures depositors and takaful subscribers, deemed a safe DSR to be between 20 and 40 per cent of total income although lenders would generally consider borrowers with less than 60 per cent acceptable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loans continued to grow in the second half of 2022, up by 5.9 per cent from 5.7 per cent in June as the economy recovered from the strict containment measures meant to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the entire year, loan growth had recovered close to pre-pandemic levels, which averaged 6.2 per cent between 2015 and 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Two-thirds of newly approved loans in 2022 had DSRs below 60 per cent, a proportion unchanged since 2018.”

                PKR secretary-general Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said the bond signed on April 25, 2018 was a requirement for candidates who were chosen to contest on the party ticket and this was known by Zuraida

                In the statement of claim, Saifuddin said Zuraida executed a bond where she bound herself to pay the party a sum of RM10mil in accordance with the terms and conditions that had been set
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The conditions included agreeing to pay the party RM10mil no later than seven days upon the occurrence of such events as the resignation of the defendant from the party or joining any other political party, or being an independent elected representative after the defendant won the election on a PKR ticket

            <p>
                According to the statement of claim, Zuraida, together with 10 other PKR MPs, announced her resignation from the party without resigning from her elected post of Ampang MP on Feb 24, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Anwar, who is also the Finance Minister when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 or the national budget for the second reading in the Dewan Negara today said that the new additional initiative involves Aidilfitri assistance, an extension of individual tax relief and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for net savings in the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) until 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will incur losses of RM250 million per year in the government’s revenue, but will benefit approximately 400,000 taxpayers,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister also announced that starting April 1 this year, the government will expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to fixed and irregular income groups to have their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Anwar said the government would also give priority to the filling of public service positions in critical sectors, especially health and education, and this is expected to involve an additional expenditure of up to RM800 million this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Budget 2023 including the additional initiatives proved the Unity Government’s commitment to bring changes to Malaysia, and also proof of the government’s determination to improve governance to ensure the well-being of the people as a whole

                Kuwaiti public prosecutors had charged the defendants “as an organised criminal group” with having committed the crime of money laundering in Chinese currency, knowing that these funds were proceeds from crimes, theft of funds and investments of 1MDB.

                According to BNM's Financial Stability Review report for the second half of 2022, the vast majority, more than 80%, of banks in Malaysia would be able to maintain capital ratios above their internal capital targets, although 24 out of 54 banks, with a cumulative share of 25% of total banking system assets, would report losses in at least one year throughout the three-year stress horizon

                Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 for second reading in the Dewan Negara on Wednesday (March 29) said that the new additional initiative involves Aidilfitri assistance, an extension of individual tax relief and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for net savings in the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) until 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister also announced that starting April 1 this year, the government would expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to fixed and irregular income groups to purchase their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups

                Anwar, who is also the finance minister when tabling the Supply Bill 2023 or the national budget for the second reading in the Dewan Negara today said that the new additional initiative involves Aidilfitri assistance, an extension of individual tax relief and the provision of housing credit through the Syarikat Jaminan Kredit Perumahan (SJKP)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar also announced the extension of individual income tax relief of up to RM8,000 for net savings in the National Education Savings Scheme (SSPN) until 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will incur losses of RM250 million per year in the government’s revenue, but will benefit approximately 400,000 taxpayers,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister also announced that starting April 1 this year, the government will expand the target of the SJKP housing credit to fixed and irregular income groups to have their first home, an initiative that is expected to benefit the B40 and M40 groups
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Anwar said the government would also give priority to the filling of public service positions in critical sectors, especially health and education, and this is expected to involve an additional expenditure of up to RM800 million this year

                Chua, a former vice-president of debt markets at Hong Leong Investment Bank, pleaded guilty after the charges were read out to him before Sessions Court judge Kamarudin Kamsun
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deputy public prosecutor Hashley Tajudin had told the judge that the prosecution and Chua’s lawyers were amicable in asking the court to take into account the other 16 outstanding charges when passing the sentence
            </p>

            <p>
                For the charge, Chua used his position as a Veep at Hong Leong Investment Bank to dupe a Lim Boon Bing to invest the RM175,000 in a sham “QSR” IPO and promised him returns on his investment of 8.5% for the first month and 10% for the subsequent months

                Chua, a former vice-president of debt markets at Hong Leong Investment Bank, pleaded guilty after the charges were read out to him before Sessions Court judge Kamarudin Kamsun
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deputy public prosecutor Hashley Tajudin had told the judge that the prosecution and Chua’s lawyers were amicable in asking the court to take into account the other 16 outstanding charges when passing the sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that Chua has no more outstanding charges with the courts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chua had previously claimed trial to the other charges against him in June last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the charge, Chua used his position as a Veep at Hong Leong Investment Bank to dupe a Lim Boon Bing to invest the RM175,000 in a sham “QSR” IPO and promised him returns on his investment of 8.5% for the first month and 10% for the subsequent months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chua at all material times knew that the QSR IPO was a sham and did not exist

                The Southeast Asian country's economy has bounced back strongly from a pandemic slump, expanding at a 22-year high of 8.7 per cent in 2022, but its outlook for this year has been clouded by cooling global demand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In documents released with its annual report on Wednesday, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said risks to Malaysia's economy remain "fairly balanced", with the country expected to benefit from firm domestic demand, China's reopening, resilient labour markets, and a recovery in tourism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia's banks remain well-capitalised, BNM said, adding that recent volatility in the global banking sector has had minimal impact on the country's financial markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Headline and core inflation were projected to average between 2.8 per cent and 3.8 per cent in 2023, BNM said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at its two previous meetings this year, citing a need to assess the impact of four consecutive rate hikes in 2022 on the economy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Given the lingering uncertainties, any potential adjustments to the degree of monetary accommodation will be guided by the impact of evolving developments on balance of risk to inflation and growth."

                The Southeast Asian country's economy has bounced back strongly from a pandemic slump, expanding at a 22-year high of 8.7 per cent in 2022, but its outlook for this year has been clouded by cooling global demand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In documents released with its annual report on Wednesday, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said risks to Malaysia's economy remain "fairly balanced", with the country expected to benefit from firm domestic demand, China's reopening, resilient labour markets, and a recovery in tourism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia's banks remain well-capitalised, BNM said, adding that recent volatility in the global banking sector has had minimal impact on the country's financial markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Headline and core inflation were projected to average between 2.8 per cent and 3.8 per cent in 2023, BNM said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at its two previous meetings this year, citing a need to assess the impact of four consecutive rate hikes in 2022 on the economy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Given the lingering uncertainties, any potential adjustments to the degree of monetary accommodation will be guided by the impact of evolving developments on balance of risk to inflation and growth."

                In a statement, the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) said it was informed of the possibility of nicotine being removed from the prescription list of controlled substances under the Poisons Act in order for vape-containing nicotine to be sold in the public domain

                Judge Siti Aminah Ghazali meted out the sentence on Lim Chia Lin, 31, and ordered him to serve a year in prison if he fails to pay the fine following his guilty plea here yesterday

            <p>
                The complainant went to check the unit and found that several cat carcasses were inside a cage that was placed next to the door outside of the house
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cage was still there while the unit was unlocked, hence they went inside to check
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier in the proceedings, Lim, who was unrepresented, asked for a minimum sentence as he told the court that he only earned RM1,500 a month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “You can only plead for a lenient sentence now,” Siti Aminah said

            <p>
                Deputy Public Prosecutor Wan Ahmad Hakimi Wan Ahmad Jaafar asked the court to impose a long custodial sentence as a lesson to the public not to neglect their responsibility as a pet owner

                High Court judge Justice Ahmad Bache, who had struck out Najib’s suit against former attorney general Tan Sri Tommy Thomas last year, said the misfeasance in public office lawsuit filed by the former prime minister was a “non-starter” and had “no chance of success”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his full grounds of judgment, the judge said that for a tort of misfeasance and malicious process to exist, Thomas must have also conducted or been involved in the prosecution and the proceedings until the conclusion of Najib’s trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas, however, did not conduct or take part in the prosecution of Najib’s four 1MDB cases as some were still pending or had not even started when Thomas resigned on Feb 28, 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Ahmad had thrown out Najib’s lawsuit on Nov 25, 2022, with RM12,000 costs after allowing Thomas’s striking out application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that Thomas’s successor, Tan Sri Idrus Harun, did not withdraw the charges against Najib but instead pursued them, further lending credence to Thomas’s decision to charge Najib
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Oct 22, 2021, Najib filed the suit claiming that the charges against him were part of a move that had been planned in advance by Thomas and also in line with the Pakatan government’s plan at the time

            <p>

            <p>
                In the game against Hong Kong, Winger Akhyar got his second consecutive international goal when he finished off a clever pass from fellow winger Faisal Halim in the 18th minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the two goals, Malaysia looked lacklustre in the first-half, as some players were making wayward and loose passes, and Hong Kong dominated that half but was unlucky upfront
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The players were brought into the match to make sure Malaysia maintained its lead and ended the match with a win.

                They're one of only two WSL teams (along with bottom-placed Leicester) the only other team to be underperforming their xG
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, as per Opta ahead of the game Saturday, Manchester United have made the fewest changes of any WSL team when it comes to their starting XIs this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A team that's only in its fourth season in WSL, there is a constant need to contextualise how long the Red Devils have been around as a professional team and how long it takes to grow a team that can compete on all fronts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If United do finish in the top three this season, the larger worry is how they will fare in the Champions League next season, especially if Skinner continues with his lack of rotation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That said, their one point advantage over a Chelsea team with a game in hand may end up being worth little come the end of May
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Should Arsenal still be fighting for top-four (or the title), much like their rivals, the penultimate weekend of the season when they travel to Chelsea and United host City could be enough to confirm who will be playing in Europe next season

                They're one of only two WSL teams (along with bottom-placed Leicester) the only other team to be underperforming their xG
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, as per Opta ahead of the game Saturday, Manchester United have made the fewest changes of any WSL team when it comes to their starting XIs this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A team that's only in its fourth season in WSL, there is a constant need to contextualise how long the Red Devils have been around as a professional team and how long it takes to grow a team that can compete on all fronts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If United do finish in the top three this season, the larger worry is how they will fare in the Champions League next season, especially if Skinner continues with his lack of rotation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That said, their one point advantage over a Chelsea team with a game in hand may end up being worth little come the end of May
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Should Arsenal still be fighting for top-four (or the title), much like their rivals, the penultimate weekend of the season when they travel to Chelsea and United host City could be enough to confirm who will be playing in Europe next season

            <p>
                According to a report by the Shah Alam Fire and Rescue Department, one affected car owner in Jalan Anggerik Mokara prevented its officer from helping to clear away the tree debris before an MBSA officer could arrive

            <p>
                For cars that sustain such damage from trees under MBSA's purview, the owners need to lodge a police report and proceed to the Customer Service Department first floor of Wisma MBSA with their MyKad, vehicle grant and letter of claim.

                Batu Pahat OCPD Asst Comm Ismail Dollah said the accident occurred at 3.30pm on Monday (March 27) when two of the suspects, aged 31 and 39, were in an SUV trailing a Proton car from Tongkang Pechah to Parit Sulong

                The driver, 42, and passenger, 43, of the other car suffered minor injuries," ACP Ismail said in a statement on Wednesday (March 29)

            <p>
                The case would be investigated under Section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act 1987 for causing death by reckless driving, Section 304(b) of the Penal Code for causing death by negligence, and Section 379 of the Penal Code for theft, he added

            <p>
