                The income thresholds for the seven federal tax brackets increased by a bigger-than-normal amount for the 2023 tax year to reflect runaway inflation seen last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "More dramatic this year since inflation was also dramatic.” The inflation-adjusted amounts jumped by more than 7% from 2022, according to the Tax Policy Center, compared with last year's 3% uptick

            <p>
                According to the Tax Foundation, this occurs when inflation pushes you into a higher income tax bracket, which will reduce the value of credits, deductions, and exemptions

                (Bloomberg) -- Ken Griffin’s Citadel churned out a record $16 billion in profit for clients last year, outperforming the rest of the industry and one of history’s most successful financial plays
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citadel’s gain was the largest annual return for a hedge fund manager, surpassing the $15 billion that John Paulson generated in 2007 on his bet against subprime mortgages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it’s a different story outside the industry giants, with hedge funds overall losing $208 billion last year as many managers found themselves on the wrong side of global market turmoil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The findings also reflect the growing clout of multistrategy hedge fund firms, which are on the cusp of taking over equity-focused funds to become the dominant strategy in the industry

                In the first quarter, Spain had two penalty corners, one in the first minute and the second in the 12th minute
            </p>
            
            <p>

                In the second quarter, Malaysia looked better in terms of movement and circle penetration, but Spain had the best chance in the 20th minute when Joaquin Menini unleashed a reverse stick shot, which Hafizuddin saved beautifully

                Spain's resurgence was rewarded when they got a penalty stroke in the 40th minute, and Marc Miralles buried it from the spot

                Liverpool is reportedly interested in signing a young defender who fits the FSG model, and has compared himself to Virgil van Dijk — not without reason
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool is still very much keeping an eye on the best prospects from abroad

            <p>
                And it seems like one player who Liverpool could be targeting is a center-back, which would make sense considering two of the club's senior defenders in Virgil van Dijk and Joël Matip are entering their twilight years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bångsbo has won 70.1 per cent of his 3.88 defensive duels per 90 in his debut season for his club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has also averaged 4.63 interceptions and 9.56 recoveries per 90 as per Wyscout
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked about where he would like to play and which player he resembles the most, he also picked out similarities to Van Dijk

                Liverpool is reportedly interested in signing a young defender who fits the FSG model, and has compared himself to Virgil van Dijk — not without reason
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool is still very much keeping an eye on the best prospects from abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And it seems like one player who Liverpool could be targeting is a center-back, which would make sense considering two of the club's senior defenders in Virgil van Dijk and Joël Matip are entering their twilight years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bångsbo has won 70.1 per cent of his 3.88 defensive duels per 90 in his debut season for his club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has also averaged 4.63 interceptions and 9.56 recoveries per 90 as per Wyscout
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked about where he would like to play and which player he resembles the most, he also picked out similarities to Van Dijk

                Modi was later named the head of his party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which he led to power in general elections in 2014 and then in 2019
