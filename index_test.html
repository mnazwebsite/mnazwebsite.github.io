                After failing to get more time to handle his appeal the court heard today that Najib would discharge Zaid's firm from his case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib explained that he opted to discharge Muhammad Shafee and his team after losing both his case and his appeal at the High Court and the Court of Appeal respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hearing at the country’s supreme court had been scheduled to take place over nine days, from August 15 to August 19, and will resume after this weekend from August 23 to August 26

            <p>
                August 15 and 16 were spent hearing Najib’s bid to add new evidence and seek a postponement that was ultimately disallowed by the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court then fixed August 18 as the start of the main SRC International appeal hearing

            <p>
                The case is now at the Federal Court, and it is Najib’s last chance to convince the judges that his conviction and punishment should be overturned.

                Further, he said the present Attorney-General Idrus Harun, has given a fiat to Alan Gomez and Lai Wei Shiung to represent Thomas

                Firoz Hussein Ahmad Jamaluddin, who represented Najib, argued last week that the lawyers should not act for Thomas as he was a party to the present suit

                Further, he said, Thomas was the founder of Tommy Thomas Advocates & Solicitors and the lawyers are now its partners and shareholders, resulting in them not being able to maintain professional independence and act objectively in the best interest of the administration of justice

                In his statement of claim, the former prime minister claimed that Umno president Zahid had issued a defamatory statement against him during the party’s divisional meeting at Kelana Jaya on July 30, 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mahathir claimed the statement was meant to imply that he was not born a Malay or a Muslim, with the alleged original name of “Mahathir son of Iskandar Kutty”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said the statement suggested he claimed to be a Malay when he became the prime minister to gain political and personal advantage, apart from belittling Malaysians of Indian Muslim descent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid, in his statement of defence filed on Aug 17 through Messrs Shahrul Hamidi & Haziq, denied that the statement was malicious to slander and harm Mahathir’s reputation in the public eye
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that the name “Mahathir son of Iskandar Kutty” referred to an individual based on the information in an old copy of an identity card, and said he also had no control over any video publication regarding his statement on the media platform
            </p>

                PH Youth said Ismail’s action is tantamount to abuse of power

                “Any attempt to use civil servants to defend the government must be strongly rejected,” it said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Civil servants should adhere to the principle of neutrality in ensuring that the delivery of government services is not affected, even if there is any change in leadership.” The statement was signed by PH and DAP Youth chief Dr Kelvin Yii, PKR Youth chief Adam Adli, Amanah Youth chief Hasbie Muda and Upko Youth chief Felix Joseph Saang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former PH government also introduced regulations to prohibit top civil servants, as well as those in managerial and professional roles, from being involved in politics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During a meeting with staff of the Prime Minister’s Department on Tuesday, Ismail said it would be apt for civil servants to defend the government against allegations that the government under his administration had failed

                On allegations that the police were linked to a network of fake social media accounts and pages that tried to boost support for the government and run down the opposition, PH Youth said Ismail’s message to the public servants only served to add credence to such claims

                Judge Nazlan Ghazali, who read the broad grounds, said the three-member bench found that High Court judge Firuz Jaffril was correct to dismiss their suit last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In August last year, Firuz had granted a declaration to Jamaluddin’s mother, Aminah Abdullah, that the three million shares worth RM1.044 billion in Rantai Wawasan Sdn Bhd were part of her son’s estate, to which she was entitled to as a beneficiary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We, therefore, affirm the decision of the High Court and dismiss the defendants’ appeal,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The appellate court also dismissed Aminah’s appeal that shares worth RM313 million in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd should revert to her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As such, we also affirm the decision of the High Court which had refused a declaration sought by Aminah that the shares in both companies are part of the estate of Jamaluddin,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah is also embroiled in a civil suit in the Kuala Lumpur Shariah High Court over her share of RM1 billion from her daughter-in-law, Kalsom Ismail

                Ad hoc prosecutor V Sithambaram said Low, Najib’s late principal private secretary Azlin Alias and former SRC International CEO Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil were in charge of making sure there were sufficient funds in Najib’s accounts

                “The former (Ambank) relationship manager (Joanna Yu) said she used BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) to communicate with Jho Low and Nik Faisal on when funds are coming or when the funds in the accounts are low,” he said

                The report revealed that Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi was solely responsible for the RM9 billion LCS scandal, unless there were “hidden hands” behind Zahid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Contractor chose LCS design Can Zahid explain why he failed to prioritise the RMN in choosing the design of the ships and why instead he chose Gowind LCS, overturning his earlier decision in favour of Sigma LCS as recommended by RMN, without first referring to or discussing with RMN as the end-user? Near the tail-end of the report contained a request letter dated July 8, 2010, from then BNS managing director and vice-executive chairperson Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor to Zahid for a letter of intent from the government for the LCS project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I observed the three charges against Ramli had nothing to do with the LCS scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All three charges were before the issue of the LOA (Letter of Award) for the LCS procurement which was issued on Dec 16, 2011
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the three charges against Ramli pre-date the issue of LOA for the LCS procurement, which meant they related to other defence procurement scandals, can MACC explain why after 10 years, the MACC failed to prefer a single charge against anyone for the RM9 billion LCS scandal? Can the MACC say how many people will be charged for the scandal? Additional govt funds Hishamuddin said after the cabinet meeting on Wednesday that the ongoing construction of the first LCS will not involve new allocations from the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When Hishammuddin appeared before the PAC on Jan 25, 2022, he spoke about the “corporate restructuring” of the RM9 billion LCS contract and that the contractor, BNS, will have to deliver two LCS without any new cost to the government

                “Can Zahid explain his silence on his primary role in the RM9 billion LCS scandal, which had exposed his earlier constant denials that he was to be blamed for the RM9 billion LCS scandal as lies?” he asked

            <p>
                The JKSTUPKK report disclosed that Zahid, as defence minister in 2011, had sided with the contractor, Boustead Naval Shipyard (BNS) instead of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN), the end-user for the six LCS ordered by the government

            <p>
                Lim said Zahid owes the public an explanation on why he ignored the RMN’s recommendation for Sigma LCS and instead unilaterally chose to go with the Gowind LCS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim also asked the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission to explain why it has yet to charge anyone directly for the RM9 billion LCS scandal

            <p>
                He also took to task Defence Minister Datuk Hishamuddin Hussein for still keeping quiet about his ministry’s decision to halve the number of LCS that must be completed and delivered to the RMN by the contractor with no additional government funds

            <p>
                Yesterday, Najib explained that he opted to discharge Muhammad Shafee and team after losing both his case and his appeal at the High Court and the Court of Appeal respectively

                The hearing at the country’s supreme court had been scheduled to take place over nine days, from August 15 to August 19, and will resume after this weekend from August 23 to August 26

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 19 — Lawyers have warned that the Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s (DBKL) ban on a popular comedy centre in Kuala Lumpur and its owners from opening any businesses sets a bad precedent that is tantamount to power abuse and infringing the right of life that is guaranteed to all, under the Federal Constitution
            </p>

            <p>
                It is against Article 5 of the Federal Constitution, whereby their right of life is being restricted

            <p>
                The CMS Setis system was compatible with only one of the navy’s equipment and would have become obsolete in between five and 10 years

                Masidi reportedly said there was no problem with the other oil and gas companies operating in Sabah as they had been paying the SST on time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that Sabah would be able to rake in RM1.2 billion annually if all of the firms had paid the SST on time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Masidi who is also state local government and housing minister reportedly said the issue was “being dealt with” by Sabah and Petronas, while the state government would pursue the matter within its legal power
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In July, Masidi told the state assembly that Sabah would cancel the work permits of the two firms if they failed to settle the RM97 million in SST owed to the state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the two companies were issued notices on the overdue SST on June 21, with the amount set to be settled within 30 days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Masidi had also said Sabah collected RM808 million in SST on petroleum products in the first six months of the year

                In calling for the charges to be dropped, the youth wing leaders of PH component parties said the charges were a waste of court resources and that such charges were meant to “intimidate the youth”

            <p>
                Earlier today, Hasbie, Batu PKR youth chief Sabda Suluh Lestari Yahya and student activist Aliff Naif Mohd Fizam, were charged with failing to notify the police five days before staging their gatherings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasbie’s charge was related to an event he had allegedly organised at Masjid Jamek, Kampung Baru on July 1, while Sabda’s charge concerned a protest in front of the Sogo shopping complex on July 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aliff’s charge also involved a protest in front of Sogo on July 23

                Ahmad Maslan noted the Federal Court’s unanimous decision to reject Najib’s bid to add in purported new evidence regarding Mohd Nazlan’s purported conflict of interest, and the MACC investigation paper on the judge having been sent to the Attorney General’s Chambers since May 18 or three months ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the months leading up to Najib’s final SRC appeal hearing at the Federal Court, wild allegations have been made online against Mohd Nazlan in what appears to be mudslinging attempts against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday, the Federal Court’s five-judge panel unanimously rejected Najib’s bid to ultimately seek for a retrial, pointing out that the purported “new” evidence was actually evidence already available before the SRC trial began in 2019 and Mohd Nazlan’s previous Maybank role was already known to Najib’s lawyers back then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Federal Court had also said the purported new oral and documentary evidence which Najib wanted to add to the SRC case were “irrelevant” to the criminal charges against him and failed to show conflict of interest by Mohd Nazlan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Federal Court said the rejection of the application to add evidence to the SRC case would not result in miscarriage of justice, as such evidence was already available at the SRC trial or could have been discovered then through reasonable diligence and were also totally irrelevant to the charges, and as Najib could still challenge the High Court and Court of Appeal judgments in the SRC appeal at the Federal Court
            </p>

                In a statement this afternoon, he said that the report found that LCS subcontractors had paid €43.69 million, equivalent to RM210 million, based on invoices from a French firm

                He said based on the French firm’s financial returns to the French authorities, only €3.53 million (around RM18 million) was collected during that period

            <p>
                RECENTLY, it has been said that a lawyer climbed across balconies into an adjacent unit to record a video of a neighbour bathing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As their toilets were next to each other, Yeo could tell when the victim was in the shower by listening for her voice or the sound of videos playing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the evening of Nov 23, 2020, he deduced that she was bathing and climbed over the parapet and into her balcony to film her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He held his phone outside the shower window but the victim caught a glimpse of the phone before he could start recording
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He later deleted the video

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 18 — Lawyers representing the co-owners of the Crackhouse Comedy Club have demanded that the Kuala Lumpur mayor reverse the ban on the premises and its owners’ freedom to open businesses in Kuala Lumpur, within two days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The letter reportedly said that Crackhouse Comedy Club owners were not officially notified about the revocation of the club’s licence and the blacklisting, adding that they had never been found guilty of any offence that justified the Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s (DBKL) decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                National news agency Bernama yesterday reported Deputy Federal Territories Minister Datuk Seri Jalaluddin Alias as saying that DBKL had blacklisted the owners of the Crackhouse Comedy Club for life, for violating the terms of its licence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jalaluddin said the club’s business was revoked effective July 30 and the names of the club’s owners were blacklisted for life
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the individuals concerned can also no longer obtain a business licence in Kuala Lumpur, even if they were to use a different company name or attempt to run a different business
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 10, Jalaluddin was reported to have said that the premises was operating without the correct licence because it only had a restaurant licence and not an entertainment one

                Singapore High Commissioner Vanu Gopala Menon greeting guest-of-honour Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin at the reception in conjunction with the republic's National Day celebrated on Aug 9

            <p>
                The island state's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon said the pandemic, however, has reinforced how interdependent Singapore and Malaysia have been throughout the challenging times

                An apex court panel comprising Azahar Mohamed, Hasnah Mohammed Hashim and Abu Bakar Jais delivered the decision yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement, the SC said the decision reflected the seriousness of the breaches and reinforced the robustness of its audit oversight board’s (AOB) enforcement framework

            <p>

            <p>
                In addition, AOB imposed fines of RM455,000 on the audit firm and RM88,000 each on Afrizan and Khairul
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the Federal Court decision, the stay on the AOB’s enforcement decisions until the disposal of the leave application to the apex court obtained by the audit firm and its partners at the Court of Appeal on Feb 11 has lapsed

                N Sundra Rajoo said the Federal Court last year had concluded that Thomas had acted in excess of authority in failing to give due regard to his (Sundra’s) immunity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The plaintiff (Sundra) denies that Thomas had properly exercised his discretion under Article 145(3) of the Federal Constitution,” he said in reply to Thomas’ defence filed early this month

                Sundra, in his statement in reply, said Thomas also did not act honestly as he was aware that Sundra enjoyed immunity from prosecution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sundra said by Thomas’s own conduct, he recognised that a waiver had to be given by the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organisation (AALCO) and not Sundra’s successor, the late Vinayak Pradhan

                Acting Perak police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Azizi Mat Aris said the incident was believed to have been triggered by a heated argument between the 69-year-old taxi driver and his 67-year-old brother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The deceased, a former trader, was found covered in blood in the kitchen while the taxi driver's body was found outside the house," he told a press conference near the house on Thursday (Aug 18)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We also found a knife, believed to be the murder weapon, next to the taxi driver," he said, adding that the police were informed of the incident at about 10am Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deputy Comm Azizi said the case was being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code

                PAS veteran leader Mahfodz Mohamed said the proposal should include Bersatu to ensure a comfortable win by the Malay parties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said PAS would have no problem discussing the proposal with Bersatu, as the Muhyiddin Yassin-led party had been expressing its willingness to negotiate

            <p>
                The PAS veteran believed that it was still possible to bring Umno and Bersatu together, adding that there were Umno leaders who wanted to unite

                Hamzah said an earlier meeting between Ismail Sabri Yaakob and several PN leaders was unofficial and leaned more towards casual talk

                “I have asked for a new official date so that the PN representatives can meet with the PM and discuss our requests.” Prior to this, PN treasurer Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar said he and Hamzah had a lunch meeting with Ismail

                The PN representatives previously identified to meet officially with the prime minister were Hamzah, Ahmad, Supreme Council member Takiyuddin Hassan and information chief Azmin Ali

                Thursday, 18 Aug 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A Federal Court panel comprising Tan Sri Azahar Mohamed, Datuk Seri Hasnah Mohammed Hashim and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais delivered the decision on Aug 17, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Federal Court decision reflects the seriousness of the breaches and reinforces the robustness of the SC’s Audit Oversight Board’s (AOB) enforcement framework, the SC said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, the AOB also imposed fines of RM455,000 on AFTAAS, and RM88,000 each on Mohd Afrizan and Khairul, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the Federal Court decision, the stay on the AOB’s enforcement decisions until the disposal of the leave application to the Federal Court obtained by AFTAAS and its partners at the Court of Appeal on Feb 11, 2022, has lapsed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, the sanctions imposed by the AOB in its enforcement decision including the prohibitions shall take effect from Aug 17, 2022

                In a joint statement, the duo also lambasted the delay in declassifying the PH ordered forensic audit, and shared several excerpts from the Proceeding Report (Hansard) of the Public Account Committee (PAC) dated March 8, which they claim provides details of the audit results
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Government Governance, Procurement and Finance Investigation Committee (JKSTUPKK) report was declassified yesterday but the forensic audit report and the former admiral of the Navy Tan Sri Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor's letter of reprimand have not yet been declassified
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, the findings of this forensic audit are also shocking,” they said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former ministers said that on Page 27 of the PAC proceedings report, Prabhat Kumar, the executive director of Alliance Investigative and Forensic Accounting, testified to the PAC that those involved had no intention to deliver the LCS project, but only had intentions to maximise their own gains

            <p>
                On page 22, En Prabhat Kumar says that ‘It is clear that in the case of the LCS programme, Anuar bin Murad sidestepped the authority of all of his subordinates, and acted in a manner as if they were only two persons in the whole organisation’.” “It is an outright conflict of interest whereby Tan Sri Ramli is the chairman of the LCS Steering Committee and CAD, and at the same time also the Managing Director of BHIC,” they said.

                For the record, some GLCs have been set up to meet public needs, and politicians, being representatives of the people, would be in a better position to ensure that those objectives are met

                Hishammuddin said yesterday the ongoing construction of the first LCS (LCS 1), which was to have been delivered to the navy in 2019, will not involve new allocations from the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Lim noted that when Hishammuddin appeared before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Jan 25, he said Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) would have to deliver two LCS without any additional cost to the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Hishammuddin should explain why the defence ministry has reduced from two LCS to one LCS which must be completed and delivered by the contractor with no additional government funds,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his testimony before the PAC, Hishammuddin had said that if the government wanted to proceed with the project, “we cannot put all the money upfront if Boustead doesn’t commit to being able to deliver at least two ships”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the Hansard sighted by FMT, he said that completing the first two LCS “will not affect upfront payment” as they are “still under the contractual amount”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At a defence ministry event, Hishammuddin told reporters that additional allocations for BNS to complete the remaining five LCS would only be considered after completion of LCS 1 in reportedly another two years

                The Human Resources Minister said the scheme to cover homemakers against injuries suffered while tending to their chores would be managed by the Social Security Organisation (Socso)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 26, the Dewan Rakyat passed the Housewives Social Security Bill (HSS), which allows husbands to voluntarily contribute to the scheme for their wives below the age of 55
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if the definition of housewife would be widened to cover husbands who assume the role of homemakers as well, Saravanan said the ministry would need an in-depth study to see the number of house husbands involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No action would be taken against any husband who did not contribute.” However, he noted that husbands who have signed up to contribute and failed to maintain it monthly would be fined RM10,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saravanan also said the amendments passed in the Employment Insurance System Act 2017 (Act 800) and Employees’ Social Security Act 1969 (Act 4) to increase the maximum monthly salary ceiling limit from RM4,000 to RM5,000 would come into effect next month

                In a statement, the federation’s president Datuk Dr Syed Hussain Syed Husman said economic growth in the second half of this year is expected to slow to between 5% and 6%, compared with 8.9% reported in the second quarter

                He added that some employers were already struggling to fully implement the new minimum wage of RM1,500 per month that took effect in May, which was estimated to cost them an additional RM14 billion per year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that employers will find it very difficult to absorb the additional RM110.99 billion cost per year, as supply chain issues from the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war continue to rock the global markets

                Jasin OCPD Deputy Supt Mispani Hamdan said the elderly couple was walking along the street at about 11.30am on Tuesday (Aug 16), when an ongoing car hit them, causing them to be tossed into the air
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DSP Mispani said the driver of the car was heading towards the Jasin market while the couple was walking towards a row of shophouses in the opposite direction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the couple are in stable condition after receiving treatment at Jasin Hospital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DSP Mispani said the driver was shocked that he had unintentionally mowed down his own relatives when he alighted his car to help the victims

                “I am very happy, very proud of Hisyam,” said Zaid, whose law firm is representing Najib in his final appeal to the Federal Court from his conviction and sentence in his SRC International corruption case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I know he is an honest lawyer, and we can tell an honest lawyer from a dishonest one.”  The former law minister was speaking to the press after the apex court dismissed Najib’s application to adduce fresh evidence to prove that trial judge Nazlan Ghazali was under a serious conflict of interest when presiding over the SRC trial two years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zaid also commiserated with the former prime minister on the setback he suffered but vowed to stay the course
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Hisyam told the press of his own dissatisfaction with the apex court’s decision to reject Najib’s motion to adduce further evidence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Unfortunately, the court did not appreciate our arguments.” He also said he was “terribly disappointed and saddened by the stance taken by the Federal Court” in rejecting his legal team’s request to postpone the appeal proper
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the defence team would need to give serious consideration to what to do next

                The statement by the police this evening follows the revelation by the victim, a student at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM), that it had been more than a year since she filed a report about it with the police and the university administration

                Police, he said, had recorded statements from several people based on the police report which the victim had lodged on June 2, 2021

                The victim had alleged that the lecturer had called her at 12.30am on the same date to do a survey about sex and had asked her to join him to indulge in self pleasure
