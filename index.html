                “The report found that the project was not handled efficiently, reflected in the weakness of the EoT (extension of time), maintenance and ICP (industry collaboration programme),” it said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It said weaknesses were also found in the physical security aspect of the building, as well as systems that could pose a risk of physical and system intrusion if not improved immediately

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To overcome the weaknesses raised and to ensure the mistakes are not repeated in the future, the auditor-general proposed that the transport ministry review all the contract terms to ensure that the interests of the government are protected
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It also recommended that the ministry expedite the process of gazetting the new KLATCC as a protected area and protected place so that it is fully protected in line with its vital role in the country’s civil aviation

                In addition, the transport ministry and Technology Depository Agency Bhd, which comes under the finance ministry, must ensure that the ICP’s implementation goes as planned and the objectives are achieved as the government wishes, said the report

                However, the report said the programme, aimed at improving the quality of life for B40 households living in the city, had reached the targeted number of participants

                Bernama reported that the report also said the programme did not achieve its targeted performance, as some participants did not generate sufficient income to rise above the poverty line

                That same agency, it said, failed to carry out repair works approved for 113 participants, while some RM1.08 million was returned to the finance ministry in 2016 following the housing and local government ministry’s failure to implement the programme

                The report also found that 22 local governments had a total of RM4.82 million remaining from the PPKB programme, which was not spent on aiding the urban poor

                It recommended that the housing and local government ministry re-evaluate the eligibility of participants while ensuring no duplication of aid measures, citing Putrajaya’s limited financial resources

                According to a report by The New Zealand Herald, the 46-year-old Malaysian, who now identifies as female, served the entirety of her five-year sentence and continued to deny her offence

                An MACC source said the eight detainees included the CEO of an IT company in his 50s, who allegedly received bribes of between RM800 and RM1,500

                This follows a landmark Federal Court ruling today which found that the state constitution banning party hopping was in line with the Federal Constitution

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The four Penang assemblymen are Dr Afif Bahardin (Seberang Jaya, ex-PKR), Zulkifli Ibrahim (Sg Acheh, ex-PKR), Khaliq Mehtab Mohd Ishaq (Bertam, Bersatu but pro-PN), and Zolkifly Md Lazim (Telok Bahang, Bersatu but pro-PN)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The four Penang assemblymen had previously filed an injunction against the Penang legislature from passing a motion to vacate their seats after they decided to support PN
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The four had filed a suit in trying to stop the four seats from being vacated

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that Kelantan’s state law barring party hopping was illegal as it violated Article 10(1)(c) of the Federal Constitution on freedom of association

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gobind said Syed Saddiq had raised “various defences” to justify a transfer of RM100,000 into his Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) account as well as a RM120,000 deposit into his bank account when the authorities recorded his statements in 2020

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In reply, Asbi said his investigation focused on the transfer of RM100,000 from Syed Saddiq’s Maybank account to his ASB account between June 16 and June 19, 2018

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Sentul OCPD Asst Comm Beh Eng Lai said police managed to track down the man's wife, a 28-year-old Myanmar woman, who came to the police headquarters on Tuesday (Aug 2) to have her statement recorded

                Prior to the tragedy that struck early on Tuesday, someone saw the man carrying a child on his back

                This came after Apandi had reportedly asked, “Where else in this world can a prime minister’s children become millionaires?” Mahathir said his children were not allowed to do any business with the government, let alone join a government party, when he was the prime minister

                Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles was quoted by the Philippine News Agency as saying that the proprietary claim by the heirs was "in the nature of a private claim"

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Marcos Jr's recent statement about the country's territory, Cruz-Angeles explained, also still needs to be clarified

                “The President’s articulation of his statement about not giving up a square inch of territory will have to be reduced into writing and into specifics, after which, we will announce these to you if they are in any way related to the Sabah claim," she said

                However, without knowing the decision of the Madrid Court to cancel Stampa's appointment as an arbitrator, a French arbitration court went ahead with the Sulu descendants' case against Malaysia last September

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Feb 28 this year, the Paris Arbitration Court awarded the Sulu heirs US$14.92bil (RM66.4bil) from Malaysia

                It followed a U.N.-brokered grain and fertiliser export agreement between Moscow and Kyiv last month - a rare diplomatic breakthrough in a drawn-out war of attrition

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                in partnership with Turkey, we had a first ship with the delivery of grain, but it’s still nothing
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Ukraine, one of the world's top grain producers before the war, had to export a minimum 10 million tonnes of grain to urgently help bring down its budget deficit which was running at $5 billion a month
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the grain shipment but also said it was "only a first step"

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the grain deal might offer a way forward out of conflict

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "A first success is the grain deal, perhaps that can be slowly expanded to a ceasefire." Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had also told Schroeder that, in theory, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was ready to be used to help increase gas supplies to Europe

                Future-proof health financing options will be included in the Health White Paper that is to be presented by year end, says Khairy Jamaluddin

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 – Malaysia’s public health care system, which charges RM1 and RM5 for outpatient and specialist care respectively in Ministry of Health (MOH) facilities, is unsustainable, Khairy Jamaluddin said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The government is aware that the existing public health financing model is not sustainable and will put additional pressure on the federal expenditure
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As such, the government is currently studying various future-proof health financing options to strengthen the country’s health care system as a whole so that health services are more equitable, have high standards, easily accessible at a reasonable cost, and are sustainable in the long run
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairy said the government will use a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to ensure that the people’s health interests are protected in the implementation of any health financing system in the future

                Kim, 36, was fined RM15,000 and sent to Kluang Prison starting June 22 after the court found him guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                India fulfils two-thirds of its vegetable oil demand through imports of around 14 million tonnes annually, including around 8.5 million tonnes of palm oil
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Even if Telangana manages to grow oil palm on only 1 million acres and produces 2 million tonnes of palm oil, it would be a huge achievement, said Chava Venkateswara Rao of Godrej Agrovet Ltd GODE.NS, the country's biggest palm oil producer
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Until last year, the country was adding around 35,000 acres under oil palm every year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Now, with the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project, we have ample water for oil palm," said farmer Bollampalli Venkateshwar Rao, who planted oil palms on 12 acres
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                Ravi Mathur, who heads the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research (IIOPR), a government-backed body spearheading the oil palm push, said the lift irrigation project has made oil palm planting feasible in areas previously unsuitable for the crop because of water scarcity

                With the rate being restored to 11% after having been cut to 9% in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Universiti Putra Malaysia’s (UPM) Rusmawati Said cautioned that if employees are unable to save now, it would get complicated when they were older
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last year, the employee’s share of the statutory contribution rate to EPF was reduced to 9% to boost disposable income during the pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In July, it was set back to 11%
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rusmawati said an individual earning RM2,000 a month would contribute RM220 based on the current rate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “When employees retire, they will have savings that would allow them to get by.” Barjoyai also said employees should not look at the amount deducted for such contributions as a loss as the sum would eventually “return” with interest
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “EPF isn’t a tax but a long-term saving scheme,” he said, adding that this was the best time to revert to the 11% rate to ensure that retirement plans would not be disrupted

                Political analyst Anantha Raman Govindasamy of Universiti Malaysia Sabah told FMT he believed Umno made a top-down rather than a grassroots decision in appointing Tengku Zafrul to the Selangor post
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Tengku Zafrul definitely had some unpopular policies
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                So we just need to wait and see how Umno tries to repackage him, rebuild his image and sell him to the grassroots
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I think he will be repackaged in such a way that he will be seen as one of the clear candidates to help Umno take over Selangor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Umno’s grassroots don’t want another warlord who has too much power,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He dismissed suggestions that the criticism Tengku Zafrul faced over his unpopular policies would cast him in a bad light with the Umno grassroots

                Sheikh Moqhtar Kadir said the PJD Link was merely a rebranding of the Kinrara Damansara Expressway (Kidex) that was cancelled in 2015 and removed from the Selangor State Structural Plan 2035 by the state government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Based on this, why did the ministry not exclude PJD Link from the Malaysia Highway Authority’s Highway Network Development Plan (HNDP) 2030?” said Moqhtar, the chairman of the Coalition Against PJD Link Highway, in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “How was PJD Link given its approval in principle when Kidex was to be removed from the Selangor State Structural Plan 2035?” He noted that menteri besar Amirudin Shari had “confirmed (Kidex’s) rebranding” at a PKR political bureau meeting last September
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Moqhtar said the coalition was seeking Fadillah’s consideration to review the validity of the PJD Link’s concession agreement since the minister had acknowledged the cancellation of Kidex in Parliament in 2016
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                His statement comes a day after Fadillah met with representatives of “Say No To PJD Link”, a group of Selangor residents against the planned highway, to assure them that the project would have to get the state government’s nod, and approval by the works ministry, before going ahead

                The project was approved in principle by the Cabinet on Nov 12, 2017, and by the Selangor government on Sept 3, 2020

                It’s not practical when you consider that construction costs have gone up and developers are having a hard time meeting the demand for affordable housing.” Juwairiya was commenting on Selangor MCA chief Ng Chok Sin’s remarks that the price of affordable homes in Selangor should be reduced by half if BN wrests control of the state in GE15

                For instance, Ng said, affordable homes built under a state government programme could be reduced in price from RM250,000 to RM125,000

                Deputy defence minister Ikmal Hisham Abdul Aziz said the ministry had completed all tender evaluation processes to acquire the unmanned aircraft for use by the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) to strengthen its defence capability
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the ministry’s procurement board had certified the selected tenderers and submitted them to the finance ministry on July 7
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The maintenance ecosystem would be implemented after the expiry of the warranty period from the original equipment manufacturer, based on the maintenance concept determined by RMAF
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ahmad Tarmizi had asked about the status of the tender, procurement, maintenance for the MALE UAS aircraft during the question-and-answer session

                In reply to a supplementary question from Awang Husaini Sahari (PH-Putatan) regarding the objective of acquiring the system, Ikmal said the aircraft would carry out intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions for the armed forces

                Labuan domestic trade and consumer affairs department director Junaidah Arbain said the sugar was imported by three wholesalers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “We hope they are able to resolve the issues as soon as possible so that the sugar can be released,” she said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Junaidah said the longer the wholesalers let the sugar lie stranded at the port, the more charges they would have to bear

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She said Labuan had been facing a shortage of sugar supply since late last year with supermarkets and hypermarkets having to place a limit of one packet per customer

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She said the ministry had approved nine wholesalers here to import sugar from two main suppliers in the peninsula
