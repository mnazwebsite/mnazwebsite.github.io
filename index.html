                He said the tripartite agreement involving the then Sultan of Sulu, Sultan Jamal Al Alam, the then maharaja of Sabah, Baron de Overbeck, and British North Borneo Company’s Alfred Dent was written in Malay using the Jawi script
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The agreement has no reference for parties to resolve any dispute of North Borneo (Sabah) by way of arbitration,” he told FMT
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the 2019 letter to the lawyer of the Sulu heirs sighted by FMT, Thomas attached a copy of a 1939 judgment by the North Borneo High Court and said Malaysia did not dispute the identity of the individuals and their right to be paid
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Firoz said Malaysia had no choice but to set aside the award but it was going to be a “challenging” task because of Article 5 of the New York Convention
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under the agreement, Jamal ceded sovereignty over large parts of Sabah to Dent and Overbeck, who agreed that they and their future heirs were to pay the heirs of the sultan 5,000 Mexican dollars annually
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Although Malaysia took over these payments when it became the successor of the agreement following Sabah’s independence and the formation of Malaysia in 1963, these payments – equivalent to RM5,300 a year – ceased in 2013 after an incursion by armed men into Lahad Datu, along the eastern coast of Sabah

                Singaporean Pi Jiapeng and his wife thai national Pansuk Siriwipa have allegedly failed to deliver luxury goods worth about S$32 million (RM103 million) to customers and fled Singapore in a container compartment of a lorry on July 4

                It was responding to queries from The Straits Times on Saturday (July 23) about how the couple allegedly involved in a luxury goods scam managed to flee Singapore early this month

                According to the Bagan MP, the number of road deaths caused by rempit is much higher than of those caused by drunk drivers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim said there were five road deaths and two injuries in Penang recently that were caused by rempit racers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also noted that a former board member of the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research Shahrim Tamrin had highlighted police data showing 12,000 road fatalities caused by rempit since 2009
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Unfortunately, Wee does not appear to have the same political will to overcome the dangerous mat rempit compared to dealing with drunk driving,” Lim said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former finance minister suggested that similar punishments for drink driving be imposed against rempit who cause road deaths

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that figures from the World Health Organisation and a global road safety report from December 2018 showed under 1 per cent of road deaths in Malaysia were related to alcohol

                Lim said Wee Ka Siong is unfit to be the transport minister if he cannot see the huge disparity between fatal accidents caused by Mat Rempit racing illegally on our highways and deaths caused by drunk driving

                The Sulu heirs, it is reported, might be eyeing the takeover of other 167 global assets of Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The trial in the French court might be crucial to determine whether there is light at the end of the tunnel over Malaysia’s dispute with the Sulu heirs, in other words, the Philippines
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Political agenda It is clear that Najib has his own political agenda in shifting the blame for the ongoing dispute with the Sulu heirs on the former Harapan government and on the former AG Thomas
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Whether the letter written by Thomas while in office to the Sulu heirs in offering a new compensation of RM48,000 was prejudicial or not is not the question, but why was it written and whether he disagreed with the earlier decision of not paying the Sulu heirs
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is clear that the Najib government was responsible for the present imbroglio with the Sulu heirs

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Friday, a source with the Thai police said Teow was being held at a police station in Sadao for alleged money laundering

                He was arrested in a raid conducted by a team led by Thai national police assistant chief Pol Lt-Gen Surachate Hakparn, which led to the police searching Teow’s MBI Group’s office in Sadao at the Thai-Malaysian border

                An investigation led by Surachate discovered their links to Teow, police said on Friday

                Teow was arrested in 2017 in Malaysia on a charge of drug dealing, but he fled to Songkhla and later managed to escape prosecution

                About Us Advertise PARIS, July 24 — Iran yesterday carried out its first public execution in over two years, an NGO said, denouncing the practice as "medieval" as concern grows over rising repression in the Islamic republic

                Iman Sabzikar, who had been convicted over the murder of a police officer in February 2022 in the southern city of Shiraz, was hanged in the early morning at the scene of the crime, Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It said that Iranian state media has reported on the public execution taking place and that the convict had been identified as Sabzikar, whose sentence of being hanged in public had been confirmed by the supreme court earlier this month
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "The resumption of this brutal punishment in public is intended to scare and intimidate people from protesting," said IHR's director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam

                Executions in Iran usually take place within the walls of prison and activists say public executions are used as a deterrent, especially when the crime concerns the killing of a member of the security forces

                It is learnt that in 2009, the bank had received a working paper for an application from a company listed on Bursa Malaysia for a loan of RM294mil
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The loan application was for the company – of which one of the three suspects was a member of the board of directors – to take over the shares of another public-listed company
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The working paper was prepared by a company owned by another suspect in this case
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sources said after going through the application, the bank approved the loan and at that point in time, the bank subsidiary CEO – said to be the main suspect in this case – was the person responsible for evaluating the application

                It was reported that the Department of Orang Asli Development (Jakoa) is expected to begin a study on amendments to the Act this year to provide better protection for the community

                “It’s been a 20-year wait and we should move forward.”  Nicholas suggested that instead of amending the existing Act alone, the government should consider developing several legislation in relation to the Orang Asli

                Orang Asli Development Cooperative founder Ramesh Arumugam Chettiar said there was no need for another study on the Act, adding that immediate amendments should be implemented

                But the High Court on May 23 this year dismissed Apandi’s defamation lawsuit, after having found that the evidence produced in court — including Apandi’s own testimony — showed Lim as having successfully proven his defences
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court expressed its disdain for what it described as Apandi’s own contradictions in his testimony in court as his own witness during the hearing of the defamation lawsuit, his “evasiveness and outright untruth”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On this point alone, the judge said it was glaringly obvious that Lim’s remark on Apandi is justified
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court said it was suspicious on how Apandi had “hastily adopted the donation narrative” when he himself as the attorney general “does not even care to remember or to know the name of the fabled donor (which is obviously a critical information for the investigation)”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court ultimately concluded that Lim has proven the full defence of justification
            </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Justice Lim Hock Leng acquitted Indonesian worker Sabri Umar on Friday (July 22) following his appeal against his conviction by the Sessions Court on April 19 this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court judgment came after lawyers from legal firm Jussary Kang, representing the Indonesia Consulate Tawau branch, took up Sabri's case for wrongful imprisonment
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court was told that Sabri, who was unrepresented when he was charged at the Tawau Sessions Court, had pleaded guilty in the mistaken belief that he would be deported in May 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They argued that though he pleaded guilty, the Sessions Court did not check that Sabri had a valid passport when pleading for the High Court to set aside the conviction
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court was told that Sabri was caned on June 23 despite his case being appealed since April 21, this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sabri's case drew strong condemnation from human rights groups after he was caned at the Tawau prison despite his appeal against the conviction yet to be heard by the Tawau High Court

                This involves the sovereignty of the government, and the rakyat of Malaysia deserves an explanation,” wrote Apandi
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The question was one out of four posed by Apandi in his post - the latest saga in an ongoing feud between him and Dr Mahathir
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Apandi also asked Dr Mahathir to explain why Tommy Thomas - who was the AG during Dr Mahathir’s prime ministership - was ordered to write a letter to the Sulu Sultanate claimants in 2019
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This is an acknowledgement that Dr Mahathir’s actions were arbitrary and are procedurally and legally wrong,” said Apandi
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Apandi’s service as AG was terminated shortly after Dr Mahathir became prime minister following the 2018 general election
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his fourth question to Dr Mahathir, Apandi asked “where else in this world is there a prime minister whose children are millionaires?” Dr Mahathir and Apandi’s spats have been going on in the past few weeks, with both issuing statements questioning each other on issues related to Batu Puteh, the Sulu claim and 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Thursday, Azam questioned the reliability of Transparency International’s (TI) Corruption Perception Index (CPI)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that several indicators in the survey, such as human rights and business ethics, were not related to corruption

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Labelling Azam’s remarks as a “lapse of judgement”, C4 called for the MACC chief commissioner to better explain the CPI’s value rather than discredit it
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                C4 said it was wrong for Azam to state that human rights and business ethics had little to do with corruption

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “He should know that the perception of corruption arising from a lack of government transparency or conflict of interest is problematic in nature and does not need evidence to prove so,” it added

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a separate statement, DAP veteran Lim Kit Siang called for a new MACC chief to prevent the country from falling any further in the CPI

                “Yet, he (Mahathir) is now blaming the Barisan Nasional (BN) administration for stopping the payment to the heirs of the Sulu sultanate,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the report, Mahathir said the payment should be stopped because the alleged Sulu descendants had allegedly breached the terms

                However, the government obtained a stay order against the enforcement of the French arbitration court ruling that ordered it to pay US$14.92 billion to the heirs of the sultanate

                According to the letter, Thomas offered to settle the multi-billion dollar claim with a RM48,000 compensation payment

                Why are you viewing Seputeh MP Teresa Kok’s call for racial balance in the civil service as a personal affront to you? As Cuepac's president, you should be concerned with the working conditions and well-being of those under your concern, not consider things from a racial perspective and be another useless politician

                Thus the contents of Thomas’ letter were clearly “relied upon” by the Sulu claimants in their arbitration claim against Malaysia in Madrid and Paris, said Chin

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said that Thomas should have taken steps to defend Malaysia against the Spanish arbitration claim, instead of merely not recognising the Spanish court’s jurisdiction to arbitrate the Sulu claim

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Resorting to copying letters to the Spanish arbitrator was an admission that Malaysia was aware of the case, said Chin

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also questioned if Thomas had consulted the then de facto law minister Liew Vui Keong before responding to the Sulu heir’s letter of demand

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                He said preliminary investigation found that the cement tanker, which was heading south, suddenly crashed into the rear of the Toyota Hilux, and the impact caused the latter to hit into the rear of the Audi car

                After the clinic, the court visited the Ramakrishna Ashram on Scotland Road, where Anna was last seen alighting from the same Uber vehicle

                The site visit was supposed to end then, but on the insistence of the Jenkins’ family lawyer, Raveentharan Subramaniam, the court headed to Batu Gantong, where Jenkin’s skeletal remains were found three years after her disappearance

                Raveentharan then explained to the coroner that it was impossible for Anna to have walked from the Ashram to this point, as it was almost 2km away, and the access road was on a terraced hill

                In his statement of defence in a suit filed against him by Shahril, Rafizi said he raised the issue as Shahril's remuneration when he served as the CEO did not commensurate with Sapura's financial performance
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                MSWG, meanwhile, raised the issue of Shahril's remuneration package being excessive which had been brought up at a previous Sapura AGM
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The MSWG had further condemned Sapura's corporate governance mechanism at the 2018 AGM and the payment of the intellectual property rights, trademark and branding fee to Sapura Holdings Sdn Bhd in which Shahril holds a direct shareholding,” Rafizi added in his defence statement
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Shahril, who is presently the president and Group CEO of Sapura Group, had filed the suit via Messrs Zul Rafique & Partners following Rafizi's statement questioning the remuneration and the move to inject more public funds to bail out the company
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former PKR lawmaker was of the view that public funds should not be used to bail the company out

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said that between 2009 and 2021, Sapura had paid Shahril approximately RM1.1 billion in total remuneration, of which RM980 million to RM990 million was paid during Najib's tenure as the Prime Minister from 2009 to 2018

                The ringgit was pegged to the US dollar from 1998 to 2005, and Bank Negara Malaysia had on July 21, 2005 shifted to a managed float system for the ringgit

                On May 13, however, Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said it would not be in Malaysia's best interest to peg the ringgit as it would carry substantial risks such as having to mirror the monetary policy of the country that the ringgit is pegged against, and being very costly as it would take up a sizeable amount of reserves

                About Us Advertise SIBU, July 22 — Sarawak Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg urged the federal government tonight to swiftly honour the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) in its entirety, in the spirit of Keluarga Malaysia

                “What our Sarawak leaders had included then as provisions in the agreement as part of Malaysia were what they considered as necessary to protect the rights and interests of Sarawak and its people during their time, during our time and after our time,” he said at the Sarawak Day celebration at the Indoor Stadium here

                Prominent Sabah lawyer Roger Chin said the contents of Thomas's letter were obviously "relied upon" by the Sulu claimants in their Madrid and Paris arbitration claims against Malaysia

                "That was an admission (owing money)..

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                By ignoring it, it doesn't make it disappear and by copying the letter, it acknowledges you know about it

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "So you basically say, you know the matter, and then say you will ignore it and let the court do what it wants?" he said, noting that some other lawyers might have taken the same approach as Thomas

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yong, a lawyer and Sabah Progressive Party president, said Thomas essentially admitted that the 1878 Sulu grant was still valid and Malaysia had been "legally erroneous in stopping the payments"
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yong also noted that Thomas appeared to lack awareness of the Sulu claim issues and pointed out that during the Sabah Law Society (SLS) webinar in April, Thomas had admitted that he was not aware of the historical and current facts

                A source told FMT that Santhara submitted a letter to Bersatu secretary-general Hamzah Zainudin last week on his departure from the party

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The source said Santhara did not see any future for non-Bumiputera MPs in the Muhyiddin Yassin-led party

                Bersatu is trying to persuade him to change his mind, but he has said he will be going ahead with it.”  Santhara was the first non-Bumiputera MP to join Bersatu in August 2020

                In January this year, Santhara said he was staying on with Bersatu despite receiving numerous offers to join other parties in the next general election (GE15)
