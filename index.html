                The family of Kim Shih Keat, 36, have called for an inquest to be held and for a joint investigation by the police, the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission and the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam)
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh said it was important for the police to release the post-mortem report as the family could look into the possibility of an inquest
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ramkarpal said he would ask the Johor prosecution director to look into the case, especially the post-mortem report, as the cause of death is still unknown

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                His brother, Shih Hoe, said the family was told that Kim had died in hospital on June 28 after being found unconscious in Kluang prison hours before his release

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                He said the tripartite agreement involving the then Sultan of Sulu, Sultan Jamal Al Alam, the then maharaja of Sabah, Baron de Overbeck, and British North Borneo Company’s Alfred Dent was written in Malay using the Jawi script
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The agreement has no reference for parties to resolve any dispute of North Borneo (Sabah) by way of arbitration,” he told FMT
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the 2019 letter to the lawyer of the Sulu heirs sighted by FMT, Thomas attached a copy of a 1939 judgment by the North Borneo High Court and said Malaysia did not dispute the identity of the individuals and their right to be paid

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Firoz said Malaysia had no choice but to set aside the award but it was going to be a “challenging” task because of Article 5 of the New York Convention
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under the agreement, Jamal ceded sovereignty over large parts of Sabah to Dent and Overbeck, who agreed that they and their future heirs were to pay the heirs of the sultan 5,000 Mexican dollars annually
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Although Malaysia took over these payments when it became the successor of the agreement following Sabah’s independence and the formation of Malaysia in 1963, these payments – equivalent to RM5,300 a year – ceased in 2013 after an incursion by armed men into Lahad Datu, along the eastern coast of Sabah

                Singaporean Pi Jiapeng and his wife thai national Pansuk Siriwipa have allegedly failed to deliver luxury goods worth about S$32 million (RM103 million) to customers and fled Singapore in a container compartment of a lorry on July 4

                It was responding to queries from The Straits Times on Saturday (July 23) about how the couple allegedly involved in a luxury goods scam managed to flee Singapore early this month

                According to the Bagan MP, the number of road deaths caused by rempit is much higher than of those caused by drunk drivers

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim said there were five road deaths and two injuries in Penang recently that were caused by rempit racers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also noted that a former board member of the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research Shahrim Tamrin had highlighted police data showing 12,000 road fatalities caused by rempit since 2009
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Unfortunately, Wee does not appear to have the same political will to overcome the dangerous mat rempit compared to dealing with drunk driving,” Lim said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former finance minister suggested that similar punishments for drink driving be imposed against rempit who cause road deaths
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that figures from the World Health Organisation and a global road safety report from December 2018 showed under 1 per cent of road deaths in Malaysia were related to alcohol

                The Sulu heirs, it is reported, might be eyeing the takeover of other 167 global assets of Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The trial in the French court might be crucial to determine whether there is light at the end of the tunnel over Malaysia’s dispute with the Sulu heirs, in other words, the Philippines

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Political agenda It is clear that Najib has his own political agenda in shifting the blame for the ongoing dispute with the Sulu heirs on the former Harapan government and on the former AG Thomas

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Whether the letter written by Thomas while in office to the Sulu heirs in offering a new compensation of RM48,000 was prejudicial or not is not the question, but why was it written and whether he disagreed with the earlier decision of not paying the Sulu heirs
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is clear that the Najib government was responsible for the present imbroglio with the Sulu heirs

                About Us Advertise PARIS, July 24 — Iran yesterday carried out its first public execution in over two years, an NGO said, denouncing the practice as "medieval" as concern grows over rising repression in the Islamic republic

                Iman Sabzikar, who had been convicted over the murder of a police officer in February 2022 in the southern city of Shiraz, was hanged in the early morning at the scene of the crime, Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It said that Iranian state media has reported on the public execution taking place and that the convict had been identified as Sabzikar, whose sentence of being hanged in public had been confirmed by the supreme court earlier this month
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                "The resumption of this brutal punishment in public is intended to scare and intimidate people from protesting," said IHR's director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam

                Executions in Iran usually take place within the walls of prison and activists say public executions are used as a deterrent, especially when the crime concerns the killing of a member of the security forces

                Dubbed “Jho Low 2” in Malaysia, it is said that Teow is a wanted man in Malaysia, China and Thailand

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Friday, a source with the Thai police said Teow was being held at a police station in Sadao for alleged money laundering

                He was arrested in a raid conducted by a team led by Thai national police assistant chief Pol Lt-Gen Surachate Hakparn, which led to the police searching Teow’s MBI Group’s office in Sadao at the Thai-Malaysian border

                Teow was arrested in 2017 in Malaysia on a charge of drug dealing, but he fled to Songkhla and later managed to escape prosecution

                It was reported that the Department of Orang Asli Development (Jakoa) is expected to begin a study on amendments to the Act this year to provide better protection for the community

                “It’s been a 20-year wait and we should move forward.”  Nicholas suggested that instead of amending the existing Act alone, the government should consider developing several legislation in relation to the Orang Asli

                Justice Lim Hock Leng acquitted Indonesian worker Sabri Umar on Friday (July 22) following his appeal against his conviction by the Sessions Court on April 19 this year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court judgment came after lawyers from legal firm Jussary Kang, representing the Indonesia Consulate Tawau branch, took up Sabri's case for wrongful imprisonment
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court was told that Sabri, who was unrepresented when he was charged at the Tawau Sessions Court, had pleaded guilty in the mistaken belief that he would be deported in May 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They argued that though he pleaded guilty, the Sessions Court did not check that Sabri had a valid passport when pleading for the High Court to set aside the conviction
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court was told that Sabri was caned on June 23 despite his case being appealed since April 21, this year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sabri's case drew strong condemnation from human rights groups after he was caned at the Tawau prison despite his appeal against the conviction yet to be heard by the Tawau High Court

                About Us Advertise SIBU, July 22 — Sarawak Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg urged the federal government tonight to swiftly honour the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) in its entirety, in the spirit of Keluarga Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “What our Sarawak leaders had included then as provisions in the agreement as part of Malaysia were what they considered as necessary to protect the rights and interests of Sarawak and its people during their time, during our time and after our time,” he said at the Sarawak Day celebration at the Indoor Stadium here

                He noted that the events leading to the surrender of power of self-government to Sarawak on July 22, 1963 followed by the formation of Malaysia on September 16, 1963 based on MA63

                He said agreement signed by Britain, Federation of Malaya, Sarawak, Sabah (North Borneo) and Singapore was a foundation on the formation of Malaysia which was recognised by the United Nations
