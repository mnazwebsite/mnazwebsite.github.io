                Royal Malaysia Police secretary Deputy Comm Datuk Noorsiah Mohd Saaduddin said four investigation papers in Selangor and two investigation papers in Negri Sembilan have been referred to the deputy public prosecutor with the recommendation to prosecute under Section 14(a) of the Sexual Offence against Children Act 2017
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Selangor police chief Comm Datuk Arjunaidi Mohamed said that police reports were lodged against the speaker by four individuals, aged 17 and 18, and they claimed that they were victims of sexual abuse with the perpetrator being a known motivational speaker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After getting to know them, the suspect would then sexually abuse the victims," he said
            </p>

            <p>
                Ahmad said all preparations have been completed and what’s left is to update the machinery and portfolios at the polling district centres (PDM)

                About Us Advertise PONTIAN, Sept 18 — Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan said he is confident that the 15th general election would be held this year which has three months to go

            <p>
                Ahmad said he wanted the party machinery to respond to the call of Umno’s top leadership that the party must dominate the virtual campaign and cyber war, as a lesson learned from GE14 when it was defeated due to online allegations and slander
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad said all preparations have been completed and what’s left is to update the machinery and portfolios at the polling district centres (PDM)

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 18 — PKR deputy president Rafizi Ramli said today Pakatan Harapan’s (PH) chances of getting the 30 per cent Malay vote needed to put the coalition back in power at the 15th general election is “doable”, as the party begins to ramp up its machinery for the looming national polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi claimed the shift in Malay voter sentiment had already happened between July and August, but on a smaller scale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between July and August, there was a 3 to 4 per cent swing in Malay votes towards Pakatan,” said the PKR deputy president
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you see this trend of 1 to 2 per cent swing every month towards Pakatan and PKR, even if there is a one-on-one fight, if Pakatan can get up to 30 per cent of the Malay vote and voter turnout is 75 per cent, PH strategists believe its maiden national win in the watershed 2018 general election was made possible by a 30 per cent Malay vote swing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Eighty per cent of the respondents said they are very dissatisfied with the state of the economy,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That way canvassing would be far cheaper since campaign workers can filter out voters that aren’t likely to vote for Pakatan and focus only on those who might, Rafizi asserted, ultimately reducing dependency on funding
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 18 — PKR deputy president Rafizi Ramli said today Pakatan Harapan’s (PH) chances of getting the 30 per cent Malay vote needed to put the coalition back in power at the 15th general election is “doable”, as the party begins to ramp up its machinery for the looming national polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi claimed the shift in Malay voter sentiment had already happened between July and August, but on a smaller scale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between July and August, there was a 3 to 4 per cent swing in Malay votes towards Pakatan,” said the PKR deputy president
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you see this trend of 1 to 2 per cent swing every month towards Pakatan and PKR, even if there is a one-on-one fight, if Pakatan can get up to 30 per cent of the Malay vote and voter turnout is 75 per cent, PH strategists believe its maiden national win in the watershed 2018 general election was made possible by a 30 per cent Malay vote swing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Eighty per cent of the respondents said they are very dissatisfied with the state of the economy,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That way canvassing would be far cheaper since campaign workers can filter out voters that aren’t likely to vote for Pakatan and focus only on those who might, Rafizi asserted, ultimately reducing dependency on funding
            </p>

                Previously, we (Pakatan Harapan and PKR) have failed to convince fence-sitters to go out and vote during the state election

            <p>

                'Arsenal fans will go away from here tonight thinking "we've been bullied"', was Gary Neville's assessment of Arsenal's 2-0 defeat to Brentford on the opening night of the 2021-22 campaign.  Mikel Arteta's side travelled to Thomas Frank's then-newly promoted Brentford team and were taught a comprehensive lesson of preparation and application.  Arsenal return to Brentford 13 months on from their chastening defeat at the same ground One game into the new season, knives, in some quarters, were already out for the Spaniard and two subsequent defeats at an aggregate score of 7-0 did not do much to stem the tide.  Following that dreadful start that left Arsenal at the foot of the league table questioning where their next win could come from, they have improved markedly.  It was only a late season blip that saw them miss out on the Champions League after putting themselves in the box seat with weeks of the season to go with Arteta's young side emerging from the canvass of their poor start to challenge towards the upper echelons of the league.  Not many, had you asked them on August 13 2021, would have given Arsenal much of a chance of sitting pretty at the top of the league a year later

            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp is a huge admirer of Bellingham and claimed that the only problem (last window) was that the player was not available

                The Telegraph claim since leaving Birmingham City for £20.7million, the teenage sensation’s market value has soared, he could be available next summer and sources suggest that Liverpool are expected to make their move

                It will be fair to say that the Reds must ensure CL qualification for next season to have any chance of signing Jude Bellingham next summer

                The hosts were not intimidated by Bayern at any stage and their seven shots on goal were almost double Bayern's total in the opening half

            <p>
                It was the first time in 87 matches that Bayern had failed to score in a league game and the first time in 20 years that the team had gone four league games without a win

                More info Manchester United are, according to reports, looking to sign a right-back, central midfielder and striker as part of the next phase of Erik ten Hag’s rebuild
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A right-back is being eyed to provide competition for Diogo Dalot, who is now firmly above Aaron Wan-Bissaka when it comes to Ten Hag’s pecking order
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And it’s now damning that, just a year after his departure, United are now planing on doing the same with Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United chief John Murtough told Ten Hag to give Wan-Bissaka a chance back in the summer, with the club reluctant to take a loss on the right-back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even under Ten Hag, who he previously played under at Ajax, the 25-year-old has been marginalised - though injuries have admittedly played a role as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So that’s another transfer error from Solskjaer that’s now being exposed, and that Ten Hag will be looking to rectify when the transfer window reopens in January

                More info Manchester United are, according to reports, looking to sign a right-back, central midfielder and striker as part of the next phase of Erik ten Hag’s rebuild
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A right-back is being eyed to provide competition for Diogo Dalot, who is now firmly above Aaron Wan-Bissaka when it comes to Ten Hag’s pecking order
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And it’s now damning that, just a year after his departure, United are now planing on doing the same with Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United chief John Murtough told Ten Hag to give Wan-Bissaka a chance back in the summer, with the club reluctant to take a loss on the right-back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even under Ten Hag, who he previously played under at Ajax, the 25-year-old has been marginalised - though injuries have admittedly played a role as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So that’s another transfer error from Solskjaer that’s now being exposed, and that Ten Hag will be looking to rectify when the transfer window reopens in January
            </p>

                As with the first half of September, the prevailing south-west monsoon conditions are predicted to persist over Singapore and the surrounding region

                Low-level winds are expected to continue blowing from the south-east or south-west, said the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) on Friday

                The southwest monsoon over the Andaman Sea, Thailand and the Gulf of Thailand will also strengthen during the period

            <p>
                The department also said waves in upper Andaman and upper Gulf will be 1 to 2 metres high and higher during thundershowers

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri was addressing at the opening of the 19th China-Asean Expo (Caexpo) in Nanning city of China’s southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on Friday (Sept 16)

            <p>
                "In this regard, I highly hope that China can join its Asean friends in taking steps to re-open up its borders in the near future," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia has been chosen as the Country of Honour at the expo, which is held from Sept 16 to 19

            <p>
                The number of Malaysian exhibitors has dropped from more than 170 before Covid-19, to 58 in 2020 and 2021 due to the strict pandemic control and prevention policy imposed in China

                Admittedly Thiago’s impressive return from injury against Ajax, Henderson’s expected return after the September injury break and the prospect of Keita and Oxlade-Chamberlain, if not Jones as well, returning next month could ensure Arthur’s opportunities remain limited

                It is plausible a move could be made for a target in January as a result, but it would be premature to suggest any such move would be at the expense of Arthur

                With time on the training pitch and recovery time limited too, injuries will follow and Klopp will need everybody available to him

                About Us Advertise JOHOR BARU, Sept 16 — Outspoken Johor Umno leader Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed today claimed that there are several dissident Umno leaders involved in a covert effort to form a ‘Trans-Borneo’ political pact to take over the country after the 15th general election (GE15)
            </p>

                Nur Jazlan, who is also the Pulai Umno division chief, pointed out that the dissident faction is prepared to betray their own party’s struggle to continue their position and privileges in Putrajaya

                Ronaldo appeared to slap a phone out of the hands of a 14-year-old boy at Everton last season The child's mother declined the opportunity to meet Ronaldo and branded him 'arrogant' after speaking to the Portuguese international on the phone.  Nevertheless, Ronaldo will have been pleased to have scored his first goal of the 2022-2023 campaign during United's triumph over Sheriff.  The 37-year-old scored from the penalty spot after Diogo Dalot was fouled by Patrick Kpozo inside the box.  Ronaldo looked nervous before stepping up to take the penalty but fired the ball straight down the middle to register his 699th career club goal.  Ronaldo previously wore shin pads with a picture of his face next to the crest of the Portugal national team

                The Subaru Crosstrek name is of course not new to the model, as it was called by either the Crosstrek or XV names with previous generation cars, but Subaru has now decided on Crosstrek as a single name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Subaru says the new Crosstrek gets a new seat design with better pelvis support, which is said to prevent vehicle swaying motions from being transferred to the head

            <p>
                This new Crosstrek could have fixed that shortcoming but it looks about the same, but I’ll wait for the actual car to be here to confirm that

                The Subaru Crosstrek name is of course not new to the model, as it was called by either the Crosstrek or XV names with previous generation cars, but Subaru has now decided on Crosstrek as a single name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Subaru says the new Crosstrek gets a new seat design with better pelvis support, which is said to prevent vehicle swaying motions from being transferred to the head
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Civic FE hatchback ketam rear Does it look like Ketam tailights Where you get that from? Is Subaru promoting the new Ironman movie?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This suv will be slow Not as powerful as turbo but wait till new crosstrek will come here, then you will realize
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This new Crosstrek could have fixed that shortcoming but it looks about the same, but I’ll wait for the actual car to be here to confirm that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What an ugly design!!!  What is Subaru thinking?!  Take a cue from Mazda’s cabin

                The first time was on Dec 18, 2020, when the Sessions Court ordered his release after finding the prosecution had failed to raise a prima facie case against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution then appealed to the High Court and last March 24, it ordered the case to be reverted back to the Sessions Court for Sabudin to enter his defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At Thursday’s (Sept 15) proceeding, Judge Rozina Ayob acquitted and discharged Sabudin of the two charges after finding that the prosecution had failed to prove the case

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 15 — A company controlled by Malaysian tycoon and Genting chairman Lim Kok Thay has put in a bid for a casino licence in Macau, a surprise challenge to the decades-long oligopoly of the six incumbent operators
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A GMM representative told reporters that the bid was submitted on behalf of leisure and entertainment firm Genting, according to Macao Daily
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shares in Macau casino operators fell 2 per cent in Thursday morning trading in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg Intelligence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For decades, Macau’s gaming industry was run as a monopoly by casino magnate Stanley Ho, but in 2002 more operators were brought in and issued 20-year concessions as part of a liberalisation effort
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a research note, JPMorgan Chase analysts argued it was “unlikely” for Macau to prefer a new foreign operator over incumbents who have a track record in investment and local employment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January, Genting’s Hong Kong cruise ship operator filed for liquidation after its shipyard in Germany went bankrupt

                A GMM representative told reporters that the bid was submitted on behalf of leisure and entertainment firm Genting, according to Macao Daily

                Shares in Macau casino operators fell 2 per cent in Thursday morning trading in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg Intelligence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For decades, Macau’s gaming industry was run as a monopoly by casino magnate Stanley Ho, but in 2002 more operators were brought in and issued 20-year concessions as part of a liberalisation effort
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In January, Genting’s Hong Kong cruise ship operator filed for liquidation after its shipyard in Germany went bankrupt

                Her post prompted a heated reaction, with many shocked to see MSG included in the KFC seasoning

                “Some of our food does contain MSG but rest assured, it’s only present at levels that are safe for the general population,” the fast food giant states on its website

            <p>
                Food safety authority Food Standards Australia New Zealand has confirmed that MSG is safe for people to consume
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) reviewed the safety of MSG in 2003 concluding ‘there is no convincing evidence that MSG is a significant factor in causing systemic reactions resulting in severe illness or mortality’,” it states on its website

                But Arsenal must make securing his future a priority over the summer, as his impact highlighted how important he is to the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Gunners may get to a helping hand from Kylian Mbappe in Edu’s attempts to keep Saka at the club

            <p>
                This comes after a clause in Mbappe's contract has reportedly been revealed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to  90min, Real Madrid and Manchester City are among the sides monitoring Saka, which Arsenal and the player are aware of, but there's growing confidence that fresh terms will be signed off before the new year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to L'Equipe, however, that three-year deal is in actuality a two-year contract with an extra optional year - one that can only be triggered with the consent of the player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal are said to be pushing hard to tie Saka down to a new long-term contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Mbappe's contract situation could hand Edu a major boost in keeping the Englishman at the club

                But Arsenal must make securing his future a priority over the summer, as his impact highlighted how important he is to the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Gunners may get to a helping hand from Kylian Mbappe in Edu’s attempts to keep Saka at the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This comes after a clause in Mbappe's contract has reportedly been revealed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to  90min, Real Madrid and Manchester City are among the sides monitoring Saka, which Arsenal and the player are aware of, but there's growing confidence that fresh terms will be signed off before the new year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to L'Equipe, however, that three-year deal is in actuality a two-year contract with an extra optional year - one that can only be triggered with the consent of the player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal are said to be pushing hard to tie Saka down to a new long-term contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Mbappe's contract situation could hand Edu a major boost in keeping the Englishman at the club

                The MCA Public Services and Complaints Department head said the government should rethink its proposal to amend bankruptcy laws and lower the threshold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the data from the Insolvency Department, the number of bankrupts has been gradually decreasing – 16,482 in 2018, 12,051 (2019), 8,351 (2020), 6,554 (2021) to 3,604 as of July this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The drop in the number of insolvents was due to amendments to the Insolvency Act in 2017, which saw the bankruptcy threshold raised from RM30,000 to RM50,000 and in 2020 when it was raised again from RM50,000 to RM100,000

            <p>
                The government plans to amend the insolvency laws which includes reviewing the threshold and putting in place a mechanism for the automatic lifting of the bankruptcy status
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the amendments are carried out, Chong suggested that a board be set up to scrutinise applications made by those seeking to lift their bankruptcy status

                Speaking at the reference proceedings yesterday to honour the memory of former Lord President, the late Tun Dr Mohamed Salleh Abas, she said 1988 would always be remembered as the darkest chapter in the history of the Malaysian judiciary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was then that its independence, vouchsafed by the Federal Constitution, was stunned by the removal of Salleh as Lord President
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In paying tribute to Salleh, Tengku Maimun said the former Lord President was a great and courageous legal luminary who had staunchly defended the Constitution and championed the judiciary’s independence to the very end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During Salleh’s tenure as Lord President, the Malaysian judiciary was hailed as a model for other countries in terms of the independence of credibility of the judiciary, she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tengku Maimun said Salleh had repeatedly said it had always been his fervent hope to address the Bench or at the very least to have a simple do, to mark his departure as the Lord President
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After quitting politics, Salleh practised law and appeared frequently in the Federal Court and Court of Appeal.

                Liverpool are preparing an offer in January for a 21-year-old £9M rated Brazilian midfielder who could be their Fabinho replacement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joao Gomes is a rising star in Brazilian football and Liverpool have reportedly identified him as a target for the January window

            <p>
                With Liverpool needing to revitalise their midfield, as well as plan for the future, Gomes seems an exciting prospect and potentially a perfect Fabinho replacement at the base of midfield

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 15 — The Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) has filed an appeal against the High Court’s decision in allowing Petaling Jaya Member of Parliament Maria Chin Abdullah to challenge the Syariah High Court’s decision over the committal proceedings against her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the notice of appeal obtained through a search of the court system, the AGC filed the notice in the Court of Appeal on September 9 because it was not satisfied with the High Court’s overall decision on August 22
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On August 22, Judge Datuk Wan Ahmad Farid Wan Salleh allowed Maria’s leave application for a judicial review after ruling that she had not challenged any part of the Islamic law that falls within the jurisdiction of the Shariah Court but she was challenging the jurisdiction of the Shariah Court over the committal proceedings against her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maria, among other things, applied for the civil high court to quash the action and decision of the Syariah High Court on October 14, 2019, which she claimed had wrongly allowed the committal order and for a show cause notice to be issued on her, as it was against the provisions of the Federal Constitution and violated Rule 52 of the Rules of Court 2012 and the Syariah Court Civil Procedure (Federal Territories) Act 1998
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On December 4, 2020, Maria was ordered to show cause in the committal proceedings, as to why she should not be charged with contempt of court for criticising the Syariah High Court’s decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was due to the court rejecting her application for an extension of time to challenge the court’s decision to allow committal proceedings to be initiated against her
            </p>

            <p>
                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 15 — The Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) has filed an appeal against the High Court’s decision in allowing Petaling Jaya Member of Parliament Maria Chin Abdullah to challenge the Syariah High Court’s decision over the committal proceedings against her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the notice of appeal obtained through a search of the court system, the AGC filed the notice in the Court of Appeal on September 9 because it was not satisfied with the High Court’s overall decision on August 22
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On August 22, Judge Datuk Wan Ahmad Farid Wan Salleh allowed Maria’s leave application for a judicial review after ruling that she had not challenged any part of the Islamic law that falls within the jurisdiction of the Shariah Court but she was challenging the jurisdiction of the Shariah Court over the committal proceedings against her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maria, among other things, applied for the civil high court to quash the action and decision of the Syariah High Court on October 14, 2019, which she claimed had wrongly allowed the committal order and for a show cause notice to be issued on her, as it was against the provisions of the Federal Constitution and violated Rule 52 of the Rules of Court 2012 and the Syariah Court Civil Procedure (Federal Territories) Act 1998
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On December 4, 2020, Maria was ordered to show cause in the committal proceedings, as to why she should not be charged with contempt of court for criticising the Syariah High Court’s decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was due to the court rejecting her application for an extension of time to challenge the court’s decision to allow committal proceedings to be initiated against her
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                He said Muhammad Shafee had told the MACC that the RM9.5 million was a loan from Najib and therefore did not have to declare it to the IRB or pay taxes as it was not income in the first place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Harvinderjit Singh, representing Muhammad Shafee, said the RM9.5 million received by his client from Najib was not from illegal activities

                At the end of the submissions, Judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin set October 28 as to whether Muhammad Shafee will be acquitted or has to enter his defence against the four charges he is facing

            <p>
                On September 13, 2018, Muhammad Shafee pleaded not guilty to receiving proceeds from unlawful activity via cheques issued by Najib, which were remitted into Muhammad Shafee’s CIMB Bank Berhad account

            <p>

                Bureau of Labor Statistics has released a report showing the second consecutive monthly drop in producer prices, prompted by steadily declining gasoline prices.  The Producer Price Index (PPI) shows final demand dropping by 0.1% in August, compared with a 0.4% drop in July.  Overall, the latest PPI shows a 1.2% drop in prices for goods.  That drop in prices for goods is attributed to continually falling gasoline prices, which have dropped nearly 13%.

                Sadio Mane left Liverpool to join Bayern Munich this summer, but after a strong start his recent form has tailed off with no goal across his last four appearances for the German champions  Sadio Mane’s six-year spell on Merseyside came to an end this summer when he left Liverpool to join German champions Bayern Munich in a £35million deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Four goals across his opening four Bayern matches suggested his adaptation was going to be seamless, yet he’s failed to find the back of the net in each of his last four matches and was withdrawn in his most recent appearance, a 2-0 win over Barcelona, before the 70th minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm certain he will succeed for us." A key difference at Bayern so far has been that Mane has been played almost exclusively as a centre-forward in 4-2-3-1, with the only exception being in Tuesday’s clash against Barcelona where he lined up in a left-sided role, as he often did for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Will Sadio Mane regret his decision to leave Liverpool? Have your say in the comments below
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He’s averaging more shots for Bayern than he was for Liverpool (4.22 vs 3.16) and more of those are finding the target (2.22 vs 1.18)
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Sadio Mane left Liverpool to join Bayern Munich this summer, but after a strong start his recent form has tailed off with no goal across his last four appearances for the German champions  Sadio Mane’s six-year spell on Merseyside came to an end this summer when he left Liverpool to join German champions Bayern Munich in a £35million deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Four goals across his opening four Bayern matches suggested his adaptation was going to be seamless, yet he’s failed to find the back of the net in each of his last four matches and was withdrawn in his most recent appearance, a 2-0 win over Barcelona, before the 70th minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm certain he will succeed for us." A key difference at Bayern so far has been that Mane has been played almost exclusively as a centre-forward in 4-2-3-1, with the only exception being in Tuesday’s clash against Barcelona where he lined up in a left-sided role, as he often did for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Will Sadio Mane regret his decision to leave Liverpool? Have your say in the comments below
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He’s averaging more shots for Bayern than he was for Liverpool (4.22 vs 3.16) and more of those are finding the target (2.22 vs 1.18)

                Earlier this month, the road transport department (JPJ) carried out a raid on a company processing inDriver applications
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The firm was suspected of operating with a business licence that had expired
            </p>
            
            <p>
                inDriver, a ride-hailing service provider headquartered in California, United States, made its local debut in October last year

                ActivTrades’s market analyst Alexander Londono said high inflation expectations, even in Asia, have kept investors away from riskier assets and they have continued to favour safe-haven assets such as the US dollar

            <p>
                Londono said that if the reading on the Producer Price Index from the United States (US) came out higher than expected, then the US dollar might increase further and the ringgit could keep dropping

            <p>
                Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd chief economist Firdaos Rosli noted that the ringgit would remain under pressure against the US dollar as the interest rate gap widens, while the US federal funds rate would be higher than the overnight policy rate (OPR) by next week

                He said the market was also reacting to the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data which showed that the country’s inflation has remained high, despite the lower oil prices in August and the aggressive rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) over the past few months

                In a Facebook post on Wednesday (Sept 14), Zaid questioned the Bar Council's motive behind the statement

            <p>
                "It is as if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is confirmed to give Najib the royal pardon

            <p>
                He added that he was also saddened by pressure on the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to not grant a pardon to Najib

            <p>
                On Tuesday (Sept 13), the Bar Council issued a statement saying Najib did not deserve a royal pardon as he had only begun to serve his jail sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its president, Karen Cheah Yee Lynn, said a full pardon at this stage would be perceived as premature as Najib was still facing numerous other charges and would set a "dangerous precedent" that powerful politicians were "above the law or beyond reproach".

                The Ukrainian-born envoy, Dmitry Kozak, told Putin that he believed the deal he had hammered out removed the need for Russia to pursue a large-scale occupation of Ukraine, according to these sources

            <p>

                Premier League • England Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar has spoken of his regret at the late transfer window move of Antony to Manchester United – but admits it is something Ajax have been forced to get used to over the years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But for sure, we will miss him, especially on nights like tonight [at Anfield].” Van der Sar admits Ajax were determined to resist United’s approaches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And with the player also pushing for the move, Van der Sar admits they were simply left with little choice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the end, the money on offer to both Ajax and the player was simply too big to turn down

                ActivTrades trader Dyogenes Rodrigues Diniz said the United States (US) Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed higher-than-expected inflation at 8.3 per cent, versus the forecast of 8.1 per cent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Prior to the release of the CPI data, the market was predicting a 0.5 - 0.75 increase, but now many have raised their forecast to a 0.75-1.0 per cent hike,” he told Bernama
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also noted that oil benchmark Brent crude price fell by 0.08 per cent to US$93.10 per barrel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He explained that the ringgit’s performance should be viewed holistically, not just in comparison with the US dollar, as the local note has also strengthened against other currencies

                — AFP ELIZABETH is majestic, hardy and “very fashionable”, said a top Singapore flower curator – referring not to the late monarch, but to an orchid named after the queen when she visited the former colony
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After Queen Elizabeth II’s death last week, the city-state’s Botanic Gardens loaned a towering sprig of Dendrobium Elizabeth to the British high commissioner’s residence, to be displayed alongside pictures of the monarch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The orchid hybrid, with twisted Dresden-yellow petals and a uranium-green lip, was named in honour of the queen when she visited Singapore in 1972, said Whang Lay Keng, curator at Singapore’s National Orchid Garden
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Dendrobium Elizabeth is a majestic, robust and resilient plant,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It’s kind of like how Queen Elizabeth carried herself.” Flowering twice a year, the Dendrobium Elizabeth was bred from orchids originating from Singapore and Papua New Guinea, and carries around 40 blooms per plant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Queen Elizabeth first made a state visit to Singapore in 1972, followed by two more trips in 1989 and 2006

                Jota shows the way Liverpool’s gamebreaker is back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It showed what Liverpool had been missing this campaign, Jota making his first start having been absent for almost two months with a hamstring problem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That, though, is what Liverpool require right now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His race understandably run midway through the second half, Jota was replaced by Darwin Nunez, the Uruguayan having netted the goal for Benfica that knocked Ajax out of the Champions League last season and set up his personal showcase against Liverpool

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 14 — DAP will hold a special congress this September 25 to amend its party’s constitution to be in line with the recently gazetted anti-party hopping Bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its national organising secretary Steven Sim said the amendment is to close a loophole that could allow any of its lawmakers to quit the party and become an independent representative before joining another political party, thereby circumventing the new law to prevent party-hopping which could destabilise the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "When the law was debated in Parliament, the minister said the loophole could be closed by the party’s constitution so that is what we are doing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "DAP is among the first parties to support the anti-hopping law and we will amend our constitution to close the loophole,” he told a press conference at its national party headquarters today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sim said the amendments will affect Sections 3 and 9 of the party’s constitution, which empowers the DAP's central executive council and secretary-general to penalise its representatives in the Dewan Rakyat, Dewan Negara and any state legislative assembly who fail to follow party orders
            </p>

                The motion was tabled under Article 14A of the Penang Constitution that compels a member of the state legislative assembly to vacate the seat contested as a candidate of a political party should he quit or be expelled from the party or switches to another midterm

            <p>
                In their suits against the state legislative assembly and the Speaker, the four had referred a question to the Federal Court on whether Article 14A of the Penang constitution is void for being inconsistent with Article 10(1)(c) of the Federal Constitution

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 13 — The Edge Group publisher Datuk Ho Kay Tat asked authorities today to justify criminally charging two journalists over a businessman’s claim of defamation from two articles on penny stock manipulation published in 2020 and 2021

            <p>
                Earlier today, former editor-in-chief of The Edge Azam Aris was charged with two counts of criminal defamation against a Malaysian businessman and four firms in the offending reports

                Dr Mahathir, 97, as the plaintiff said his ancestry does not make him “less Malay” or “non-Malay”

                Dr Mahathir filed a lawsuit against Ahmad Zahid, 69, on July 20 for allegedly issuing defamatory statements regarding the “kutty” issue

            <p>
                In his statement of claim, Dr Mahathir claimed that Ahmad Zahid had issued a defamatory statement against him during the Umno divisional meeting in Kelana Jaya on July 30, 2017, and the statement was reproduced on Astro Awani’s YouTube and several online news portals, which can be accessed by internet users without any restrictions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that the slanderous statement meant that he was not born as a Malay or a Muslim with the alleged original name of “Mahathir son of Iskandar Kutty” and that he claimed to be a Malay when he became prime minister to gain political and personal advantage apart from belittling Malaysians of Indian Muslim descent

                Dr Mahathir filed a lawsuit against Ahmad Zahid, 69, on July 20 for allegedly issuing defamatory statements regarding the “kutty” issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Mahathir claimed that the defendant also failed to take appropriate and reasonable measures to obtain explanations from him before making the slanderous statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his statement of claim, Dr Mahathir claimed that Ahmad Zahid had issued a defamatory statement against him during the Umno divisional meeting in Kelana Jaya on July 30, 2017, and the statement was reproduced on Astro Awani’s YouTube and several online news portals, which can be accessed by internet users without any restrictions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed that the slanderous statement meant that he was not born as a Malay or a Muslim with the alleged original name of “Mahathir son of Iskandar Kutty” and that he claimed to be a Malay when he became prime minister to gain political and personal advantage apart from belittling Malaysians of Indian Muslim descent

                The soy sauce in question was Indonesian made ABC Sweet Soy Sauce but according to Dr Noor Hisham a "Hold, Test and Release" order had been imposed on the products since June 2021

            <p>
                There could be an issue if Goretzka doesn’t get the minutes he desires ahead of the World Cup and it could fracture his relationship with Naglesmann – but only time will tell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool had moved for him back in 2020, but he turned them down because of Bayern
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He’s a really effective midfielder when on form
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool have lacked someone with that attacking intent in midfield for a long time now and he could be a great solution to their midfield problem.

                Tonight, Glenavon Academy player Christopher Atherton made his first team debut against Dollingstown in the League Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He can play striker, he can play right, left wing, he can play in behind the frontman, he could play central midfield too, he's just such a good player," Hamilton said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He can play up front but he would be more of a link player and more of the player that goes in behind the striker and gets on the ball and stuff like that and makes things happen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hamilton was set to give Atherton his debut in the last game of the previous campaign, but he was away with his father at a Celtic game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Glenavon boss said he had no immediate plans to play Atherton in senior league matches but said the 13-year-old had the potential to surpass the achievements of any of the club's academy graduates if he moves to England in future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We know the jump that there is to England, we know that and we know it's massive -- we've had kids go over before -- but all I can say is, based on my experiences, he's as good as the ones that have gone across the water, if not better at the same age

                Tonight, Glenavon Academy player Christopher Atherton made his first team debut against Dollingstown in the League Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He can play striker, he can play right, left wing, he can play in behind the frontman, he could play central midfield too, he's just such a good player," Hamilton said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He can play up front but he would be more of a link player and more of the player that goes in behind the striker and gets on the ball and stuff like that and makes things happen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hamilton was set to give Atherton his debut in the last game of the previous campaign, but he was away with his father at a Celtic game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Glenavon boss said he had no immediate plans to play Atherton in senior league matches but said the 13-year-old had the potential to surpass the achievements of any of the club's academy graduates if he moves to England in future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We know the jump that there is to England, we know that and we know it's massive -- we've had kids go over before -- but all I can say is, based on my experiences, he's as good as the ones that have gone across the water, if not better at the same age
            </p>

                However, Barcelona decided that they would go after Raphinha over his younger compatriot and started working on the deal well ahead of the summer, eventually landing the Brazilian international from Leeds United

                The report states that the Barcelona shot-callers decided on Raphinha as they felt that he is more of a team player than his compatriot, with Cruyff getting the feeling that Antony was more of an ‘individualistic’ player

            <p>
                Barça also felt that Raphinha was much more mature and a more complete player than Antony, which also played a part in their decision to sign the 25-year-old winger over the Manchester United new boy

                Liverpool could look to sell up to five players next summer as they plan their summer re-build
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This summer saw an era come to an end with Sadio Mane leaving for Bayern Munich and that could be the start of another upheaval for next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Out of those players, all but Gomez are out of contract next summer and it remains likely that they will all depart
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bellingham is the long-term target and after missing out on Aurelien Tchouameni this summer, Klopp will want to secure his man this time around
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bellingham will have the last word, but we won’t see any movement on that until the end of this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What we know for sure is that we will see players depart next summer and the midfield has to see some changes if Liverpool want to be successful again.

                Liverpool could look to sell up to five players next summer as they plan their summer re-build
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This summer saw an era come to an end with Sadio Mane leaving for Bayern Munich and that could be the start of another upheaval for next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Out of those players, all but Gomez are out of contract next summer and it remains likely that they will all depart
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bellingham is the long-term target and after missing out on Aurelien Tchouameni this summer, Klopp will want to secure his man this time around
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bellingham will have the last word, but we won’t see any movement on that until the end of this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What we know for sure is that we will see players depart next summer and the midfield has to see some changes if Liverpool want to be successful again.

                Just a month after introducing full-time employment with minimum salary to AirAsia Food and Xpress riders, AirAsia has just announced full-time employment for all AirAsia Ride eHailing drivers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to AirAsia, the full-time employment option which is also known as Full-Time drivers is an enhancement and addition to AirAsia Ride’s current and existing Independent Drivers program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As Full-time AirAsia Ride drivers, they will also be given priority to take airport job assignments which will enable them to earn more from airport pick-ups and drop-offs, as travel demand continues to ramp up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last month, we became first in the region to offer gig delivery riders a full-time job, and today we commemorate AirAsia ride’s first year in operations by announcing another unprecedented move – to offer all qualified AirAsia ride drivers full-time employment as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our competitors penalise drivers for not taking jobs which they don’t intend to do, but we see it from another perspective and reward drivers who have shown a good track record and strong commitment to the job by offering them a solid career path with AirAsia ride.  “Any Independent Driver can opt to become a Full-time Driver with better income, and eventually grow into corporate roles at AirAsia ride including being a Fleet Manager, Driver Coach, Operations Executive and more

                “On the auspicious occasion of Your Majesty’s official proclamation as King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by the Accession Council, I would like to extend to Your Majesty my warmest congratulations and best wishes for Your Majesty’s future wellbeing as well as for the great prosperity of your country and happiness of all your loyal subjects,” King Sihamoni stated in the letter dated Sept 12

            <p>
                The Prince of Wales was proclaimed King Charles III on Sept 10 after Queen Elizabeth II passed away two days prior at the age of 96
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 12, Prime Minister Hun Sen paid tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II at the British embassy in Phnom Penh, writing in their condolences book that he was filled with "profound grief" to have learned of the passing of the Queen at Balmoral Castle in Scotland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the demise of Queen Elizabeth II was not only a great loss to the UK and the Commonwealth, but also to the world at large
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The late Queen, Hun Sen wrote, emerged as a beloved public figure through her reign, her discipline and the ways she inspired people and that she will forever be remembered in the hearts of all of the British people and the hearts of many others around the world

                Ismail Sabri, 62, applied for the injunction in a suit he filed against Lokman, 49, on Sept 8
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister, who is an Umno vice-president, filed the suit in his personal capacity

                In the statement of claim, Ismail Sabri, 62, stated that Lokman had on Aug 22 made defamatory statements against him in a video, with the title "Bila Presiden UMNO Panggil Tak Datang! Tapi PM Ada Masa Jumpa Mahathir - Lokman Adam” (When Called by UMNO President, He Doesn't Come! But the PM Has Time to See Mahathir - Lokman Adam)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed the malicious, defamatory and untrue statements were uploaded on four social media accounts belonging to the defendant, namely "Lokman Adam" Youtube, "Lokman Noor Adam Official" Facebook, "lokmanooradam" Instagram and "datoklokmanadam" Tik Tok
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 1, Lokman pleaded not guilty in the Sessions Court here to two charges of making and initiating offensive communications against Ismail Sabri and the government through a Facebook application under the profile name "Lokman Noor Adam Official"

                The research house noted that the OPR hike could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term but will not have a too negative impact on corporates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current OPR rate of 2.5% is still below the pre-Covid level of 3%, leading CGS-CIMB to forecast the central bank to raise the OPR by another 50 bps (via two 25-bps hikes) next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The rate hike is also negative for companies with high floating-rate ringgit borrowings, due to higher interest expense
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our analysis shows the OPR hike having the largest positive impact on Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd (7.6% increase in financial year 2023 or FY23 net profit for every 25-bps hike) as its forecast floating-rate loan ratio of 91% in FY23 is the sector’s highest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Conversely, the impact would be the smallest on Affin Bank Bhd’s forecast FY23 net profit (0.2% increase for every 25-bps hike) as its forecast FY23 floating-rate loan ratio of 74.1% is one of the lowest in the sector,” CGS-CIMB noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that if it were to factor in the OPR hike projected in 2023, every additional 25-bps hike would increase its net profit forecasts for banks by an estimated 2.1% (on a full-year basis; for FY24 for Hong Leong Bank Bhd, AMMB Holdings Bhd and Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd, and FY23 for the rest)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The positive impact from the OPR hike could be partly diluted by higher cost of funds from a pick-up in deposit competition,” it said.

                A report has claimed that Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp had three more experienced attacking options on the table before he sanctioned a deal for Darwin Núñez
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In truth, Liverpool probably wouldn’t have been able to pull off a deal for Son, especially after Spurs qualified for the Champions League

            <p>
                Liverpool, of course, sold Sadio Mané to Bayern, and a swap deal of sorts may have been feasible, reuniting former Dortmund striker Lewandowski with Klopp on Merseyside
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He may not have any Premier League experience, but he would still have been close to a guaranteed hit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Klopp still believes this is a smarter investment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp and Liverpool also knew that if they moved for Lewandowski, they would be back in the market midway through the decade in search of another marquee striker signing

                A report has claimed that Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp had three more experienced attacking options on the table before he sanctioned a deal for Darwin Núñez
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In truth, Liverpool probably wouldn’t have been able to pull off a deal for Son, especially after Spurs qualified for the Champions League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool, of course, sold Sadio Mané to Bayern, and a swap deal of sorts may have been feasible, reuniting former Dortmund striker Lewandowski with Klopp on Merseyside
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He may not have any Premier League experience, but he would still have been close to a guaranteed hit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Klopp still believes this is a smarter investment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp and Liverpool also knew that if they moved for Lewandowski, they would be back in the market midway through the decade in search of another marquee striker signing

                Mohamad, who is popularly known as Tok Mat, added that the party's priority at the moment was to strengthen and prepare its election machinery in all divisions first before deciding on the issue of seat distribution and candidates

                There are some rumours coming out of Indonesia that we are due to see a next generation Toyota Innova launched there as early as November 2022, which is 2 months from now, and it might be called the Toyota Innova Zenix
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What is called the Toyota Innova in the Malaysian market is called the Toyota Kijang Innova in Indonesia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is a top of the line variant there called the Toyota Kijang Innova Venturer, so the word Zenix might be some form of top of the line variant suffix
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alternatively, the name of the car could be renamed to Innova Zenix or simply Zenix, just like how the Avanza Veloz eventually became just the Toyota Veloz with the latest generation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Essentially, the new Toyota Innova Zenix will end up being a three-row MPV version of the Toyota Corolla Cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Veloz sits below the Kijang Innova, priced from Rp 286,000,000 for the manual up to Rp 331,100,000 for the Veloz Q CVT with Toyota Safety Sense

                About Us Advertise BERA, Sept 11 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob today said that he has yet to discuss with Umno’s top five the date for the 15th General Election (GE15)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno’s top five refers to its president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan and the three vice-presidents, Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin, Datuk Seri Mahdzir Khalid and Ismail Sabri himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That’s the procedure that needs to be observed,” he said in his speech at the presentation of the 2022 allocation for the Chinese and Indian communities in the Bera parliamentary constituency at Bera Umno Complex in Padang Luas here today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Ismail Sabri told BN leaders in the Bera parliamentary constituency to be ready with their election machinery and to meet with the voters to maintain the coalition’s victory in Bera and the Guai and Kemayan state seats, and recapture the Triang state seat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri said in Bera, the BN machinery should work hard not only to maintain the parliamentary and the Guai and Kemayan state seats, but also to win back the Triang state seat from DAP
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, has announced that the new living allowance rate for local students has been increased from a minimum of RM650 to a maximum of RM950 per month from diploma to professional and doctoral degree levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The living allowance was used towards accommodation, food, transportation, and daily needs, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the existing allowance rate had been used for over 13 years and there was a need to review it following the increase in the cost of living in the country over the past 10 years, the coronavirus pandemic and other issues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is between 60 and 70% of the allowance received by each student,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the living allowance for Mara and JPA students, such as in London, was £1,045 or RM5,712, much lower than the UK government’s recommended median of £1,312 or RM7,172 as of September 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When met by reporters after the ceremony, Ismail Sabri said he had instructed the JPA to also review the living allowance rates for JPA-sponsored students.

                Terengganu fan Mohd Shahrul Ikhwan Muda said they did not waste the opportunity to come to KL to support their team as it had been sometime since they qualified for a major football final
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hopefully, this will be our time,” said Shahrul, who spent more than RM3,000 to bring his family of nine to watch the FA Cup final live
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Terengganu are playing once again in a major football final since 2011
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Interestingly, that was also the year when Terengganu last lifted the trophy after edging Kelantan 2-1 at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                JDT, on the other hand, also have their eyes on the Cup for the first time since 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                JDT beat the now-defunct PKNS 2-1 at the Shah Alam Stadium that year and a win will erase the memories of their painful 0-2 defeat to Kuala Lumpur in the Malaysia Cup final at the same venue last year

                Terengganu fan Mohd Shahrul Ikhwan Muda said they did not waste the opportunity to come to KL to support their team as it had been sometime since they qualified for a major football final
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hopefully, this will be our time,” said Shahrul, who spent more than RM3,000 to bring his family of nine to watch the FA Cup final live
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Terengganu are playing once again in a major football final since 2011
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Interestingly, that was also the year when Terengganu last lifted the trophy after edging Kelantan 2-1 at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                JDT, on the other hand, also have their eyes on the Cup for the first time since 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                JDT beat the now-defunct PKNS 2-1 at the Shah Alam Stadium that year and a win will erase the memories of their painful 0-2 defeat to Kuala Lumpur in the Malaysia Cup final at the same venue last year

                Britain's King Charles III during his first audience with Prime Minister Liz Truss at Buckingham Palace, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday, in London, Britain September 9, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Truss, who was appointed prime minister by Elizabeth on Tuesday in her last public act, was one of several senior lawmakers who swore a new oath of allegiance to the new king in a special session in parliament earlier on Saturday following the queen's death
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was also present, along with six former prime ministers, senior bishops and several politicians, when Charles, 73, was officially proclaimed Britain's new king in a colourful ceremony laden with pageantry and tradition
            </p>

                "In terms of the prime minister's involvement, she will join the king as he leads the national mourning across the United Kingdom, attending services of reflection in Scotland on Monday afternoon, in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, and Wales on Friday," the spokesman told reporters

                Britain's William, Prince of Wales, Catherine, Princess of Wales, Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, walk outside Windsor Castle, following the passing of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, in Windsor, Britain, September 10, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The couple had been in Britain on a brief visit when the queen, Britain's longest reigning monarch, died on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like other senior members of the royal family, Harry rushed to be by the queen's side as she deteriorated at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and a spokesperson for the heir to the throne said an invitation for the Windsor walk had been extended by William
            </p>
            
            <p>
                William spent some time bending down chatting to children, while Kate and Harry accepted flowers and messages of encouragement from those in the crowd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                William was heard telling one well-wisher that the days following the queen's death had been "so surreal"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lilibet was named after the queen's childhood nickname
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA KANGSAR, Sept 11 — A vintage bread and coffee shop that is over 80 years old, still remains to be popular among youngsters here, despite the huge number of hipster cafes mushrooming everywhere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Located in Perak’s royal town, this shop has been the preferred choice of local and foreign visitors who come here specially to enjoy its home-made bread and delicious ‘kaw’ coffee, amid the warm and rusty ambience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to manager Leong Tean Chia, 60, the shop where Double Lion Restaurant had been operating has remained until today because the building materials used then were of high quality and the furniture were built to last
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leong added that another factor why the restaurant is still in business today is because the quality of its home-made bread has remained consistent until today using the same recipe which has been passed down through generations

                Saturday, 10 Sep 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Britain's King Charles III before Privy Council members in the Throne Room during the Accession Council at St James's Palace, London, Saturday, Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Britain, people started gathering outside royal palaces in the early hours of Saturday morning, with thousands flocking to Buckingham Palace to pay respects to the queen and Charles - who was proclaimed king at the nearby St James's Palace
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "(We're) here to be part of that and show respect to the late queen and also to the new king." Charles is king and head of state of the United Kingdom and 14 other realms including Australia, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Charles' coronation as king will take place at a later date - and the timing for that is not yet clear
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Britain's King Charles III before Privy Council members in the Throne Room during the Accession Council at St James's Palace, London, Saturday, Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Britain, people started gathering outside royal palaces in the early hours of Saturday morning, with thousands flocking to Buckingham Palace to pay respects to the queen and Charles - who was proclaimed king at the nearby St James's Palace
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "(We're) here to be part of that and show respect to the late queen and also to the new king." Charles is king and head of state of the United Kingdom and 14 other realms including Australia, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Charles' coronation as king will take place at a later date - and the timing for that is not yet clear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new king vowed on Friday to serve the nation with "loyalty, respect and love" in his first address to the nation as king

                Noting criticism of the Federal Court’s decision last month to uphold the conviction of former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, she said the reasons for doing so were clearly laid out in the written judgment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It can be said that all these are based on mere sentiments without any basis or understanding of the laws or the grounds for judgement itself.” “They did not fully understand the court’s decision,” she said when asked to comment on the criticisms against the courts following the August 23 court decision to uphold Najib’s conviction and sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment along with a RM210 million fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In that matter, Tengku Maimun chaired a five-judge Federal Court panel that dismissed Najib’s final appeal against his SRC International Sdn Bhd graft conviction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She told politicians and the public to read and understand the issue at hand, other than asking for explanation from experts before making any conclusions on a court decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also thanked the Malaysian Bar for expressing its support for the judiciary after it came under attack over the decision and for its efforts to help clarify the matter to Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, the Malaysian Bar had denounced the attacks, threats and criticisms hurled against the judiciary and Tengku Maimun over the decision

                Noting criticism of the Federal Court’s decision last month to uphold the conviction of former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, she said the reasons for doing so were clearly laid out in the written judgment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It can be said that all these are based on mere sentiments without any basis or understanding of the laws or the grounds for judgement itself.” “They did not fully understand the court’s decision,” she said when asked to comment on the criticisms against the courts following the August 23 court decision to uphold Najib’s conviction and sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment along with a RM210 million fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In that matter, Tengku Maimun chaired a five-judge Federal Court panel that dismissed Najib’s final appeal against his SRC International Sdn Bhd graft conviction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She told politicians and the public to read and understand the issue at hand, other than asking for explanation from experts before making any conclusions on a court decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also thanked the Malaysian Bar for expressing its support for the judiciary after it came under attack over the decision and for its efforts to help clarify the matter to Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, the Malaysian Bar had denounced the attacks, threats and criticisms hurled against the judiciary and Tengku Maimun over the decision

                But it was pure coincidence that Harry was in Britain when Elizabeth died, and prior to her demise there were no plans announced for him to see his family during his visit from the United States, where he lives with his American wife Meghan
            </p>

            <p>
                But their plan did not wash with Elizabeth, Charles or William, who ruled that there was no space in the Firm, as the royal family is sometimes called, for part-timers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meghan’s mother is Black and her father is white

                But it was pure coincidence that Harry was in Britain when Elizabeth died, and prior to her demise there were no plans announced for him to see his family during his visit from the United States, where he lives with his American wife Meghan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I want also to express my love for Harry and Meghan as they continue to build their lives overseas,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But that novelty alone is unlikely to restore harmony in Harry’s relationships with Charles or with elder brother Prince William, now the heir to the throne
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The brothers were close for many years after the death of their mother Diana in a car crash in 1997, when William was 15 and Harry was 12, but their bond has been strained since Harry and Meghan began distancing themselves in January 2020

            <p>
                But their plan did not wash with Elizabeth, Charles or William, who ruled that there was no space in the Firm, as the royal family is sometimes called, for part-timers

                It’s natural to indulge in a little hyperbole immediately after a match but it’s genuinely difficult to recall a game in which Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool played so poorly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool’s top performer was undoubtedly Luis Díaz though

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds!  Oh, and he scored a goal, his 10th for the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the 809 goals scored by Klopp’s Liverpool, the figure stands at 71 per cent

                Following a 4-0 defeat to Udinese in Serie A last weekend, Roma began their Europa League campaign with a 2-1 loss to Ludogorets in Bulgaria on Thursday.  The team have shown the same problems that the Portuguese coach inherited from his predecessor Paulo Fonseca.  Mourinho is well aware of the fickleness of Italian football fans and in particular of Roma fans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking to Sky Sports after the Europa League defeat, Mourinho showed his usual defensive attitude, denying the team's unresolved problems.  'I'm not saying we played well because it's not true, but it was a performance sufficient to win or at least not to lose,' he said
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                But this was a second defeat in four days and called in to question Mourinho's ability to motivate his players.  There are Mourinho murals in the popular neighbourhoods of Rome, showing his popularity It is difficult to imagine a coach so experienced who cannot understand the reasons for two poor results and now the fans are asking Mourinho to find a solution to avoid yet another disappointing season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without the injured Abraham, the team look lost in attack.  Inter Milan tried to sign Dybala from Juventus in the summer, but Mourinho always had hope of bringing the scarred Argentine gladiator to the city of the Colosseum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His transfer to Roma was perhaps the most interesting in Serie A this summer as he downgraded from a team in the Champions League to a side in the Europa League

                Without naming the religious minister, Azalina questioned the precedent Idris would be setting by silencing and downplaying the child victim's allegations, especially with several Acts already in place that were designed to help and protect victims of sexual abuse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What now of our newly-passed Anti-Sexual Harassment Act or the Child Act or the Sexual Offences Against Children Act? "What kind of messaging and precedent are we setting? Using religion especially to create fear, shame, and obligation to protect the reputation of a sexual predator is against every rule of protective laws for children in this country," she said in a statement today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former law minister then said that Idris' remarks proved that the system is failing to protect vulnerable children, adding that no amount of reputation laundering can erase the trauma experienced by any victim, especially a child
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We have the Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect (SCAN) teams, One-Stop Crises Centres (OSCC), D11 (Sexual, Children and Women Investigation) Division, Child Interview Centres, and Special Courts for sexual crimes against Children in the country, but the resources invested in these platforms remain inadequate," she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, the JAG condemned the victim-blaming and silencing by Idris, after a child survivor spoke up about the abuse she endured at the hands of her father on a YouTube podcast

            <p>

                The prime minister's first meeting with the new monarch came after Charles returned to London, from Scotland, to cheering crowds outside Buckingham Palace who had come to pay their respects to the queen

            <p>

                The meeting took place ahead of a televised address by Charles to the nation, in which he pledged to follow the example of his mother in devoting himself to duty

                The prime minister's first meeting with the new monarch came after Charles returned to London, from Scotland, to cheering crowds outside Buckingham Palace who had come to pay their respects to the queen

                The meeting took place ahead of a televised address by Charles to the nation, in which he pledged to follow the example of his mother in devoting himself to duty

                Counsel Alan Adrian Gomez, representing Thomas, said the lawsuit filed by Najib was an abuse of the court process and cannot be relied on because the four criminal trials are a type of proceedings that can be determined in Najib’s favour

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company said that the retrenchments were made with the view toward keeping foodpanda competitive and profitable, as the layoffs would naturally reduce costs, with a spokesman for the company citing a “critical need” to reduce costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Neither the roles nor the demographics of the retrenched staff in Singapore have been disclosed by the company, however
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In July, the company opened its new regional HQ in Singapore as a home for its global tech hub

                No backup plan." — Netizen Popular food delivery service company foodpanda has laid off 5 per cent of its employees in Singapore, or around 60 workers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company said that the retrenchments were made with the view toward keeping foodpanda competitive and profitable, as the layoffs would naturally reduce costs, with a spokesman for the company citing a “critical need” to reduce costs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Neither the roles nor the demographics of the retrenched staff in Singapore have been disclosed by the company, however

            <p>
                In July, the company opened its new regional HQ in Singapore as a home for its global tech hub

                KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 9) - A businessman was charged in the Sessions Court here today for allegedly duping a Datin Seri over an Islamic fund investment five years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Calvin Damian Wong, 30, pleaded not guilty after the charge was read before Judge Datin Sabariah Othman on Friday (Sept 9)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The man allegedly deceived Datin Seri Alauyah Jaafar, 58, by tricking the victim into a unit trust investment promising high returns, which prompted the victim to hand over a RM150,000 cheque made to the account of the accused's company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court allowed bail at RM25,000 with one guarantor and set Oct 12 for re-mention of the case

                The subtle and stationary memorial appeared shortly after news of the queen’s death broke Thursday morning

                “Prince Harry should be ashamed to have put Queen Elizabeth II through the Meghan Markle saga in the last years of her life,” tweeted Lavern Spicer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If you’re tweeting blaming Harry and Meghan for the Queen’s ill health, let me remind you that a) she’s 96 years of age, and b) Prince Andrew,” tweeted Michelle Harris
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With their Archewell message, Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan joined a number of fellow pop culture figures, including Elton John and Helen Mirren, who remembered the queen fondly

                OVER the decades since World War Two ended in 1945, it has been said from time-to-time that Queen Elizabeth II had served in a hands-on capacity as a mechanic and lorry driver

            <p>
                After joining, she trained as a driver and mechanic with the rank of Second Subaltern

            <p>
                Five months later she was promoted to Junior Commander, which was the equivalent of Captain.” By doing this, the Queen had been the first woman in the British Royal Family to serve full-time in the armed services

            <p>
                Interestingly, she had to win over her father, King George VI as he had ruled that her training as a princess was more important than the UK than working in an auxiliary service or in a factory

            <p>
                However, when she turned 18 in 1944, the Princess was determined to follow her peers and “do her bit” for the war effort

                Here are five talking points from the first European night of Erik ten Hag's Old Trafford tenure..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United have shown commendable character to recover from a nightmare start to the season in recent weeks, but their recent revival was snuffed out by Real Sociedad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are likely to be plenty of ups and downs for Manchester United under Ten Hag this season, but the meek manner of this defeat will have disappointed their new boss in the wake of their recent improvement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was not a night to remember for United's No.7 - who is now likely to revert back to the bench after failing to make the most of his chance to impress
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 30-year-old was at the heart of United's best moves on the night and looked streets ahead of his teammates at times

            <p>
                Here are five talking points from the first European night of Erik ten Hag's Old Trafford tenure..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United have shown commendable character to recover from a nightmare start to the season in recent weeks, but their recent revival was snuffed out by Real Sociedad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are likely to be plenty of ups and downs for Manchester United under Ten Hag this season, but the meek manner of this defeat will have disappointed their new boss in the wake of their recent improvement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was not a night to remember for United's No.7 - who is now likely to revert back to the bench after failing to make the most of his chance to impress
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 30-year-old was at the heart of United's best moves on the night and looked streets ahead of his teammates at times

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 9 — The new Touch ‘n Go card with NFC function is still a highly sought-after product
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you’re looking for a different way to buy the new TNG card online without paying sky-high scalper prices, the card is now sold via Lazada
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Lazada, LazMall is the first and only marketplace eCommerce platform to sell the new TNG card with NFC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sale of the new card started this morning at 9am but it has already sold out at the time of writing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To recap, the TNG NFC card is an enhanced Touch ‘n Go card that allows users to top up the card balance using a smartphone instead of going to a physical kiosk or over the counter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since the card has to be linked to your Touch ‘n Go Wallet, this also means that PayDirect is enabled automatically for the card

            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you’re looking for a different way to buy the new TNG card online without paying sky-high scalper prices, the card is now sold via Lazada
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Lazada, LazMall is the first and only marketplace eCommerce platform to sell the new TNG card with NFC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sale of the new card started this morning at 9am but it has already sold out at the time of writing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To recap, the TNG NFC card is an enhanced Touch ‘n Go card that allows users to top up the card balance using a smartphone instead of going to a physical kiosk or over the counter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since the card has to be linked to your Touch ‘n Go Wallet, this also means that PayDirect is enabled automatically for the card

                At the current OPR level, the stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth,” it said

                In its statement, BNM said the MPC is not on any pre-set course and will continue to assess evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook to domestic inflation and growth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Any adjustments to the monetary policy settings going forward would be done in a measured and gradual manner, ensuring that monetary policy remains accommodative to support a sustainable economic growth in an environment of price stability,” it said

            <p>
                BNM said going forward, indicators point to continued growth, underpinned by support from private-sector spending

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 8 — Retired top judge Tun Abdul Hamid Mohamad has indicated that Malaysia’s legal and judicial systems would become an international laughing stock if convicted former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak were to receive a pardon, Utusan Malaysia reported today

            <p>
                The former chief justice from 2007 to 2008 noted that the Federal Constitution is silent on the grounds for a convicted criminal to receive a pardon, but added that the 2018 full pardon granted to PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has set a precedent
            </p>
            
            <p>

                The grounds for Anwar to get a pardon was only political,” Abdul Hamid was quoted as saying

            <p>
                He added that the question on whether or not Najib should receive a pardon has been politicised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A royal pardon falls under Article 42(1) of the Federal Constitution, which gives the Agong or Sultan the powers to grant a pardon or reprieve to a convict.

                Cristiano Ronaldo (pictured) is set to play in the Europa League for the first time in 20 years Erik ten Hag (right) and his side will face Real Sociedad in their first group game on Thursday Ronaldo's last appearance in the Europa League was back in October 2002 for Sporting Lisbon vs Partizan Belgrade - below, Sportsmail takes a trip down memory lane to recall the occasion Breaking through at Sporting  Laszlo Boloni, first-team manager at Sporting Clube de Portugal, AKA Sporting Lisbon, recognised Cristiano Ronaldo's potential straight away
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Talented winger Ronaldo broke through at the Portuguese club as a teenager (pictured) The Romanian elevated the teenager through the ranks, making him the first player to represent the club's Under-16, U17 and U18 sides, as well as the B team and first team, all in the same season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before his league bow, though, he was thrown into the first-team squad for two matches in the UEFA Cup, now known as the Europa League, arguably helping to launch his senior career.  What happened in the first leg?  Sporting were drawn against Serbian side Partizan Belgrade in the first round, and the first leg, in the Portuguese capital, saw Ronaldo named on the bench, with fellow skilful winger Ricardo Quaresma in the starting line-up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo, however, had made his mark
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So after the transfer window closed earlier this month, it appears Ronaldo will be forced to stay at least until January, raising the prospect of another Europa League appearance 20 years after his first steps in the competition.  Ronaldo announced his desire to leave this summer because he wanted Champions League football - now he might be forced to compete in the Europa League, starting on Thursday night Thursday preview  Dropped after the club's 4-0 humbling against Brentford, Ronaldo now appears to be second-choice up front, with Marcus Rashford preferred after his resurgence amid Ten Hag's desire for pace, mobility and a pressing forward up top
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo, therefore, short of match sharpness, could well be used to spearhead the United attack against Real Sociedad at Old Trafford on Thursday evening

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid has denied that he was responsible for the RM9 billion LCS scandal, and said it was unreasonable to pin the failure of the LCS procurement on him, as he was not the defence minister when the project was awarded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Zahid held the defence minister position from April 2009 to May 2013, and was succeeded by Hishammuddin, and the contract was delayed and only signed on July 17, 2014, the two declassified reports on the LCS scandal, despite being heavily redacted, showed that it is Zahid who must bear greater responsibility than Hishammuddin for the LCS scandal

                However, between the issue of the LOA and the signing of the contract, there were 21 LOAs worth some RM5 billion to procure equipments and systems, most of which were made when Zahid was the defence minister

                As the LOAs made during the time Hishammuddin became the defence minister after the 13th general election did not reach RM700 million, Zahid must bear greater responsibility than Hishammuddin for the LCS scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lastly, Zahid failed to state clearly and specifically that Najib, as the then prime minister and finance minister, was not responsible for the RM9 billion LCS scandal, especially as the LCS procurement went back to when Najib was the defence minister in the Cabinet of Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi

                The three code-named AmIslamic bank accounts are 211-202-201188-0 (AmPrivate Banking-1MY), 211-202-201189-8 (AmPrivate Banking-Y1MY) and 211-202-201190-6 (AmPrivate Banking-MY)

                Najib told the bank he was authorising Nik Faisal to carry out enquiry of the bank accounts’ status and details including the balance of money in the account, and to confirm cheques beyond the amount of RM250,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib instructed AmIslamic bank to clear and confirm all cheques up to the value of RM250,000 without checking with him or Nik Faisal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a June 20, 2013 letter to the same branch manager, Najib confirmed he had appointed Nik Faisal as his authorised personnel to handle his AmBank accounts (but without specifying any bank account) and authorised the latter to confirm the account status and details including account balance, to confirm cheques exceeding the sum of RM250,000, and to take cheque books and statements of account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These three accounts are the same accounts that were given the code names AmPrivate Banking-1MY, AmPrivate Banking-Y1MY and AmPrivate Banking-MY
