                The conduct of Mohd Shafiq must have been so offensive that the union felt compelled to protest at once

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If the cabinet and the government have any brains, they should stick to Mohd Shafiq and even promote him to chief secretary

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                There should have been an immigration officer waiting for his rombongan (entourage) in the VIP area

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The best thing to do I think is for Khiril and the Immigration officer to quietly apologise to Mohd Shafiq

                Even if there is an error in the immigration process or procedure, Mohd Shafiq should use proper discipline channels and not humiliate the officers in public

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Our messaging approach to the Malay community is that we are not against them,” said Loke on his plans to boost support from the community
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                DAP has long struggled to find a foothold in the Malay community, with its enemies branding it a chauvinist party over its struggle for Chinese language and education
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                These values have to be communicated to the Malay community.”  He told FMT in a special interview that there was no magic formula to increase Malay support and the party must continue engaging the Malays and ensure more diversity in the party leadership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                We need to groom more from all communities including the Malay community in order for DAP to become a real multiracial party,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Loke also rejected the notion that DAP was a “bogeyman” among Malays, saying the party was just a “natural punching bag” for Malay-based parties
            </p>

                “All the major Malay parties, be they Umno, PAS or Bersatu, will try to paint us as an anti-Malay party so we (have) become their punching bag

                This comes after the Indonesian Ambassador to Malaysia, Hermono, announced that around 23,000 Indonesian domestic workers (PDI) had been processed and approved for matching with Malaysian employers

                Urging the prime minister to “step up and stop the rot” by providing leadership, the group asked whether the defence minister at the time could be absolved of responsibility for the failed project

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Was the defence minister being aloof about the LCS project or was it that no one took responsibility to adequately brief the minister, said retired brigadier-general Arshad Raji, president of the National Patriots Association

                A company official, Mich Goh, said the new rules could affect the recovery of the tourism industry and the state’s economy and make it difficult for Malaysians to generate income

                She said Airbnb and its local members had given their feedback on the proposed new guidelines at a public dialogue with executive councillor Jagdeep Singh Deo on July 28, Jagdeep had proposed that joint management bodies of flats and apartment buildings impose a strict limit on homestays of up to three nights a week and 180 nights a year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Homestays in commercial strata buildings would be prohibited unless 75% of owners are present at a general meeting to vote to allow homestays in their buildings

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The state government’s proposal came in the wake of protests that many apartment building management boards had banned all homestays in their buildings

                Goh said Airbnb and its members had asked for short-stay activities to be allowed to continue in commercial strata buildings, while joint management boards and property owners can introduce relevant rules on homestays in their buildings

                MCA spokesman Chan Quin Er said the Dewan Rakyat should consider amending the constitution so that overseas-born children could obtain citizenship from “either parent” or “either mother or father” or “both mother and father”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The statements from the MCA and DAP leaders came in the wake of an appeal court ruling today upholding the current law that children derive citizenship from their Malaysian fathers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court overturned a High Court ruling in September in which judge Akhtar Tahir had held that mothers were entitled to confer citizenship by operation of law in all processes, just like fathers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the Court of Appeal ruled by a 2-1 majority today that the word “father” is “clear and unambiguous” and could not be construed to include “mother”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It held that children born overseas to Malaysian mothers can be denied citizenship

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Today’s court decision came in an appeal by the government, the home minister and the director-general of the national registration department against the High Court ruling in September

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 5 — The 118-storey tower in Kuala Lumpur, which is also the world’s second tallest tower at 678.9 metres, is expected to be completed in the middle of next year, its owner PNB Merdeka Ventures Sdn Bhd said yesterday
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ab Aziz said this observation deck — occupying level 115, 116 and a mezzanine floor within level 116 — is expected to open to the public by the end of next year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On November 30, 2021, a 40-storey tall spire on top of the Merdeka 118 tower was completed, boosting the entire tower’s height to 678.9 metres, which made it the highest tower in South-east Asia and second tallest in the world
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At that time, the tower had reached 85 per cent completion, with tower floor installation reaching Level 118 and glass panels installed up to Level 114
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Level 16 inside the spire would be equivalent to 566 metres

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Chinese foreign ministry said it was taking these countermeasures in the light of Pelosi's "insistence on visiting Taiwan in disregard to China's strong opposition and solemn representations"
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The visit of Pelosi, the highest-ranking US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years, has infuriated Beijing, who sees it as a severe provocation and further proof of the hollowing out of Washington's one-China policy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province that needs to be reunified with the mainland, and has not ruled out the use of force to do so
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China on Friday pressed on with its largest-ever military exercises encircling Taiwan and imposed sanctions on US Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her immediate family members, despite widespread criticism from the US, European Union and Japan, as flights were cancelled in and out of Taipei

                Wan Ahmad also said the finance minister did not enjoy unfettered discretion in deciding whether to approve the tax incentive application by the company
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lawyer S Saravana Kumar submitted that the company had met all conditions imposed and, as such, the finance minister’s decision to reject the application was erroneous in law
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The company undertook a hydroelectric power plant in Kapit and had applied for the RM10.9 billion tax incentive in the form of an investment allowance spent on the power plant
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, then finance minister Lim Guan Eng rejected the company’s application without providing any reason
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The lawyer said this was the first case of its kind where the finance minister’s refusal to grant a tax incentive was successfully challenged by the taxpayer, and one that involved a multi-billion ringgit tax incentive claim
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Senior federal counsel Shamsul Bolhassan, who represented the minister, submitted that the Income Tax Act 1967 does not require the minister to provide any reason for rejecting a tax incentive application

                Pembinaan PFI Sdn Bhd is a GLC that was reportedly created to implement private finance initiatives (PFI)
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Pembinaan PFI Sdn Bhd was a shell company, with no operational staff, and was solely operated by its directors
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the collateral for the loans was government land parcels leased to Pembinaan PFI Sdn Bhd by the federal lands commissioner
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                With no income, he said, Pembinaan PFI then sub-leased the same plots of land back to the federal lands commissioner for a sum of RM29 billion to repay the loan from EPF
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gomez claimed that when C4 met with EPF, the pension fund insisted that it had the power to grant a loan RM26.037 billion to Pembinaan PFI and that it was receiving a 4% interest rate on the loan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In its report, C4 stated that funds raised by Pembinaan PFI were loaned in two tranches.  The first loan agreement (PFI 1) in 2007 was for a sum of RM20 billion from EPF, while the second (PFI 2) in 2012 was for RM6.037 billion from EPF and RM3.963 billion from KWAP

                Under Malaysia’s citizenship laws in the Federal Constitution, Malaysian men who marry foreigners would see their children born overseas automatically entitled to Malaysian citizenship

                On September 9, 2021, the High Court ruled that Malaysian mothers’ overseas-born children are entitled to be Malaysian citizens under the law, and ordered the Malaysian authorities to issue citizenship documents to these overseas-born children

                This assemblymen – Dr Afif Bahardin, Zulkifli Ibrahim, Khaliq Mehtab Mohd Ishaq and Zolkifly Md Lazim – had filed an injunction against the Penang state assembly from passing a motion to vacate their seats after they shifted allegiance to PN

                Chow said a special sitting to amend the Penang constitution was not necessary at this juncture since the Federal Court verdict was sufficient

                China views Taiwan as a renegade province to be retaken, by force if necessary

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The US, which maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity towards Taiwan, has not made clear if it would defend the island in the event of an invasion, but under its Taiwan Relations Act, Washington is obliged to provide the island with the means to defend itself

                Another exercise zone to the east of Taiwan could be used as staging grounds to launch strikes against Taiwan's military bases in Hualien and Taitung, while the zone to the west of Taiwan is located at the narrowest part of the Taiwan Strait, said Prof Meng

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 5 — The Bersatu-led Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition might pull its support for Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, which could trigger the collapse of the federal government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The daily reported a Bersatu insider saying the meeting was to press Ismail Sabri to appoint a deputy prime minister from its party as part of the deal signed in August last year with its president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The PN delegation was to comprise Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainuddin and Datuk Seri Azmin Ali from Bersatu and Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan and Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar from PAS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Other purported terms and conditions of the MoU supposedly requires Ismail Sabri to consult the Bersatu leadership before dissolving Parliament
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is learnt that the Bersatu supreme council that met last Tuesday was generally in favour of withdrawing support for Ismail Sabri, but the final decision would be made with its coalition partners
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is learnt that Bersatu’s political bureau will be holding a meeting soon to discuss the party’s next move.

                When asked who were the purported conmen, Zarul Ahmad said one of them was businessman G

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Still under cross-examination, Zarul Ahmad was further grilled by the defence over his preparedness to commit a criminal offence for the sake of protecting someone

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gnanaraja — who was introduced to Zarul Ahmad by former minister Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz — has since been charged with cheating Zarul Ahmad and also had his Datukship revoked by the Pahang Palace in 2019

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, Zarul Ahmad also affirmed in court that he was constantly "attacked" by the Opposition in Penang composed of those from the BN bloc due to his links with the undersea project and sought information from him to be used against Lim

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim is facing an amended charge of using his position as Penang chief minister back then to receive a bribe of RM3.3 million in helping the company owned by Zarul Ahmad to obtain a construction project worth RM6,341,383,702

                For 2021, BNM said in a statement on Feb 11 that Malaysia's GDP grew 3.1% from a year earlier following a 3.6% y-o-y GDP expansion in 4Q21

                Yoon was the only leader not to meet Pelosi in person during her high-stakes Asia trip, which included becoming the highest-level US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years, as well as the first sitting House speaker to visit South Korea in about 20 years

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 5 — Rafizi Ramli has reportedly said he plans to contest in the Pandan seat that he previously held, replacing Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who won it in 2018
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For the time being, it is safe to say I should be able to contest in Pandan,” Rafizi was quoted saying by The Malaysian Insight
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For PKR, by the end of August, the framework and process for candidate selection will be finalised

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If we have not settled the candidates by September, we will be in trouble,” said Rafizi, in reference to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri's recent remark that GE15 is close
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rafizi also stressed his faith in PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as the best prime minister candidate for PH, as he is currently the most prominent figure in the coalition

                In a parliamentary written reply dated Aug 3, Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin said the Penang police had opened disciplinary investigation papers against the two traffic policemen for escorting the son of the MP at Jalan Bukit Gambir in George Town
            </p>

                Yesterday, home minister Hamzah Zainudin told the Dewan Rakyat that 1,461 people applied to withdraw from the programme between September last year and June this year

                Donal Crotty, chairman of the Irish Chamber of Commerce Malaysia, said it appeared that the government had no “real commitment” to the programme, and Center for Market Education CEO Carmelo Ferlito said Putrajaya had sent a message that it sought to attract only people of high net worth

                The MM2H programme is aimed at drawing foreigners for long-term stay in Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, home minister Hamzah Zainudin told the Dewan Rakyat that 1,461 people applied to withdraw from the programme between September last year and June this year
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hamzah claimed that the withdrawals were not due to the new conditions the government had set

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Crotty said the MM2H was originally built on trust, confidence and security, and the government’s policy changes were detrimental to the programme

                According to Saifuddin, the MoU with Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s government had even given him greater “political satisfaction” than PH defeating Barisan Nasional to form the federal government in 2018

                “(The MoU) gave me the highest satisfaction, personally, not because I sat on the MoU’s committee, but because I was involved in doing the right thing,” he said in an interview with Sinar Harian

                He pointed out that Article 14A of the Penang state constitution amended in 2012, provides that a member of the legislative assembly shall vacate his seat if having been elected as a candidate of a political party, he resigns or is expelled from or ceases to be a member of the party
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Wednesday, the Federal Court declared that Section 14A of the Penang state constitution was a valid law and constitutional in accordance with the Federal Constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Until the amendments to the Federal Constitution banning anti-hopping by individual MPs is gazetted, Section 14A of the Penang state constitution is valid and should be enforceable,” Lim said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Penang state legislative assembly tried to table a motion against Khaliq, Zolkifli, Zulkifli and Dr Afif to vacate their seats
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The four had filed a suit against the legislative assembly and state Speaker so the legislative assembly agreed to defer the tabling of the motion pending the disposal of the suit
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The four had challenged the constitutionality of Section 14A of the Penang state constitution so the state legislative assembly and state Speaker Datuk Law Choo Kiang posed a legal question to the Federal Court on whether Article 14A of the Penang state constitution is void for being inconsistent with Article 10(1)(c) of the Federal Constitution

                Kamal Salih said MIER had been an advocate of GST since 1988 because it believed in its merits
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I have concerns that MIER’s abandoning of GST in favour of HSST could damage its reputation,” he told FMT when commenting on the think tank’s proposal for a 10% HSST
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                MIER claimed that its proposed alternative would be more efficient than GST and would affect only the most important sectors of the economy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I’ve always said GST must be complemented by tax reforms such as a capital gains tax,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Exemptions and thresholds should be adhered to if GST is to work

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “But in the longer term, we need to seriously think about going back to GST, with improvements based on lessons learned from our first experience with it.” He noted that GST was recognised as an efficient indirect tax system by the European Economic Community, which has made it a prerequisite for any European country seeking to join it

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 1878, two European colonists signed a deal with the sultan’s for the use of his territory in present-day Malaysia – an agreement that independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the sultan descendants about US$1,000 (around RM5,300) a year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia did not participate in nor recognise the arbitration – allowing the heirs to present their case without rebuttal – despite warnings that it would be dangerous to ignore the process
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia disputes that, saying the sultanate ceded sovereignty and that the arbitration was illegitimate

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The arbitration is a sophisticated fiction, veiled as a legal process,” Uria Menendez, a Spanish law firm representing Malaysia, told Reuters
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The heirs rejected Thomas’ offer and the arbitration went on without Malaysia’s participation
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Stampa argued in his award statement that the courts did not have jurisdiction over arbitration, and moved the case to France to deliver the award – actions that Malaysia says were unlawful

                Like I said, it is unreasonable, if you want to equalise; we will equalise with the exception of local traders,” he said, adding that the impact on consumers and small traders will be huge should local businesses be spared from the taxation

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia is scrambling to protect its assets as the descendants of the last sultan of the remote Philippine region of Sulu look to enforce a U$15 billion (RM67 billion) arbitration award in a dispute over a colonial-era land deal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 1878, two European colonists signed a deal with the sultan for the use of his territory in present-day Malaysia – an agreement that independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the monarch's descendants about $1,000 (about RM5,000) a year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia disputes that, saying the sultanate ceded sovereignty and the arbitration was illegitimate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "The arbitration is a sophisticated fiction, veiled as a legal process," Uria Menendez, a Spanish law firm representing Malaysia, told Reuters
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The heirs rejected Thomas' offer and the arbitration went on without Malaysia's participation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Stampa argued in his award statement that the courts did not have jurisdiction over arbitration, and moved the case to France to deliver the award - actions that Malaysia says were unlawful

                “However, preliminary information received showed that the oil was produced by Indonesia itself,” he told a press conference after chairing a meeting of the task force to address inflation at Parliament building here

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Annuar, who chairs the task force, said he had asked the Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) to follow-up on the matter

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Recently, news on the discovery of thousands of packets of cooking oil in waters near Pulau Jawa, Indonesia, has been circulating on social media, raising questions among various parties
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Annuar also said the task force had discussed with the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), asking it to do a study on the pricing mechanism for cooking oil in the country

                "The task force was told that only 5.6% of oil supply produced by the country is for the domestic market and 60,000 tonnes of this is subsidised oil in packets,” he added

                Thomas, who held the office of AG between June 2018 and February 2020, said that in his capacity as public prosecutor, he had the discretion under Article 145 (3) of the Federal Constitution and Section 376 of the Criminal Procedure Code to prefer the three charges brought against N Sundra Rajoo
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sundra said he should not have faced prosecution as he enjoyed immunity for acts done as AIAC director, a contention which the Federal Court accepted in judicial review proceedings heard last year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The apex court said Sundra’s functional immunity included immunity from criminal proceedings and that he had acted to safeguard the interests of AIAC and its parent body, the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organisation (AALCO)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Thomas in his defence maintained that the immunity alleged by Sundra violated Article 8 of the constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Thomas also claimed that Sundra, who was the centre’s director since 2010, had included the immunity clause in 2013 which was self-serving, dishonest and constituted fraud
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                In a statement, MAP information chief Mathavan Velayutham also slammed the Seberang Perai City Council (MBSP) over its “ferocious” treatment of two cows that were seized as part of a routine operation to round up strays

                “Cow-herding is his family’s source of income

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that the 44-year-old cowherd was arrested and remanded for two days after pleading with city council officers to release the cattle

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Questioning why a two-day remand was necessary for such a petty issue, he said the magistrate should have just ordered police to take the man’s statement before immediately releasing him

                The plaintiffs, 1MDB and three of its subsidiaries, namely 1MDB Energy Holdings Ltd, 1MDB Energy Ltd and 1MDB Energy (Langat) Ltd, are represented by lawyers Rabindra S Nathan and Vanessa Thong Chon Yen

                1MDB, and its subsidiaries, 1MDB Energy Holdings Ltd, 1MDB Energy Ltd and 1MDB Energy (Langat) Ltd filed the application on Jan 28, seeking documents relating to the receipt and use of US$10,173,104 in funds by Red Granite Pictures and US$238 million by Red Granite Capital Ltd

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On May 7, 2021, 1MDB and its subsidiaries sued Riza and his two companies for allegedly receiving around US$248 million in funds that they misused for their personal gain, including financing a film and to purchase various properties
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They also claimed that since Riza managed both companies, he would know that the money originating from 1MDB had been misappropriated for their gain

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Riza in his defence claimed that the funds were obtained from a loan from the Saudi royal family or International Petroleum Investment Company and not from 1MDB, adding that it was hard for an unknown film producer to obtain loans from banks and that had compelled him to seek funds from individuals or companies

                “In the matter of Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA), which in fact introduced Jho Low to the Sultan, it was however insignificant, as there was no impropriety or corruption in this act, or of being acquainted with Jho Low,” she said in her witness statement

                When explaining her knowledge of Jho Low surrounding the founding of TIA, she said from her research, she knew that Jho Low had links to the royal family of Terengganu, which led to the founding of TIA and later renamed as 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Prior to 1MDB’s scandal rising to Malaysian public awareness in 2015, Jho Low himself had made it publicly known since 2010 of his involvement in the founding of TIA, through the Sultan of Terengganu

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She further said that Jho Low had links to members of the royal family of Terengganu and this was undisputed public knowledge, as he was friendly with members of that family back in 2009, and was introduced to the Sultan of Terengganu through its members, a fact that Jho Low himself had publicly admitted, without controversy
