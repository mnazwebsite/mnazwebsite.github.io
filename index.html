                The contractor had commenced its lawsuit against the government, transport minister Wee Ka Siong and two others in 2020, seeking to declare that the termination of its contract was illegal, unlawful and a violation of a settlement agreement both parties had previously entered into

                Taking over the leadership of Islamic Jihad in Egypt in 1993, Zawahiri was a leading figure in a campaign in the mid-1990s to overthrow the government and set up a purist Islamic state

                In 1999, an Egyptian military court sentenced Zawahiri to death in absentia

                Why does the Home Ministry need friends? In the official booklet published by the ministry, Hamzah was quoted saying that the programme seeks to raise awareness for the public to join KDN in carrying the responsibility to keep the country’s peace and security

                CCF officials inspect a shop with imported instant noodles and ice cream products for sale in Kampong Cham province on July 29

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The GDCE’s letter on July 29 informed the directors of the relevant branches and offices of the Customs and Excise department that recently the food safety authorities of some European Union (EU) countries have found that some instant noodles and ice cream brands originating from Thailand and Vietnam contained ethylene oxide residue, which the EU, US and the World Health Organisation (WHO) consider to be substances that pose cancer risks to consumers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                From August 1 onwards all imports of the instant noodles “Lucky Me!” made in Thailand, “Hao Hao” noodles made in Vietnam and “Haagen-Dazs” vanilla ice cream made in France must be accompanied by a certificate of ethylene oxide analysis from the food safety inspection authority of the exporting countries
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Director-General of the CCF Phan Oun, speaking to the The Post from abroad, said that after receiving the information about the ethylene oxide he assigned CCF branch officials to check all supermarkets, markets and small businesses across the country
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “After several days of research, our preliminary results are that no instant noodles or ice cream products as identified in the announcement have been found in the Cambodia market yet,” he said
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The inspections took place after the EU and the Asean Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (ARASFF) sounded the alarm about the presence of ethylene oxide in two instant noodle and one ice cream brands, which were then immediately recalled by the food safety authority of Singapore, kicking off the wider alarm about their distribution

                “Bukit Aman’s classified investigation unit (D5) took a statement from former AG, Apandi Ali, from 2.30pm to 3.45pm,” said police secretary Noorsiah Saaduddin in a statement

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Long before he led Selangor’s state government from March 13, 2008, to Sept 22, 2014, Khalid was already one of the most important men in the country’s history, mainly for his role in the dawn attack on the London Stock Exchange, which led to the successful takeover of Guthrie Corporation, a British-owned company
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khalid’s experience of working as a financial adviser in London had also helped ensure the success of the top-secret plan to pull off a “heist” on all Guthrie Corporation’s plantations on behalf of the country
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was also Amanah Saham Nasional Berhad (ASNB) director, Kumpulan Guthrie Bhd director, and Pelaburan Hartanah Nasional Berhad director
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The historic polls also saw the fall of the Barisan Nasional (BN) government in the state for the first time
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During his six-year tenure leading the Selangor government, Khalid had, among others, introduced the Hasil Negeri Untuk Rakyat (state’s revenue channelled back to the people) policy in 2008

                Earlier during the morning session, Cha Kee Chin (PH-Rasah) pointed out mistakes in the Malay language copy of the Bill, accusing the attorney-general of failing to heed Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s request to uphold the Malay language

                “I want to give some advice, maybe not to Mafi, but to the AGC because I see in the Malay version of the amendment, under Schedule 3 which lists all six livestock should be written in Malay
            </p>

                “The AGC, apparently, is not upholding what the prime minister has outlined, which was about our national language, and in the House, it is our responsibility to lift the national language together,” he told the Dewan Rakyat

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Malay copy of the amendment, sighted by Malay Mail, saw the third schedule list the lists of livestock in English, instead of Malay

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On top of the language, there was an error on one of the livestock listed, which spelt rabbit with an apostrophe sign at the end.

                However, last September, the French Arbitration court, without knowing the decision of the Madrid Court to cancel Stampa's appointment as an arbitrator, went ahead with the Sulu descendants' case against Malaysia

                Authorities in East Nusa Tenggara province began imposing an annual fee of 3.75 million rupiah (US$252 - RM1,121) to enter Komodo Island on Monday (August 1)

                "So with their interest, they will want to explore in more depth, and once they move to the secondary school level, they will not be afraid of such subjects," he said in a reply to a supplementary question from Ahmad Fadhli Shaari (PAS-Pasir Mas) during Question Time

                Ahmad Fadhli had asked the Education Ministry to state its strategies to boost interest among students on STEM-related subjects and courses to meet the demand of the country in the future

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 1 — After Malaysia’s chicken shortage a few months back, the chicken industry has stabilised thanks to several steps taken by the government, said Agriculture and Food Industries (Mafi) Minister Datuk Seri Ronald Kiandee
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “There was a slight disruption in the supply of chicken in the past few months
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                These steps taken by the government can be seen as a success and have stabilised the chicken industry in Malaysia,” he said in Parliament here
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said that the Malaysian chicken industry has been recovering so well that now Malaysia has an oversupply of chicken, causing the price of chicken locally to plummet lower than the ceiling price of chicken set by the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                LONDON -- England are your Women's Euro 2022 winners after a thrilling back-and-forth final against Germany on Sunday

                When the game went to extra time, it was another England sub, Chloe Kelly, who scored from close range after Germany failed to clear a corner

                The Bayern Munich player was named Germany's Player of the Year in 2021 and was the starting striker for their first game of the tournament; however, on Sunday she struggled to get into the game and was replaced by Nicole Anyomi after 67 minutes

                The first thought that sprang in me on reading Azhar's glowing garlanding of Muhyiddin as a "reformist" had me confused as to who is the "Don Quixote" (impractical idealist) - is it Muhyiddin or Azhar? Muhyiddin’s desperate look for a spot in the roundtable of peers is just a dream

                Zahid also spoke about Tengku Zafrul Aziz’s appointment as Selangor BN treasurer and said the appointment was Tengku Zafrul’s stepping stone to becoming a politician

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked if Tengku Zafrul would be a candidate at the next general election, Zahid said BN was looking for heavyweight candidates in Selangor but it did not necessarily have to be Tengku Zafrul

                “When an old, hegemonic party like Umno also understands the importance of creating new rules to protect democracy and the people’s mandate, it shows that a new political order has emerged,” said Johor DAP chairman Liew Chin Tong

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While commending Umno for supporting the bill, Liew said the party was new to the fight and pointed out that DAP had been fighting for such a law as far back as 1978

                It was only after the 2018 general election, “and after 15 MPs led by Larut MP Hamzah Zainudin jumped from Umno to Bersatu did Umno begin supporting the idea of an anti-hopping law”, he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The anti-hopping bill, in the form of an amendment to the Federal Constitution, received cross-party support in the Dewan Rakyat on Thursday, when it was approved by a two-thirds majority

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, four state governments have indicated they would adopt similar state legislation, law minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar said yesterday

                “How is he supposed to be a leader when he cannot understand a basic thing?” said Fahmi Fadzil, PKR’s information chief

                “Did he not read the (MoU) in full, or is he not understanding it on purpose due to certain reasons?” Fahmi said the MoU, signed between Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Pakatan Harapan (PH) leaders last year, said it would remain in effect until the day Parliament is dissolved

                However, Fahmi said the MoU stated that the agreement would not affect the opposition’s role in providing checks and balances on the government as well as ensuring that Putrajaya will be accountable to the Parliament and to the rakyat
