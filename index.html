                In a joint statement, the duo also lambasted the delay in declassifying the PH ordered forensic audit, and shared several excerpts from the Proceeding Report (Hansard) of the Public Account Committee (PAC) dated March 8, which they claim provides details of the audit results
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The Government Governance, Procurement and Finance Investigation Committee (JKSTUPKK) report was declassified yesterday but the forensic audit report and the former admiral of the Navy Tan Sri Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor's letter of reprimand have not yet been declassified
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “However, the findings of this forensic audit are also shocking,” they said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former ministers said that on Page 27 of the PAC proceedings report, Prabhat Kumar, the executive director of Alliance Investigative and Forensic Accounting, testified to the PAC that those involved had no intention to deliver the LCS project, but only had intentions to maximise their own gains
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On page 22, En Prabhat Kumar says that ‘It is clear that in the case of the LCS programme, Anuar bin Murad sidestepped the authority of all of his subordinates, and acted in a manner as if they were only two persons in the whole organisation’.” “It is an outright conflict of interest whereby Tan Sri Ramli is the chairman of the LCS Steering Committee and CAD, and at the same time also the Managing Director of BHIC,” they said.

                His comments were made in response to a government disclosure that the upcoming political funding bill could include a provision to prohibit donations to political parties from GLCs that have contracts with the government

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Political appointments to GLCs has become a common practice in Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For the record, some GLCs have been set up to meet public needs, and politicians, being representatives of the people, would be in a better position to ensure that those objectives are met

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Some have concluded that their move was in return for promises of cabinet posts or seats on the boards of GLCs

                Shortly after the formation of the Perikatan Nasional government in February 2020, four career politicians were appointed as head of GLCs

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, it becomes a problem when the GLCs are misused as a source of unlimited financing for politicians

                Hishammuddin said yesterday the ongoing construction of the first LCS (LCS 1), which was to have been delivered to the navy in 2019, will not involve new allocations from the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Lim noted that when Hishammuddin appeared before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Jan 25, he said Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) would have to deliver two LCS without any additional cost to the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Hishammuddin should explain why the defence ministry has reduced from two LCS to one LCS which must be completed and delivered by the contractor with no additional government funds,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his testimony before the PAC, Hishammuddin had said that if the government wanted to proceed with the project, “we cannot put all the money upfront if Boustead doesn’t commit to being able to deliver at least two ships”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the Hansard sighted by FMT, he said that completing the first two LCS “will not affect upfront payment” as they are “still under the contractual amount”

                The Human Resources Minister said the scheme to cover homemakers against injuries suffered while tending to their chores would be managed by the Social Security Organisation (Socso)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On July 26, the Dewan Rakyat passed the Housewives Social Security Bill (HSS), which allows husbands to voluntarily contribute to the scheme for their wives below the age of 55
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked if the definition of housewife would be widened to cover husbands who assume the role of homemakers as well, Saravanan said the ministry would need an in-depth study to see the number of house husbands involved
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “No action would be taken against any husband who did not contribute.” However, he noted that husbands who have signed up to contribute and failed to maintain it monthly would be fined RM10,000

                Saravanan also said the amendments passed in the Employment Insurance System Act 2017 (Act 800) and Employees’ Social Security Act 1969 (Act 4) to increase the maximum monthly salary ceiling limit from RM4,000 to RM5,000 would come into effect next month

                The statement by the police this evening follows the revelation by the victim, a student at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM), that it had been more than a year since she filed a report about it with the police and the university administration

                In a statement, the federation’s president Datuk Dr Syed Hussain Syed Husman said economic growth in the second half of this year is expected to slow to between 5% and 6%, compared with 8.9% reported in the second quarter

                He added that some employers were already struggling to fully implement the new minimum wage of RM1,500 per month that took effect in May, which was estimated to cost them an additional RM14 billion per year

                He added that employers will find it very difficult to absorb the additional RM110.99 billion cost per year, as supply chain issues from the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war continue to rock the global markets

                According to the report, this came two days after Ahmad Zahid received a letter from BNS on July 8, 2011 recommending the selection of the Gowind design, before BNS issued a letter of intent to French subcontractor company DCNS on July 13, 2011 to begin the concept design and design evaluation process
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The report found that BNS was determined to choose the Gowind design because it had held prior discussions and negotiations with DCNS to carry out the construction of the LCS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This can be proved when BNS issued a Letter of Intent to DCNS on July 13, 2011, two days after (then) defence minister, Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, expressed his agreement with BNS’ recommendation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In fact, BNS also started the Conceptual Design process with DCNS on July 25, 2011, which was before the original Letter of Acceptance (SST) was issued on December 16, 2011
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This happened during the Analysis on the BNS Evaluation for MS to RMN on July 11, 2011
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, MoF on December 21, 2011 only agreed to approve an advance payment of RM500 million to BNS

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Why?” The special independent committee was formed by the PH government to coordinate overall policies and the management of foreign workers

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The committee was then tasked with travelling around the country to gain insights on the hiring of foreign workers and to make recommendations to the government in a report that – according to former human resources minister M Kula Segaran – was to be made public

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Kula had previously called for the report to be made public in June 2020, when Perikatan Nasional was in power

                In a statement, he said he submitted the independent report to the Cabinet which contained proposals that would have made the management of foreign workers transparent

                Jasin OCPD Deputy Supt Mispani Hamdan said the elderly couple was walking along the street at about 11.30am on Tuesday (Aug 16), when an ongoing car hit them, causing them to be tossed into the air

                DSP Mispani said the driver of the car was heading towards the Jasin market while the couple was walking towards a row of shophouses in the opposite direction

                Gomez, who resigned from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s consultation and corruption prevention panel last year, told FMT he suspected that politicians receiving stipends or salaries from GLCs would channel some of the money to their parties

                He said farmers have now limited chicken production to meet only domestic demand following the export ban on whole chicken from June 1
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The talk that the export ban would be lifted has placed them in a quandary as “most farmers are afraid to raise chickens at this time because they don’t want to have excess poultry”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The government has provided no answers on how long the ban will be in place
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lamenting the lack of information and slow decision-making by the government, he called on Putrajaya to provide clarification on the export ban as soon as possible or risk causing further damage to the poultry industry
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Exports of whole chicken have been banned since June 1 to stem the chicken shortage, but confusion arose when later that month, Putrajaya eased the ban, allowing poultry importers abroad to resume getting live premium chickens from Malaysia

                "This is my responsibility to present the matter to the Cabinet on Wednesday and I will do it

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said this in his reply to several members of the Dewan Negara on Wednesday, who urged the government to establish an RCI to investigate the LCS project to examine all aspects so that no guilty party escapes prosecution

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hishammuddin also explained that there would not be additional provisions for the six-month period of the mobilisation process and there was no need for the project to be continued by other companies because it would further delay the project

                Regarding the LCS forensic audit report, he said that the Cabinet was waiting for the response of the Attorney General's Chambers and the National Audit Department since the forensic audit was owned by BNS and not the government

                In an interview on Monday (Aug 14) with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, Wong said the relationship between the world’s biggest economies was on a "very worrying” trajectory in the wake of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and China’s subsequent military drills around the island

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "As they say, no one deliberately wants to go into battle, but we sleepwalk into conflict,” he added

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "And that’s the biggest problem and danger.” Wong expressed concern about a potential accident in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea, citing a 2001 incident when an American spy plane made an emergency landing on China’s southern Hainan Island after colliding with a Chinese jet
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A city-state dependent on trade, Singapore supports a strong American presence in Asia by allowing the US to access military facilities while also counting China as its top trading partner

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The White House has sought to keep the relationship from deteriorating further, emphasising that Congress is an independent branch of government and that there was no change to the US’s "One China” policy

                In a statement, the party's committee member Lim Wei Jiet said that none of the companies to which Ahmad Ramli was charged with channelling payments without the company's approval, was explicitly mentioned in the PAC report

                In its report released on August 8, Parliament's bipartisan watchdog Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said BNS was awarded a RM9.128 billion 10-year contract from 2013 to 2023 for the supply of the six LCS

                the rent here is (also) cheap compared with other locations," he said here on Tuesday (Aug 16), adding that he hoped that the mall management will carry out more promotional activities as there are still people who are unaware of the existence of the mall

                Noorasyikin Shafie, 24, whose company Iiman Empire just started operating here six months ago, concurred that foot traffic to Mara Digital Mall, which is located on the third floor of the building, is comparatively low compared to the lower levels
