            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                PKR information chief Fahmi Fadzil asked why Najib did not take up the concerns expressed by then navy chief Abdul Aziz Jaafar about the littoral combat ship project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The project entails the construction of six corvette-class ships for the Royal Malaysian Navy, with the first ship due for delivery this month
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib said the project was only resumed by the current government in April
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Maybe the navy would have already got the much-needed littoral combat ships.” A report by the PAC on Thursday said the defence ministry and contractor Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd had ignored the navy’s views on the project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The PAC report said Aziz had testified that he wrote two letters to Najib, five letters to the defence minister, 10 to the ministry’s secretary-general, and one each to the secretary-general of the Treasury, and chief secretary to the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib said earlier the project had been investigated by a government committee in 2018, when PH was in power, and by the police after BNS lodged a police report in December 2020

                However, MIC had to take action considering that the video of the incident has gone viral on social media,” said MIC secretary-general Rajasekaran Thiyagarajan in a statement

                The assembly members had filed a suit against the state legislative assembly and state assembly speaker to prevent their seats from being vacated under a state constitutional provision against party-hopping

                “We will follow whatever is applicable based on the unanimous decision of the Federal Court that Article 14A of the Penang state constitution is valid, constitutional and should remain as it is,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Separately, the Penang state assembly and the speaker then posed a legal question to the Federal Court on whether Article 14A was void for being inconsistent with the Federal Constitution

                He refuted US disinformation on China's response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wang dismissed Washington's accusations that China was attempting to change the status quo across the Taiwan Straits as a complete slander,saying it is the US and the Taiwan separatist forces that have broken the status quo
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wang cited the China-US Joint Communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations released in 1978 as saying the US "recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China" and "acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China"

                It is the US that is changing the status quo and hollowing out the one-China policy, he added

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wang also lashed out at Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party for pushing for "incremental independence", engaging in "de-sinicization" and creating " two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" on various occasions

                Gobi Krishnan, who was reportedly sacked from his position in Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu), has urged the party president and leadership to step in over the issue of his removal

                Gobi Krishnan, who is the associate members' wing information chief, also continued to slam the newly appointed associate member’s wing leader, Dr Chong Fat Full, over his sacking

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This is needed, especially since party grassroots nationwide are increasingly questioning Dr Chong’s actions which seem to be opposing the party’s constitution,” said Gobi Krishnan in a statement on Saturday (Aug 6)
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 6 — The statement by Prime Minister’s Special Envoy to China Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing on US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s controversial visit to Taiwan does not reflect the Foreign Ministry’s stand, said Datuk Seri Saifuddin Abdullah

                Local media reported that Tiong in a statement yesterday had condemned Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan as it had added fuel to instability in the region

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was reported saying that Pelosi’s visit was a violation of the One China principle and the Three Joint Communiqués that underline the establishment of relations between the US and China

                Tensions between China and the United States heightened after Pelosi arrived in Taiwan on Tuesday

                Taking to Facebook, Najib called out several quarters for their criticisms and proposed solutions to the troubled project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He suggested the project be stopped completely

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This, after RM6 billion had been spent and with the project being 60% complete,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Instead, Najib said, the best way forward was to re-evaluate and control the cost and progress of the project more carefully so that the ships could be completed and delivered
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He then questioned the opposition for trying to pin the blame on him now over the problems afflicting the LCS project

                “I have never been under investigation or called to give a statement to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).” He then highlighted that the project had been investigated by a government committee in 2018, when Pakatan Harapan (PH) was in power, and by the police after Boustead Naval Shipyard lodged a police report in December 2020

                The products under the latest recall are the 100ml version of the brand's Belgian Chocolate ice cream, which expires on June 8, 2023, and the 473ml version of its Cookies & Cream ice cream, which expires on May 27 next year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Wednesday (Aug 3), the Malaysian Immigration Authorities Association and Peninsular Malaysia Immigration Service Union released statements on the incident, with alleged accounts of the incident making the rounds on social media
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Both associations were critical of the incident
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The KLIA Immigration Operations head was said to have been at the receiving end because there were no Immigration officers stationed at the VIP lane between 8.40am and 9.40am on Wednesday (Aug 3)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Public Service Department (PSD) meanwhile dismissed claims that its director-general publicly berated an Immigration officer in public and described such allegations as baseless and maliciously intended to tarnish his image as a high-ranking government official.

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Calvin, her eldest son, had been in an accident, and the mother-of-five's first instinct was to rush to the hospital

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Stadium Merdeka is where the independence of then-Malaya was declared in 1957 and where Malaysia's formation was proclaimed in 1963

                Instead, they will take the lift and come out at the third floor of the upcoming new mall at the base of the Merdeka 118 tower

                About Us Advertise WASHINGTON, Aug 6 — The scale of China’s military and political response to a visit to Taiwan by the top US lawmaker suggests the latest downturn in relations between the two superpowers could be deep and long-lasting, analysts say

                But the suspension yesterday of bilateral military and maritime dialogue while China continues its military exercises was “particularly worrisome,” she said

                Prolonged tension But others say that, as in the previous 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, when both China and the US made strong shows of military muscle, the current tensions could fade over time

                Yoon was the only leader not to meet Pelosi in person during her high-stakes Asia trip, which included becoming the highest-level US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years, as well as the first sitting House speaker to visit South Korea in about 20 years

                Malaysia's inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, increased 3.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) in June, led by costlier food, the Department of Statistics Malaysia said on July 22

                For 2021, BNM said in a statement on Feb 11 that Malaysia's GDP grew 3.1% from a year earlier following a 3.6% y-o-y GDP expansion in 4Q21

                Lawyer S Saravana Kumar submitted that the company had met all conditions imposed and, as such, the finance minister’s decision to reject the application was erroneous in law

                The company undertook a hydroelectric power plant in Kapit and had applied for the RM10.9 billion tax incentive in the form of an investment allowance spent on the power plant

                The lawyer said this was the first case of its kind where the finance minister’s refusal to grant a tax incentive was successfully challenged by the taxpayer, and one that involved a multi-billion ringgit tax incentive claim

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 5 — Rafizi Ramli has reportedly said he plans to contest in the Pandan seat that he previously held, replacing Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who won it in 2018
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For the time being, it is safe to say I should be able to contest in Pandan,” Rafizi was quoted saying by The Malaysian Insight
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For PKR, by the end of August, the framework and process for candidate selection will be finalised
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If we have not settled the candidates by September, we will be in trouble,” said Rafizi, in reference to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri's recent remark that GE15 is close
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rafizi also stressed his faith in PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as the best prime minister candidate for PH, as he is currently the most prominent figure in the coalition

                Donal Crotty, chairman of the Irish Chamber of Commerce Malaysia, said it appeared that the government had no “real commitment” to the programme, and Center for Market Education CEO Carmelo Ferlito said Putrajaya had sent a message that it sought to attract only people of high net worth

                The MM2H programme is aimed at drawing foreigners for long-term stay in Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, home minister Hamzah Zainudin told the Dewan Rakyat that 1,461 people applied to withdraw from the programme between September last year and June this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hamzah claimed that the withdrawals were not due to the new conditions the government had set

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Crotty said the MM2H was originally built on trust, confidence and security, and the government’s policy changes were detrimental to the programme

                Tengku Zafrul said that while he is confident that Malaysia will have positive economic growth at least until the third quarter of this year, the country must be prepared for a slowdown in the global economy

                "We are an open economy, trade to GDP is 120 per cent,” he said in reference to Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) being highly dependent on international trade, during a live interview with CNN last night

                In a circular last month, Bank Negara Malaysia projected the country’s inflation rates to remain between 2.2 to 3.2 per cent this year

                Last month, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)said the outlook for the global economy had “darkened significantly” since April and she could not rule out a possible global recession next year given the elevated risks

                “In the matter of Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA), which in fact introduced Jho Low to the Sultan, it was however insignificant, as there was no impropriety or corruption in this act, or of being acquainted with Jho Low,” she said in her witness statement

                When explaining her knowledge of Jho Low surrounding the founding of TIA, she said from her research, she knew that Jho Low had links to the royal family of Terengganu, which led to the founding of TIA and later renamed as 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Prior to 1MDB’s scandal rising to Malaysian public awareness in 2015, Jho Low himself had made it publicly known since 2010 of his involvement in the founding of TIA, through the Sultan of Terengganu

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She further said that Jho Low had links to members of the royal family of Terengganu and this was undisputed public knowledge, as he was friendly with members of that family back in 2009, and was introduced to the Sultan of Terengganu through its members, a fact that Jho Low himself had publicly admitted, without controversy

                “It was also important to know how Jho Low (prior to becoming publicised as a ‘playboy’ or having the ability to abuse positions of trust and power) first became involved in TIA in 2009 and obtained the role of special advisor to the Sultan of Terengganu
