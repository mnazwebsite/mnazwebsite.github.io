                Speaking to reporters after an event in Kuala Lumpur, Ismail said Umno had decided against extending the MoU and as such he would abide by his party’s decision

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said he had met with opposition leaders and told them that it did not matter if the MoU was extended or not

                Ismail said he had informed Umno that the government would not be extending the MoU, and that the opposition also agreed there was no need for another written agreement

                “With or without an agreement, we will continue (to cooperate) on matters that are important to the people and that we agree on.” Last September, Ismail and PH leaders signed the MoU agreeing to work together to help bolster economic recovery and restore political stability while the government managed the Covid-19 pandemic

                Thomas, who was formerly an attorney-general of Malaysia, also said Malaysia should seek to stop a private company from funding the Sulu claimants' multi-million dollar efforts to pursue the enforcement of the US$14.9 billion arbitration award
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Without mincing his words, Thomas labelled both the arbitrator Stampa and the Sulu claimants' lawyer Cohen as "enemies of Malaysia in the war of litigation they have unleashed against Malaysia" and said the country must stand united to repel such attacks
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saying that the eight Sulu claimants themselves would not have the legal expertise to engage in the litigation war against Malaysia, Thomas described Stampa and Cohen as allegedly being the "legal masterminds who have personal and direct responsibility in attacking Malaysia"
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Thomas said Malaysia should also seek court orders in the courts of Spain and France to stop both Stampa and Cohen from acting directly or indirectly on the Sulu claimants' purported arbitrations against Malaysia in any part of the world

                With the formation of Malaysia in 1963, Malaysia then continued making such annual payments and without interruption until 2013
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Thomas said the Sulu claimants are not entitled at all to make such an argument over what Sabah is worth now in 2022, as the Sulu sultan had already given away Sabah when he signed the 1878 documents and no longer owns these lands
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Thomas also alleged that the Spanish arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa — whose appointment as arbitrator had been challenged by Malaysia — was a “rogue” arbitrator who had “rewrote” the 1878 document when deciding on February 28, 2022 to order Malaysia to pay US$14.9 billion to the eight Sulu claimants
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Even while disputing the entire arbitration, Thomas also said the US$14.9 billion award was made against the government of Malaysia and which means only Malaysia’s assets can be subject to execution
            </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The award does not bind Petronas, and cannot be enforced against the assets of Petronas,” Thomas said of the US$14.9 billion award

                The Klang MP said this was evident from the High Court’s dismissal of a defamation suit filed by Apandi against DAP veteran Lim Kit Siang
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Apandi had sued Lim for claiming that he had abused his power to cover up the probe into 1MDB and the money that was transferred into former prime minister Najib Razak’s account
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib has maintained that the money transferred into his account was a political donation from the Saudi Arabian royal family
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “In her judgment, High Court judge Azimah Omar noted that Apandi’s delegation did not even meet nor speak to the alleged donor despite saying otherwise at a media conference on Jan 26, 2016,” Santiago told reporters after lodging a report against Apandi at the Klang Selatan police station today
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “He then proceeded to clear Najib of any wrongdoing, confirming that the RM42 million in Najib’s account was a donation from a Saudi prince.” He said this proved that Apandi’s claim in 2016 was a “blatant lie”

                “I lodged the police report so that investigations can commence against Apandi in this matter.” Najib was previously convicted by the High Court in the SRC International case and was sentenced to a 12-year jail term and fined RM210 million

                Azli had told the court last month that what Zarul asked him and Ibrahim to process from 2012 to 2017 were bribes to Lim

                Today, Zarul said he knew that using fake payment vouchers and invoices was a criminal offence

                Lim is standing trial on charges of using his position as then Penang chief minister to ask Zarul for a 10% cut of the profits from the undersea tunnel project and accepting RM3.3 million in kickbacks from the businessman

                Zarul also told the court that Lim instructed him to give statements to the media, after Zarul was released from Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) detention

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court had heard that between 2013 and 2014, Zarul paid a total of RM200,000 to Lim to “fulfil” part of his promise to give him a 10% cut of the project’s profits

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 -- The highly controversial Independent Police Conduct Commission (IPCC) Bill 2020 has been passed in Parliament after being tabled by Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainuddin for its second reading today

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The IPCMC Bill had proposed that "the Commission may initiate investigations notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the Commission may commence an investigation on its own initiative but only if the Commission is satisfied that the subject matter of the investigation is of significant interest to the public or that it is in the public interest to do so whether or not there is a complaint of misconduct relating to it”

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Other recommendations removed under the IPCC include suggested disciplinary jurisdiction over any misconduct committed by any member of the police force and the powers to exercise disciplinary jurisdiction over any complaint concerning the misconduct of any member of the police force
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It added that the IPCC will further weaken the already inadequate oversight mechanism, the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission (EAIC), when Malaysia is in desperate need of an independent commission overseeing the police.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 — Kashturi Patto (Batu Kawan-PH) was ejected from Dewan Rakyat after she repeatedly challenged Deputy Speaker Datuk Rashid Hasnon over his ruling on Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman’s (Pasir Salak-BN) remarks from last week

                Kashturi earlier asked about her letter to the Speaker regarding an alleged sexist remark Tajuddin said off-microphone when debating the Anti-Sexual Harrasment Bill on July 20, and Rashid said today that he already took action

                Nunukan Immigration officer Lukie Reza Kusumah said that their investigations have begun to see if the three foreigners had violated Indonesia's immigration law under Article 122 for abusing their visit pass to carry out business

                In the video, Khuzaimie explained that he was on his way to work the morning before when he was stopped by the elderly woman around Puchong area who asked for his help in getting her back home

                Najib said he would not want to comment on this issue as the application is now pending before the Federal Court

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Up until yesterday, Shafee had been representing Najib in all stages of the SRC case, including the trial at the High Court and the appeal at the Court of Appeal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After being found guilty at the High Court in July 2020 and losing his appeal at the Court of Appeal in December 2021, Najib had on December 8, 2021 filed his final appeal in the SRC case at the Federal Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The abrupt change in Najib's legal team comes exactly three weeks before August 15, which is when the Federal Court was scheduled to begin hearing his final appeal against his conviction in the SRC case
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As early as April 29, the Federal Court had already notified both Najib's lawyers and the prosecution that it would be hearing the SRC appeal over 10 days from August 15 to August 19, and from August 22 to August 26
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The law firm said that this was due to a completely new legal team taking over Najib's SRC case, and asked the Federal Court for an urgent case management on this case

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Judge Datuk Akhtar Tahir dismissed the application on grounds that there were no special circumstances for the court to grant a stay of execution of the judgment as by  the defendants

                He said the concern by the defendants that the money could not be refunded by the youth if they  won in their appeal at the Court of Appeal was not a special circumstance that justified the court granting a stay of execution of the judgment

            <p> </p>

                In submitting a memorandum on the issue to the home ministry, outside the Parliament building, the PKR-backed group said 68% of commercial crimes since May 2020 involved online scams

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                PKR central leadership council member Lee Chean Chung said that the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp in Singapore had given RM44.4 million in goodwill payouts to around 790 scam victims early this year
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “There have been cases where the bank was supposed to alert the victim about several irregular transactions, but did not do so because it was a public holiday,” he said at a press conference

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saying Bank Negara Malaysia’s monitoring of commercial banks was too weak, the group urged the central bank to ensure that financial institutions took more responsibility for financial scams

                Khairy said that the disruption of supply was due to the total lockdown in China where most of the supply for active ingredients for pharmaceutical products are produced and the Russia-Ukraine war where an ingredient which is added to the active ingredient was produced

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To ensure the country's drug security and self-reliance in times of crisis, local pharmaceutical companies are encouraged to produce their own active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) through public-private partnerships

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In addition to that, Khairy added that the ministry would also advocate pharmaceutical product patency by strengthening its cooperation with the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia to prevent patent ever-greening

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 — Any party or person with the view that a new agreement should be drawn up to replace the 1963 Malaysia Agreement (MA63) has a distorted view of the country’s national struggle, said Datuk Seri Maximus Ongkili

                Replying to a query from Datuk Mohd Azis Jamman (Warisan-Sepanggar), the minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Sabah and Sarawak Affairs) said that the government is committed to fully implementing the conditions set in MA63, as the document was sacred and laid the foundation of the formation of Malaysia

                Noting that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a “devastating impact” on the global economy, Salleh said it had resulted in a significant decrease in demand for goods and services in the local market
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Large investments from GLCs can help increase spending and demand, thus increasing the income of households and businesses – as well as generating more tax revenue for the government.” Salleh, who is the Usukan assemblyman, also highlighted the decrease in foreign direct investment during the pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In March 2021, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) said the country recorded RM13.9 billion in net foreign investment in 2020 – a 56% drop from the RM31.7 billion recorded in 2019
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “There has to be an increase in domestic direct investment to compensate for the lack of foreign direct investment,” said Salleh
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “GLCs can play an important role in this.” He added that investment in sectors that had been badly affected by the pandemic, such as tourism, could help stimulate the sector and prevent some firms from going out of business
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Salleh also said increased domestic investment by GLCs was especially needed considering the government’s limited financial capacity, something, he noted, that was not unique to Malaysia

                I used to worry whether my ex-husband was beating and torturing them like he used to do to me.” It is the latest case in multi-ethnic Malaysia of a so-called “unilateral conversion” to Islam — one parent converting a child’s religion without the other’s permission
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Loh said those who sided with her ex-husband’s decision to convert the children from Hinduism to Islam, and sought to keep them separated from her, were not respecting the top court’s decision
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “They are stopping their children from being with their mother.” Loh has a mixed background, with an ethnic Chinese father and ethnic Indian mother
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While she was recovering from her injuries, Loh claims her husband took the children
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “It is all about power and control.” Loh’s saga is not over, with her lawyers challenging the children’s conversion to Islam in court, arguing it was unconstitutional
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The influential Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party — an Islamist group that forms part of the national government — urged Loh not to challenge the conversion

                Puad Zarkashi said the RoS promised to inform the party on the status of the application by July 16

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If the amendment is approved, Umno will be allowed to postpone its party elections by up to six months after a general election or up to 18 months from the end of its leadership’s term, whichever comes later
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Puad said the RoS had tarnished its credibility by taking so much time on a simple matter  “RoS has no right to dictate an organisation or political party’s constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This is the right of any registered organisation,” he said, adding Umno had followed the book in amending its constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This is not about Umno wanting to postpone polls, this is about Umno amending its constitution

                If other parties can get a response (to their application) within a week, why does Umno have to wait so long

                In a statement last night, the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) confirmed that the wanted Malaysian was currently under the custody of Thai authorities
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, Thai media quoted the country’s national police assistant chief Pol Lt-Gen Surachate Hakparn as saying that Teow, who is also wanted in China and Thailand, was expected to be deported to China today
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the Chinese embassy in Thailand was facilitating the extradition
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “With cooperation from the Malaysian police, we brought the boat back to our shore,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Teow founded the MBI Group and operated entertainment complexes, including a resort in Danok at the Thailand-Malaysia border, as well as built a business empire from online investment schemes attracting investors from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Macau

                In 2018, Malaysian authorities charged Teow with financial crime and his assets were seized for his alleged connection to a pyramid scheme, but he fled to Thailand last year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “No such money was given to me as political funding or to me personally,’’ he added

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former minister was responding to UKSB administrative manager David Tan Siong Sun’s allegation during cross examination, in the former deputy prime minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi trial Mon, that he (Chan) had accepted political funding amounting to RM7,856,920 from the company

                Chan said Tan’s claims were highly malicious and hence the matter has been referred to his lawyers given his (Chan’s) name has been tarnished with the allegation

                Leadership contender says he will close 30 Mandarin teaching programmes to restrain Beijing’s soft power China is the biggest long-term threat to Britain, Rishi Sunak will say on Monday as he unveils plans to curb the country’s soft power by closing all of its 30 Confucius Institutes, which promote the teaching of Chinese language and culture, in the UK

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It said Sunak had a “pragmatic view of developing balanced ties with China”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In an attempt to move the focus in the Tory leadership race on to national security and international affairs, Sunak is expected to say on Monday that China “is the biggest-long-term threat to Britain and the world’s economic and national security”, citing the views of the director general of MI5 and head of the FBI

                They are effectively joint ventures between a host university, a partner university in China, and the Chinese International Education Foundation (CIEF), a Beijing-based organisation

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sunak’s remarks on Confucius Institute are likely to contrast with Truss, who oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding between University College London’s education faculty and Hanban – an agency under China’s education ministry that used to be a partner in the scheme – when she was an education minister in 2014

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The noticeboard also displayed a picture suggesting a high-rise office building and a condominium will be built on the land

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is understood that the proposed development plan involves land with a water sewage facility

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 — Lawyer Gobind Singh Deo today challenged the validity of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) investigation on Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman after an investigator appeared ignorant of basic facts relevant to his fraud trial
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nurul could not recall when she spoke to Syed Saddiq’s father or name the officer who was in charge of speaking to Syed Saddiq during the investigation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She also disagreed with Gobind that during an election, money could be advanced and reimbursed later despite being shown several related payments
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As Gobind maintained the line of questioning, Nurul Hidayah began repeating her previous answers regardless of the question
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During cross examination earlier today, Nurul insisted that RM100,000 from this went from Maybank Islamic Bhd account belonging to Armada Bumi Bersatu Enterprise (ABBE) into Syed Saddiq’s personal bank account in two payments of RM50,000
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Syed Saddiq also faces two counts of engaging in money laundering activities, namely two transactions of RM50,000, believed to be proceeds of unlawful activities, from his Maybank Islamic Bhd account into his Amanah Saham Bumiputera account, on June 16 and 19, 2018

                Shahril was among the latest to be implicated today by UKSB executives testifying against Ahmad Zahid, joining others such as Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin and former prime ministers Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under questioning from the defence, UKSB administrative manager David Tan Siong Sun told the High Court this morning that Shahril received a total of RM1.16 million for political funding purposes by virtue of being a close ally of Khairy

                Tan referred to Shahril as “S Pat” in his ledger, which was shown to the court today

                Ahmad Zahid is facing 33 charges of receiving bribes amounting to S$13.56 million (RM42 million) from UKSB as an inducement for himself in his capacity as a civil servant and the then home minister to extend the contract of the company as the operator of the OSCs in China and the VLN system as well as to maintain the agreement to supply VLN integrated system paraphernalia to the same company by the Home Ministry
