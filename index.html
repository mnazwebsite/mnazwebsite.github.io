                Thaksin, 73, was Thailand’s prime minister from 2001 to 2006, while Yingluck was the first Thai female prime minister, serving from 2011 to 2014

            <p>
                In a Facebook post yesterday, Yingluck who is here with her brother and also exiled former Thai premier Thaksin, revealed that it was her second visit to Penang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Came to Penang for the second time after a long time

            <p>
                Yingluck, 55, said Penang has a similar vibe to Phuket island
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thaksin, 73, was Thailand’s prime minister from 2001 to 2006, while Yingluck was the first Thai female prime minister, serving from 2011 to 2014

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mbappe opened the scoring with another stunning goal before Giroud, who again showed coach Didier Deschamps he is more than a third-choice forward, sealed the world champions' win with a header
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mbappe fired a shot into the top corner in the second minute, but the effort was disallowed for offside
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If I call him, it's so he can score goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I did not say that he would be there

                Bastoni’s current deal runs out in the summer of 2024, meaning he could decide to start running it down

            <p>
                Bastoni fits perfectly as the left-sided centre-back in Conte’s back-three system

                Premier League • England Talk of Inter Milan centre-back Alessandro Bastoni joining Tottenham has once again intensified following events over last weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And now, following events on Sunday, Tottenham are once again being linked with Bastoni
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It was the 23-year-old Italian centre-back’s first booking of the Serie A season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bastoni’s current deal runs out in the summer of 2024, meaning he could decide to start running it down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bastoni fits perfectly as the left-sided centre-back in Conte’s back-three system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spurs are back in Premier League action on Saturday October 1 when they head to Arsenal
            </p>

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Sept 22 — The Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) plans to establish a university that specifically caters for women, which indirectly would increase Malaysia’s visibility in higher education and further strengthen its position as an international higher education hub

            <p>
                Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Noraini Ahmad said currently the number of women enrolled in local public higher education institutions is more than 350,000 which constitutes 61 per cent of the overall student enrolment, while more than 530,000, which is 53 per cent of female students, are enrolled in local private higher education institutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noraini added that in the QS World University Rankings (WUR) 2023, there is only one local university listed in the top 100 and four out of five local research universities are listed in the top 200
            </p>

                After hearing arguments from both the prosecution and Zahid’s lawyer, High Court judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah decided that the prosecution could start impeachment proceedings against Zahid’s third defence witness Jefri Jamil

            <p>

                "I only have S$160 worth of credit in my account – if I want to use the voucher for travel to any of these destinations, I will have to fork out more money." She added that she was very disappointed at the move to change the expiry date of her credit as this meant she would not be able to fully utilise the credit for future trips.  Low tried raising the matter with AVA, AirAsia's chat line, and finally managed to get in touch with three agents

            <p>
                However, she has yet to receive an explanation for why her credit expiry date was changed without her knowledge.  Another Malaysian passenger, Fara Adilla, was told that she could not redeem the full value of her voucher amounting to RM3,728.92

                Rodel Dumasig Jardin, a passenger from the Philippines, is still holding out for a refund after AirAsia cancelled his flight in May.  Rodel had bought 12 round-trip tickets in four bookings for domestic flights from Clark to Tacloban, paying a total of US$1,107.  The flights were scheduled to depart between April 8 and May 18

                "I only have S$160 worth of credit in my account – if I want to use the voucher for travel to any of these destinations, I will have to fork out more money." She added that she was very disappointed at the move to change the expiry date of her credit as this meant she would not be able to fully utilise the credit for future trips.  Low tried raising the matter with AVA, AirAsia's chat line, and finally managed to get in touch with three agents

                However, she has yet to receive an explanation for why her credit expiry date was changed without her knowledge.  Another Malaysian passenger, Fara Adilla, was told that she could not redeem the full value of her voucher amounting to RM3,728.92

            <p>
                Fara, who plans to go on holiday in Seoul next May, considers herself fortunate that her travel destination is on AirAsia's list of permitted locations.  However, the voucher can only be used to cover the basic fare

                Rodel Dumasig Jardin, a passenger from the Philippines, is still holding out for a refund after AirAsia cancelled his flight in May.  Rodel had bought 12 round-trip tickets in four bookings for domestic flights from Clark to Tacloban, paying a total of US$1,107.  The flights were scheduled to depart between April 8 and May 18

                The Perak police chief said the remains, which were found near a piece of an excavator on Wednesday at about 2.40pm, would be examined at the Raja Permaisuri Bainun Hospital forensics unit and have a DNA test conducted to identify the victim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We believe the victim was trapped and buried inside the excavator," he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was reported that the search and rescue operation on Tuesday (Sept 20) had found two excavators that were buried in the March 8 incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the incident, two quarry workers, identified as Itam Lasoh, 43, and Kheow Loo Siew Soon, 49, were buried under a pile of rocks

                The English Football Association (FA) said on Wednesday families of migrant workers in Qatar who were injured or killed while constructing the infrastructure for this year's World Cup should be compensated

                Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and FairSquare said on Tuesday FIFA's partners and World Cup sponsors must urge world football's governing body and the Qatari government to compensate migrant workers

                "Again, we are pushing FIFA for an update on the compensation fund which has been consistently referenced as a safety net where workers and their families have been unable to secure compensation from the construction companies." The government of Qatar has said that its labour system is still a work in progress, but denied a 2021 Amnesty report that thousands of migrant workers were still being exploited
            </p>

                Bullingham said the FA was also lobbying FIFA for an update on new labour protection laws in the Gulf state and the introduction of a centre to provide advice and help for migrant workers

                As I said, it is from a low base but if you speak to some of the NGOs on the ground, they now say that their construction sites would have the same health and safety regimes as Western sites." England captain Harry Kane and captains of seven other European nations who have qualified for the World Cup will wear an anti-discrimination armband during the tournament in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal

                Research in economics and finance over the decades established that the strongest predictors of an imminent speculative attack on a currency are the behaviour of the home country’s international reserves, the real exchange rate, domestic credit, credit of the public sector, and domestic inflation
