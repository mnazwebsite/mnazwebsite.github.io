                In a statement, MAP information chief Mathavan Velayutham also slammed the Seberang Perai City Council (MBSP) over its “ferocious” treatment of two cows that were seized as part of a routine operation to round up strays
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                “Cow-herding is his family’s source of income

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that the 44-year-old cowherd was arrested and remanded for two days after pleading with city council officers to release the cattle

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Questioning why a two-day remand was necessary for such a petty issue, he said the magistrate should have just ordered police to take the man’s statement before immediately releasing him

                Ramkarpal Singh said the autopsy report would help determine how Kim Shih Keat died on June 28

                “If we cannot establish the cause of death, then an inquest should be held,” Ramkarpal, who is also the Bukit Gelugor MP, said at a press conference

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ramkarpal said he had written to the coroner in Johor two days ago for an update on whether an inquest would be held

                The contractor and his two workers were involved in renovation work on her Section 3, Shah Alam house

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 1878, two European colonists signed a deal with the sultan for the use of his territory in present-day Malaysia – an agreement that independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the sultan descendants about US$1,000 (around RM5,300) a year

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia did not participate in nor recognise the arbitration – allowing the heirs to present their case without rebuttal – despite warnings that it would be dangerous to ignore the process
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia disputes that, saying the sultanate ceded sovereignty and that the arbitration was illegitimate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The arbitration is a sophisticated fiction, veiled as a legal process,” Uria Menendez, a Spanish law firm representing Malaysia, told Reuters
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The heirs rejected Thomas’ offer and the arbitration went on without Malaysia’s participation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Stampa argued in his award statement that the courts did not have jurisdiction over arbitration, and moved the case to France to deliver the award – actions that Malaysia says were unlawful

                The duo said the procurement of six LCS which was carried out through direct negotiations with a contract value of RM9.128 billion is the largest procurement in the history of the Ministry of Defence and also one of the largest projects undertaken by the Malaysian government

                Malaysia is scrambling to protect its assets as the descendants of the last sultan of the remote Philippine region of Sulu look to enforce a U$15 billion (RM67 billion) arbitration award in a dispute over a colonial-era land deal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 1878, two European colonists signed a deal with the sultan for the use of his territory in present-day Malaysia – an agreement that independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the monarch's descendants about $1,000 (about RM5,000) a year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia disputes that, saying the sultanate ceded sovereignty and the arbitration was illegitimate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "The arbitration is a sophisticated fiction, veiled as a legal process," Uria Menendez, a Spanish law firm representing Malaysia, told Reuters
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The heirs rejected Thomas' offer and the arbitration went on without Malaysia's participation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Stampa argued in his award statement that the courts did not have jurisdiction over arbitration, and moved the case to France to deliver the award - actions that Malaysia says were unlawful

                Johor Umno deputy chief Nur Jazlan Mohamed said this came about after PN’s representatives were rejected outright by voters in the recent Melaka and Johor state elections

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said this was obvious in the way “opportunistic party leaders” kept changing their stand on the cooperation between the Islamic party and Umno in Muafakat Nasional (MN)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said this was why Umno leaders and members must not be fooled by the “playacting” by PAS and PN and the masterminds from Umno working with them, as the party could be destroyed

                Ahmad, who was the menteri besar between 2008 and 2014, said he had knowledge and information regarding TIA because it was established under the auspices of the Terengganu government at the time he held office

                Hamzah said Penang police had opened a disciplinary investigation paper against the two traffic policemen for escorting the individual, believed to be the son of a Barisan Nasional (BN) MP

                “The project’s forensic audit report by Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) and the former navy commander’s letter must also be declassified,” they said in a joint statement, adding that BNS had been appointed to carry out a forensic audit in 2019 to identify any leaks, irregularities and abuse of power in the procurement of the ships

                Earlier, PAC chairman Wong Kah Woh said the defence ministry and BNS had ignored the navy’s views on the LCS project

                He said the initial Sigma model ships chosen by the navy were approved by the defence ministry only for this to be changed to the Gowind design on July 11, 2011, after BNS recommended it to the then defence minister three days earlier

                In its decision yesterday, the Apex court states that "Article 14A of the Penang State Constitution is not void as it is not inconsistent with Article 10(1)(c) of the Federal Constitution”

                The four assemblymen had challenged Article 14A of the Penang state constitution as they believed that the provision is open to abuse

                The four state assemblymen had filed an Originating Summons against the Penang State Assembly and State Assembly Speaker to challenge the constitutionality of Article 14A(1) of the Penang State Constitution, and to stop the four seats concerned from being declared vacant pursuant to Article 14A(1)

                Tourists look on as a Chinese military helicopter flies past Pingtan island, one of mainland China's closest point from Taiwan, ahead of massive military drills off Taiwan following Pelosi's visit
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It sparked a furious reaction from Beijing, which vowed "punishment" and announced military drills in the seas around Taiwan - some of the world's busiest waterways
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Taiwan's defence ministry said it was closely watching the drills
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Beijing's nationalist state-run tabloid Global Times said, citing military analysts, that the exercises were "unprecedented" and that missiles would fly over Taiwan for the first time
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Group of Seven industrialised nations has condemned the drills, saying in a statement there was "no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait"
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "China's announced military exercises represent a clear escalation from the existing baseline of Chinese military activities around Taiwan and from the last Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995-1996," said Amanda Hsiao, senior analyst for China at the International Crisis Group

                Responding to Lukanisman Awang Sauni (GPS-Sibuti) in the Dewan Rakyat, its minister, Annuar Musa, said Samsung was chosen as the provider after winning the contract through an open tender that was wrapped up last month

                The delay was criticised by several parties, notably former deputy education minister Teo Nie Ching, as applicants were left in the dark about the status of their applications that were made in May

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At a press conference, PAC chairman Wong Kah Woh said the initial Sigma model ships chosen by the navy were approved by the defence ministry
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The others summoned included current defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein, defence ministry secretary-general Muez Abd Aziz, former auditor-general Ambrin Buang, current navy chief Mohd Reza Sany and BNS’ CEO and chief operating officer
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong pointed out that not a single ship had been completed although RM6 billion had been spent by Putrajaya over the project given to BNS via direct negotiations
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said the PAC found that the government had failed in its duty to carry out due diligence on BNS’ financial problems
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong said BNS’ payments to the government were not entirely used for the LCS project, resulting in a cost overrun of RM1.4 billion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong also suggested that the defence ministry be required to present a progress report to the PAC on the LCS project every three months until its completion, while substantive procurement planning is periodically presented to a special select committee

                To further improve the WiFi experience at home, customers must take a few steps, including shifting the router to a part of the house where most of the time is spent

                To optimise the WiFi experience, Lolita said that Unifi now offers a variety of mesh add-ons, based on customers' lifestyle needs, the number of devices used and the size of the home

                In addition, all new Unifi customers with a capacity of 100Mbps and above will receive a WiFi 6 router to ensure they have the best WiFi signal at home

                He said the “personal liberty” stated in Article 5(1) was not an absolute right, but a right that could be regulated, such as the right to own drugs or firearms

                The article protects individuals from executive arbitrariness, but Shad said personal liberty could be deprived if this was done according to law

                As for subjecting the generation born in 2007 and later to the Tobacco and Smoking Control Bill, Shad said this was “rational and reasonable” according to the law

                As age is not a protected category, Bar Council official Andrew Khoo said it could be argued that concerns about discrimination under the bill were unwarranted

                James Chin of the University of Tasmania and the Umno Supreme Council member, who declined to be named, said these rumours should not be taken too seriously as the focus at the federal level is on the next general election (GE15)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Chin believed that Rauf was dissatisfied because he had expected to become the chief minister after the landslide win in the Melaka state elections last year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “These rumours are just part of an ongoing feud among some unhappy members of Umno,” he told FMT
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Small issues at the state level are just a sideshow,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last week, Rauf denied allegations that the 21 Umno assemblymen had any issue with Sulaiman’s leadership

                “PSD takes this matter seriously and would like to emphasise that all charges against the director-general are baseless and maliciously intended to tarnish his image as a high government official,” PSD said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 4)

                PSD explained that its director-general had reprimanded an Immigration officer at KLIA for non-compliance with practices and procedures where officials did not check the travel documents and passports of the director-general and his delegation abroad

                The KLIA Immigration Operations head was said to have been at the receiving end because there were no Immigration officers stationed at the VIP room between 8.40am and 9.40am on Wednesday

                This comes in the wake of the announcement that the retirement fund had reverted the statutory contribution rate to 11% from July, from the 9% it was reduced to last year to boost disposable income during the pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysian Trades Union Congress president Effendy Ghani said EPF should give workers until the end of the year to decide whether they want to go back to the old rate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The purpose of reducing the rate in the first place was to put more money in people’s hands,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Effendy said allowing employees to retain the 9% contribution rate till year-end would give them time to revise their financial plans
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To prevent abuse, he suggested that employees who wanted to retain their 9% contribution rate be required to apply for it
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the concerns of economists that a reduction in the contribution rate would affect the contributors later in life, Effendy pointed out that private sector employees typically received annual pay increases

                Yesterday, Chong confirmed that Gobi Krishnan had been removed from all positions in the party with immediate effect
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This was after the wing discovered that Gobi Krishnan had been declared bankrupt on Jan 7 last year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Chong has acted in contravention of the party’s constitution because as head of the associate wing, he has no power to appoint or remove anybody from any position in the party,” said Gobi Krishnan in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He claimed that the party’s constitution stipulated that only the disciplinary board could sack members through due process
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said he would lodge an official complaint against Chong to the party’s secretary-general as well as its disciplinary board for acting beyond his powers and exposing the party’s internal affairs to the public
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                The move, he added, resulted in an oversupply of chicken and caused the price to drop below the ceiling price set by the government

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In order to be competitive, the price of chicken from Malaysia should be affordable compared to the supply of frozen chicken that Singapore currently imports from Indonesia and Thailand

                “The report found that the project was not handled efficiently, reflected in the weakness of the EoT (extension of time), maintenance and ICP (industry collaboration programme),” it said

                It said weaknesses were also found in the physical security aspect of the building, as well as systems that could pose a risk of physical and system intrusion if not improved immediately

                To overcome the weaknesses raised and to ensure the mistakes are not repeated in the future, the auditor-general proposed that the transport ministry review all the contract terms to ensure that the interests of the government are protected

                That same agency, it said, failed to carry out repair works approved for 113 participants, while some RM1.08 million was returned to the finance ministry in 2016 following the housing and local government ministry’s failure to implement the programme

                About Us Advertise BALING, Aug 3 — The Musang King durian farm project in Gunung Inas here was not the cause of the debris flow tragedy on July 4 in Baling district that claimed three lives, said Kedah Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said none of the reservoirs on the project had burst as claimed by certain parties
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When asked to make comment on the statement by Minister of Environment and Water, Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man in a previous media report that said the flood was caused by a burst reservoir that on the durian farm project, he said the minister’s statement actually mentioned the “possibility” of this occurrence and it was not based on accurate facts
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Meanwhile, commenting on the flood incident that happened in several villages in Mukim Baling yesterday which was allegedly caused by the flow of water from Gunung Inas, Muhammad Sanusi said the cause of the flood incident has not yet been ascertained yet
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In another development, he said the Musang King durian farm project in the Rimba Teloi Permanent Forest Reserve (HSK), Sik will continue even though there is a possible risk of unwanted incidents in the area
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Dr Mahathir added that if there was no evidence to support the claim, he considered Apandi's statement libellous and that he had the right to take legal action
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former prime minister was responding to four questions posed by Apandi on Facebook last month, including on the Batu Puteh case, the Sulu claim, and his dismissal suit as AG
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Apandi's actions also showed negligence in claiming that Najib was innocent
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the question of why he unilaterally withdrew Malaysia’s bid to overturn the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) 2008 ruling on Batu Puteh, Dr Mahathir said it was in respect of an earlier agreement with Singapore
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "If Malaysia had not dropped the claim, Indonesia would also have grounds to claim both the Sipadan and Ligitan islands off Sabah," he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "New facts on Batu Puteh, if present, should also be presented to the international courts when making a representation that Batu Puteh indeed belonged to Malaysia," he said.

                Asbi Munip, 32, said this was because the money laundering case investigation was focused on the transfer of RM100,000 from Syed Saddiq’s personal Maybank account to his Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) account

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked by Gobind if the witness knew Syed Saddiq’s source of income before becoming a minister, Asbi answered that he knew Syed Saddiq had been a part-time tutor at the International Islamic Universiti Malaysia (IIUM)

                The 29th prosecution witness then agreed with the lawyer that he did not investigate Syed Saddiq’s source of income before he became a minister while investigating the money laundering case

                The four Penang assemblymen are Dr Afif Bahardin (Seberang Jaya, ex-PKR), Zulkifli Ibrahim (Sg Acheh, ex-PKR), Khaliq Mehtab Mohd Ishaq (Bertam, Bersatu but pro-PN), and Zolkifly Md Lazim (Telok Bahang, Bersatu but pro-PN)

                The four Penang assemblymen had previously filed an injunction against the Penang legislature from passing a motion to vacate their seats after they decided to support PN

                As for children aged between five and 11 years old who were moderately or severely immunocompromised, they will also be given a third dose vaccine at an interval of at least eight weeks after the second dose

                He was responding to a question by Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh, who wanted to know whether investigation papers had been opened against Mustapa, deputy law minister Mas Ermieyati Samsuddin and deputy health minister Dr Noor Azmi Ghazali following reports lodged with MACC on alleged misappropriation of funds or party allocations worth tens of millions of ringgit

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Zahid claimed that the Jeli MP, who was also the Kelantan Umno chief, had taken more than RM30 million that was supposed to be used to bring home Kelantan residents from the Klang Valley to vote in the state

                He also said the Masjid Tanah MP had been entrusted with funds to manage Puteri Umno in GE14, but claimed it was transferred to another account for her personal use

                Asbi Munip said this when cross-examined by Syed Saddiq’s lawyer, Gobind Singh Deo, over his investigation into the case

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gobind said Syed Saddiq had raised “various defences” to justify a transfer of RM100,000 into his Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) account as well as a RM120,000 deposit into his bank account when the authorities recorded his statements in 2020

                In reply, Asbi said his investigation focused on the transfer of RM100,000 from Syed Saddiq’s Maybank account to his ASB account between June 16 and June 19, 2018

                In January, activist groups in Sabah questioned the identity of Sabah MIC chief Peer Mohamad Kadir, who allegedly shares the same name as an individual from India who entered the state in 1984, and was a witness in the Royal Commission of Inquiry (RCI) on illegal immigration in Sabah in 2013

                Its chief, Nuridah Salleh, said Oktoberfest was not appropriate here because it would be viewed as an open invitation to encourage drinking, which would pose a danger for all Malaysians

                The former finance minister refuted a claim by Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob that DAP dominated the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government, pointing out that only six of the 29 ministers in the PH Cabinet were from the party

                “Umno is playing on extremist sentiments to win the general election by blaming everything on DAP.” Lim said another of Umno’s “false narratives” was the claim that DAP refused to implement subsidies or direct financial assistance

                He also said former transport minister Loke Siew Fook, who is now the DAP secretary-general, was the one who proposed the reimbursement of RM555 million to the armed forces pension fund (LTAT), which it spent to take over the concession of the Automatic Enforcement System (AES) for driving offences as per a 2014 government directive

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim said DAP also initiated an 18% toll reduction for the North-South Expressway (PLUS) as the first step towards the complete abolition of PLUS tolls by the end of 2022

                Beyond Borders and the Alliance of Chin Refugees cited the case of a Myanmar refugee who took his own life after throwing three of his children from the Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR2) highway yesterday morning

                The NGOs urged Putrajaya to put an end to immigration raids and to give refugees the right to work in Malaysia, to ease the pressure the community was facing

                Even having a UNHCR card doesn’t guarantee they won’t get arrested by the police or immigration,” they said in a joint statement

                Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles was quoted by the Philippine News Agency as saying that the proprietary claim by the heirs was "in the nature of a private claim"

                Marcos Jr's recent statement about the country's territory, Cruz-Angeles explained, also still needs to be clarified

                “The President’s articulation of his statement about not giving up a square inch of territory will have to be reduced into writing and into specifics, after which, we will announce these to you if they are in any way related to the Sabah claim," she said

                However, without knowing the decision of the Madrid Court to cancel Stampa's appointment as an arbitrator, a French arbitration court went ahead with the Sulu descendants' case against Malaysia last September

                On Feb 28 this year, the Paris Arbitration Court awarded the Sulu heirs US$14.92bil (RM66.4bil) from Malaysia

                It followed a U.N.-brokered grain and fertiliser export agreement between Moscow and Kyiv last month - a rare diplomatic breakthrough in a drawn-out war of attrition

                in partnership with Turkey, we had a first ship with the delivery of grain, but it’s still nothing

                He said Ukraine, one of the world's top grain producers before the war, had to export a minimum 10 million tonnes of grain to urgently help bring down its budget deficit which was running at $5 billion a month
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the grain shipment but also said it was "only a first step"

                Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the grain deal might offer a way forward out of conflict

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "A first success is the grain deal, perhaps that can be slowly expanded to a ceasefire." Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had also told Schroeder that, in theory, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was ready to be used to help increase gas supplies to Europe

                Future-proof health financing options will be included in the Health White Paper that is to be presented by year end, says Khairy Jamaluddin

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 – Malaysia’s public health care system, which charges RM1 and RM5 for outpatient and specialist care respectively in Ministry of Health (MOH) facilities, is unsustainable, Khairy Jamaluddin said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The government is aware that the existing public health financing model is not sustainable and will put additional pressure on the federal expenditure
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As such, the government is currently studying various future-proof health financing options to strengthen the country’s health care system as a whole so that health services are more equitable, have high standards, easily accessible at a reasonable cost, and are sustainable in the long run
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairy said the government will use a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to ensure that the people’s health interests are protected in the implementation of any health financing system in the future
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Khairy later clarified that social health insurance is one of various health financing proposals that will be included in his White Paper on health care reform

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                India fulfils two-thirds of its vegetable oil demand through imports of around 14 million tonnes annually, including around 8.5 million tonnes of palm oil
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Even if Telangana manages to grow oil palm on only 1 million acres and produces 2 million tonnes of palm oil, it would be a huge achievement, said Chava Venkateswara Rao of Godrej Agrovet Ltd GODE.NS, the country's biggest palm oil producer
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Until last year, the country was adding around 35,000 acres under oil palm every year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Now, with the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project, we have ample water for oil palm," said farmer Bollampalli Venkateshwar Rao, who planted oil palms on 12 acres
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ravi Mathur, who heads the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research (IIOPR), a government-backed body spearheading the oil palm push, said the lift irrigation project has made oil palm planting feasible in areas previously unsuitable for the crop because of water scarcity

                With the rate being restored to 11% after having been cut to 9% in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Universiti Putra Malaysia’s (UPM) Rusmawati Said cautioned that if employees are unable to save now, it would get complicated when they were older
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last year, the employee’s share of the statutory contribution rate to EPF was reduced to 9% to boost disposable income during the pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In July, it was set back to 11%
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rusmawati said an individual earning RM2,000 a month would contribute RM220 based on the current rate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “When employees retire, they will have savings that would allow them to get by.” Barjoyai also said employees should not look at the amount deducted for such contributions as a loss as the sum would eventually “return” with interest
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “EPF isn’t a tax but a long-term saving scheme,” he said, adding that this was the best time to revert to the 11% rate to ensure that retirement plans would not be disrupted

                Sheikh Moqhtar Kadir said the PJD Link was merely a rebranding of the Kinrara Damansara Expressway (Kidex) that was cancelled in 2015 and removed from the Selangor State Structural Plan 2035 by the state government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Based on this, why did the ministry not exclude PJD Link from the Malaysia Highway Authority’s Highway Network Development Plan (HNDP) 2030?” said Moqhtar, the chairman of the Coalition Against PJD Link Highway, in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “How was PJD Link given its approval in principle when Kidex was to be removed from the Selangor State Structural Plan 2035?” He noted that menteri besar Amirudin Shari had “confirmed (Kidex’s) rebranding” at a PKR political bureau meeting last September
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Moqhtar said the coalition was seeking Fadillah’s consideration to review the validity of the PJD Link’s concession agreement since the minister had acknowledged the cancellation of Kidex in Parliament in 2016
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                His statement comes a day after Fadillah met with representatives of “Say No To PJD Link”, a group of Selangor residents against the planned highway, to assure them that the project would have to get the state government’s nod, and approval by the works ministry, before going ahead
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The project was approved in principle by the Cabinet on Nov 12, 2017, and by the Selangor government on Sept 3, 2020

                It’s not practical when you consider that construction costs have gone up and developers are having a hard time meeting the demand for affordable housing.” Juwairiya was commenting on Selangor MCA chief Ng Chok Sin’s remarks that the price of affordable homes in Selangor should be reduced by half if BN wrests control of the state in GE15

                For instance, Ng said, affordable homes built under a state government programme could be reduced in price from RM250,000 to RM125,000

                On March 24, Judicial Commissioner Datuk Mohd Arief Emran Arifin ordered the Pekan Member of Parliament to disclose to SRC’s lawyers in writing his assets in or outside Malaysia, up to the value of RM42 million within 30 days after the order has been served on Najib
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mohd Arief Emran directed that Najib must not remove, dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of any of the assets in and outside Malaysia up to the value of RM42 million, pending the final determination of the suit
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib also disclosed that he had a total of RM1.24 million in an Affin Bank account and a deposit of RM2.52 million with Amanah Saham Nasional Berhad
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Through the affidavit filed on April 25, Najib confirmed that he did not have assets amounting to RM42 million
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On July 28, 2020, the High Court sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined RM210 million after he was found guilty of misappropriating RM42 million belonging to SRC

                Deputy defence minister Ikmal Hisham Abdul Aziz said the ministry had completed all tender evaluation processes to acquire the unmanned aircraft for use by the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) to strengthen its defence capability

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the ministry’s procurement board had certified the selected tenderers and submitted them to the finance ministry on July 7

                The maintenance ecosystem would be implemented after the expiry of the warranty period from the original equipment manufacturer, based on the maintenance concept determined by RMAF

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ahmad Tarmizi had asked about the status of the tender, procurement, maintenance for the MALE UAS aircraft during the question-and-answer session

                In reply to a supplementary question from Awang Husaini Sahari (PH-Putatan) regarding the objective of acquiring the system, Ikmal said the aircraft would carry out intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions for the armed forces

                Labuan domestic trade and consumer affairs department director Junaidah Arbain said the sugar was imported by three wholesalers

                “We hope they are able to resolve the issues as soon as possible so that the sugar can be released,” she said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Junaidah said the longer the wholesalers let the sugar lie stranded at the port, the more charges they would have to bear

                Penang mufti, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Salim Wan Mohd Noor said it proved that coming from different ethnic and religious backgrounds was not an obstacle to establishing a good and cordial relationship between individuals

                Magistrate Nadia Othman set the date to continue the hearing after deputy public prosecutor Nur Aishah Ahmad Zakiuddin informed the court that both parties had agreed for new dates to be fixed for the hearing
