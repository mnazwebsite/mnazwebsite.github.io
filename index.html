                The state’s Ruler, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, has also agreed that there is no need to dissolve the assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amirudin was speaking to reporters after an audience with the Sultan at Istana Bukit Kayangan here yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On his meeting with the Sultan, Amirudin said it was merely the weekly meeting where various state matters were discussed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We discussed many issues such as the state’s development as well as the management of its economy

            <p>
                “Tuanku advised us to expedite and complete the necessary tasks before the dissolution (of the state legislative assembly),’’ said Amirudin, adding that other issues discussed with Sultan Sharafuddin included the upcoming state budget, the First Selangor Plan and the expected floods
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also conveyed to the Ruler that Pakatan Harapan did not want to dissolve the state assembly now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the state’s decision not to dissolve the assembly was conveyed to the Sultan some time ago and he (Amirudin) had also given a suggestion on when it would likely be done
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said the state budget, scheduled to be tabled on Oct 28, might have to be postponed due to the impending general election
            </p>
            
            <p>

                According to Amirudin, the budget may have to be postponed as state government officers would be given various duties to be carried out during the parliamentary polls and this may affect the efficiency of the budget preparation and presentation

                Oct 11 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) is planning a major reduction in headcount, likely numbering in the thousands, in the face of a slowdown in the personal computer market, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the situation

                Muda information chief Luqman Long said political parties planning to dismiss the group would do so at their peril, notwithstanding predictions that the majority in the age group would ultimately not end up casting their ballots

                He believed the young, first-time voters would buck predictions of their political apathy, and be an important deciding factor in GE15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I am optimistic that they know — in order to change the course of this country in a way that actually appreciates, respects, and values the youth — they will go out to vote for the party that fights for them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If political parties refuse to accept the fact that the youth are the focal point, they would face deep trouble

                There would be fatal consequences if they dare to disregard the voice of the youth,” he told Malay Mail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To this end, Luqman said Muda’s main focus would be championing the youth in matters such as the cost-of-living crisis, the lack of affordable housing, the quality of education, and dignified wage for all to lift Malaysia up the global value chain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Muda was not only aiming to empower the youth by representing them in such matters, but also to ensure that the typically underserved segment would have a pathway to become decision- and policy-makers in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Undi18 co-founder Tharma Pillai acknowledged that while the youth vote was demonstrably low in previous state elections, this would be different in GE15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also argued that the turnout had been low in general during the Sarawak, Melaka, and Johor elections, and expressed confidence that youths would play a bigger role in GE15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tharma also suggested that young voters might be less engaged with state politics due to migration, but would be more interested in national politics by virtue of residing in urban locations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also warned against dismissing the value of the youth on the off chance that they were less likely to vote, saying that even a small segment of this age group could alter the result of any election

            <p>
                During its second-quarter earnings call, Intel acknowledged that it could make changes in its business to improve profits

                Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, declined to comment on the layoffs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Intel’s last big wave of layoffs occurred in 2016, when it trimmed about 12,000 jobs, or 11% of its total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like many companies in the technology industry, Intel also froze hiring earlier this year, when market conditions soured and fears of a recession grew
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gelsinger took the helm at Intel last year and has been working to restore the company’s reputation as a Silicon Valley legend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Intel lost its long-held technological edge, and its own executives acknowledge that the company’s culture of innovation withered in recent years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s a particularly awkward moment for Intel to be making cutbacks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company lobbied heavily for a $52 billion chip-stimulus bill this year, vowing to expand its manufacturing in the US
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time, the company is under intense pressure from investors to shore up its profits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company’s shares have fallen more than 50% in 2022, with a 20% plunge occurring in the last month alone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                David Zinsner, Intel’s chief financial officer, said after the company’s latest quarterly report that “there are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar.” The chipmaker expected to see restructuring charges in the third quarter, he said, signaling that cuts were looming

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Intel’s last big wave of layoffs occurred in 2016, when it trimmed about 12,000 jobs, or 11% of its total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like many companies in the technology industry, Intel also froze hiring earlier this year, when market conditions soured and fears of a recession grew
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gelsinger took the helm at Intel last year and has been working to restore the company’s reputation as a Silicon Valley legend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Intel lost its long-held technological edge, and its own executives acknowledge that the company’s culture of innovation withered in recent years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s a particularly awkward moment for Intel to be making cutbacks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company lobbied heavily for a $52 billion chip-stimulus bill this year, vowing to expand its manufacturing in the US
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time, the company is under intense pressure from investors to shore up its profits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company’s shares have fallen more than 50% in 2022, with a 20% plunge occurring in the last month alone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                David Zinsner, Intel’s chief financial officer, said after the company’s latest quarterly report that “there are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar.” The chipmaker expected to see restructuring charges in the third quarter, he said, signaling that cuts were looming

                Craig Burley says Kylian Mbappe's ego has taken over after rumours of his desire to leave PSG
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The news comes just five months after Mbappe, 23, signed a new contract with PSG, with sources saying he feels at odds with the club's direction on and off the pitch

            <p>
                "I am very surprised because I spend all my days with Kylian Mbappe, and he never once asked me or the president to leave in January," Campos told RMC Sport

                If you bought a house before 2022, then you should count yourself among the fortunate

                Chances are good you're overpaying for home insurance

            <p>
                In the decade that preceded the pandemic, the value of owner-occupied housing climbed back up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since the beginning of the pandemic, the cost of owning a home has hit new heights
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Zillow’s August housing report, the monthly mortgage payment on a typical home bought in 2022 has almost doubled since 2019, going from $897 to $1,643
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They’re paying that much less every month for housing than the person who bought during the pandemic, or since interest rates began rising in mid-2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The data shows that American homeowners, pre-pandemic, had a median net worth of $255,000, while renters had a net worth of just $6,300

                To be equity rich means that the loan on your house is half, or less than half, of the estimated market value of your house
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s a year-over-year jump of 20%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It stands to reason that those who have homes, and who bought them at the right time, will continue to see their net worth increase

                If you bought a house before 2022, then you should count yourself among the fortunate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chances are good you're overpaying for home insurance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the decade that preceded the pandemic, the value of owner-occupied housing climbed back up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since the beginning of the pandemic, the cost of owning a home has hit new heights
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Zillow’s August housing report, the monthly mortgage payment on a typical home bought in 2022 has almost doubled since 2019, going from $897 to $1,643
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They’re paying that much less every month for housing than the person who bought during the pandemic, or since interest rates began rising in mid-2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The data shows that American homeowners, pre-pandemic, had a median net worth of $255,000, while renters had a net worth of just $6,300
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Home Equity and Underwater report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To be equity rich means that the loan on your house is half, or less than half, of the estimated market value of your house
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s a year-over-year jump of 20%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It stands to reason that those who have homes, and who bought them at the right time, will continue to see their net worth increase
            </p>

                Liu, who is a party central executive committee (CEC) member, said in a message posted on his Facebook Timeline, that although he was unhappy and disillusioned with some of his party leaders, he would stay on for the sake of his constituents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I’m afraid the party secretary-general has to wait a little longer for my official resignation letter," said Liu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the post, Liu also accused some of the party leaders of having been smitten by power, position and perks during Pakatan Harapan’s 22-month tenure as the Federal Government as well as losing touch with the party’s original ideals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Liu said the DAP was his “life” and that it was still a good party with strong grassroots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unfortunately, he added, although DAP called itself democratic, some party leaders did not really understand this principle championed by the party
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liu urged the DAP to admit mistakes were made during its 22 months as Federal Government and together with Pakatan Harapan, apologise to the voters and seek a second chance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added the recent amendments to the party constitution allowing the secretary-general to remove any member who disagreed with the CEC was a classic example of "tyranny of the majority." The proposed amendments would grant the CEC the clout to kick out any member deemed not following party directives
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The party's elected representatives or senators who refused to listen to the CEC's instructions could also be booted out of the DAP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was understood the party had already sent the proposed amendments to the Registrar of Societies (ROS) for approval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liu criticised the amendments and said they were a serious infringement on freedom of expression

                Shafee instead assured the High Court that any postponements sought will only be if there are legal reasons to do so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Past 4pm today, Shafee had requested a short 10 minute break while he was cross-examining 39th prosecution witness Cheah Tek Kuang, explaining that he realised he had not taken his medicine and asked to continue the 1MDB trial tomorrow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When High Court judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah asked if he must take the medicine then, Shafee said he was supposed to take it at 11am but had forgotten, and continued to say he prefers to have the trial resume tomorrow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee said he would take at most another 45 minutes to complete his cross-examination of Cheah and promised that the 1MDB trial could start at 9.30am tomorrow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hearing this, the judge finally agreed, and checked to ensure that Shafee would have no problem attending the 1MDB trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Sequerah noted that the 1MDB trial had started in 2018, Shafee continued to argue by saying he had a client today whose case goes back to 1997 and that he had told the judge in that case that he too could no longer tolerate delay to that case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sequerah then pointed out that he had also told Shafee’s colleague Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed that he is competent enough to conduct cross-examination of prosecution witnesses in the 1MDB trial in Shafee’s absence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Shafee insisted that he should be the one to personally handle cross-examination of some witnesses as Najib would otherwise be unhappy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While other lawyers from Najib’s legal team do carry out cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, Shafee would sometimes carry out parts of the cross-examination of witnesses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This had led to some disruptions in the 1MDB trial due to the need to wait for Shafee to be available, such as last Thursday when the trial could not go on as Shafee was on a four-day medical leave and Cheah was scheduled to be cross-examined by him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The morning session of the 1MDB trial today also had to end earlier after the 40th prosecution witness and former AmInvestment Bank managing director Kok Tuck Cheong had read out his witness statement, as Shafee was the one who was supposed to cross-examine him but was engaged in another court case before another High Court judge.

                IT WAS business interrupted for traders at the Tanjong Karang morning market who had no choice but to repack their stalls as flood waters started to rise in Pekan Tanjung Karang, Selangor, after Sungai Tengi burst its banks at around 7am on Tuesday (Oct 11)

                Having grown up in Tanjung Karang, Asrul Afeeq, 34, one of the affected motorists, could vouch for the fact that flooding was a rare occurrence here

                IT WAS business interrupted for traders at the Tanjong Karang morning market who had no choice but to repack their stalls as flood waters started to rise in Pekan Tanjung Karang, Selangor, after Sungai Tengi burst its banks at around 7am on Tuesday (Oct 11)

                Having grown up in Tanjung Karang, Asrul Afeeq, 34, one of the affected motorists, could vouch for the fact that flooding was a rare occurrence here

                Among those is Cathie Wood, the CEO and CIO of investment firm ARK Invest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Monday, Wood penned an open letter to Fed officials accusing them of making a “policy error” with their interest rate hikes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But on Monday, Wood said her concern was merely deflation and the potential for a global “bust” as a result of the Fed’s policies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Out of concern that the Fed is making a policy error that will cause deflation, we offered some data for our ‘data-driven’ Fed to consider as it prepares for its next decision on Nov

            <p>
                Wood and her team of analysts at ARK Invest believe inflation is already on its way down, and in their letter to the Fed, they put together some evidence that they believe illustrates why
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wood argued that all of this data shows that inflation has peaked and is beginning to fall back down toward the Fed’s 2% target rate, which means more interest rate hikes rates aren’t necessary and could lead to a global “deflationary bust.” While economists and consumers have been captivated by inflation’s rise over the past two years, in the decades before that, and particularly in the era after the Great Financial Crisis, deflation was the Fed’s main fear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wood believes these policies aren’t necessary, and that the deflationary impact of technological innovation will ultimately slay inflation with or without the Fed

            <p>

                But this year, with the Fed tightening financial conditions, Wood’s flagship fund is down over 62%

            <p>
                But despite CEOs like Cathie Wood and Starwood Property’s Barry Sternlicht calling for the Fed to pause its rate hikes or even pivot to rate cuts, Fed officials have made it clear in recent weeks that they aren’t changing their plans anytime soon

                Sabra Healthcare, the first dividend stock we’ll look at, focuses its operations on properties in the healthcare field

            <p>
                This metric was reported at 38 cents per share in Q2, allowing the company to declare a common share dividend payment of 30 cents

            <p>
                At the current rate, the dividend annualizes to $1.20, and gives a robust yield of 9.5%

                Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~37% potential total return profile

                The company’s last dividend declaration was made this past September, for 23 cents per common share, and was paid out on September 30
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current dividend annualizes to 92 cents; while that sounds modest, it represents an impressive yield of 16.1% – not many companies of any sort can offer a dividend yield in that range

                This came after the court was informed by Najib's lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed that lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah was not around to conduct the cross-examination of witness Kok Tuck Cheong, who is an ex-managing director of AmInvestment Bank Bhd, as the senior lawyer had another matter before Judicial Commissioner Azhar Abdul Hamid here on Tuesday

            <p>
                Kok had finished reading his witness statement and was still on the witness stand awaiting the proceedings when lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram voiced his dissatisfaction over Muhammad Shafee's absence and requested for the cross-examination to be conducted this week

            <p>
                Justice Sequerah said if Muhammad Shafee was not available for cross-examination and there was no one else to step in for him, the court would assume that cross-examination was done and continue with re-examination

            <p>
                This took place after Najib's lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed informed the court that Najib's lead defence lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah will be handling the cross-examination of 40th prosecution witness Kok Tuck Cheong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Aizuddin then requested for the defence to be allowed to postpone its cross-examination of Kok as Shafee was handling another case in another High Court here this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prosecution witnesses would provide testimony at the examination-in-chief stage which is when they will testify and answer questions from the prosecution to provide clarification, before answering questions by Najib's lawyers during the cross-examination stage and before the prosecution then asks final questions at the re-examination stage for the witness to clarify their answers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is only after the re-examination stage that a witness is considered to have completed their testimony in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From now on, if Tan Sri Shafee is unable to conduct cross-examination, Encik Wan, you have to step up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I have accommodated, we can't keep reserving cross-examination and have the trial conducted by instalment over and over again." "I have accommodated as much as I can, I cannot go beyond this," the judge said, saying that he would otherwise consider the defence team to have completed cross-examination if they do not carry out any cross-examination while waiting for Shafee to be available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Aizuddin said he did ask questions during cross-examination to certain prosecution witnesses, and that he was not prepared to conduct cross-examination at this point
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "What I'm saying, hereafter, there will be no more reserving of cross-examination, that's what I'm saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What I'm saying is beyond today, I'm unable to accede to request from defence to reserve any more cross-examination," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The judge pointed out that Najib's legal team is a big team and Wan Aizuddin would be able to carry out any cross-examination without having to wait for Shafee to do it personally

                This took place after Najib's lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed informed the court that Najib's lead defence lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah will be handling the cross-examination of 40th prosecution witness Kok Tuck Cheong

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prosecution witnesses would provide testimony at the examination-in-chief stage which is when they will testify and answer questions from the prosecution to provide clarification, before answering questions by Najib's lawyers during the cross-examination stage and before the prosecution then asks final questions at the re-examination stage for the witness to clarify their answers

            <p>
                I have accommodated, we can't keep reserving cross-examination and have the trial conducted by instalment over and over again." "I have accommodated as much as I can, I cannot go beyond this," the judge said, saying that he would otherwise consider the defence team to have completed cross-examination if they do not carry out any cross-examination while waiting for Shafee to be available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Aizuddin said he did ask questions during cross-examination to certain prosecution witnesses, and that he was not prepared to conduct cross-examination at this point

            <p>

                The judge pointed out that Najib's legal team is a big team and Wan Aizuddin would be able to carry out any cross-examination without having to wait for Shafee to do it personally

                Before the pandemic, travellers from Hong Kong and China made up 37 per cent of all foreign visitors to Japan, and 44 per cent of tourism income

                The Battersea Power Station project covers 17 hectares (42 acres) with 3.5 million sq ft of mixed commercial space and 4,239 new housing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The commercial assets within the power station building are now directly owned by Permodalan Nasional Bhd and EPF
            </p>
            
            <p>
                British-based Battersea Power Station Development Company (BPSDC) is managing the development
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The £9 billion (£1=RM5.14) Battersea Power Station will be launched on Oct 12 and will be officially opened to the public on Oct 14
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The itinerary includes a Battersea Power Station commercial and retail tour, KOA residential tour and a Lift 109 experience -- a unique glass elevator inside the north-west chimney which offers an epic panoramic view of London from a height of 109m from ground level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Festival of Power Headlining the festival is Arcadia’s Lords of Lightning, a dueling spectacle involving multimillion volt bolts being fired between the two ‘Lords’ hosted on the six-acre Power Station Park at 7pm, Oct 14, Sime Darby Property said in a statement recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other highlights include the official countdown to the Power Station opening its doors from 10 am
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will be live music throughout the Festival of Power including special performances by the Battersea Power Station Community Choir after the official countdown, ‘Emerge Showcase’ from World Heart-Beat Music Academy and the Setia Drummers, a troupe of Malaysian drummers
            </p>

                A long day of Dota with eight series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With two streams running at the same time, eight series were played over the day—and there were some surprises in store
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was an exceedingly even day of competition—all four upper bracket series took three games to finish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                T1, Team Secret, Team Liquid, and Virtus Pro came out with the spoils in the TI11 LCQ upper bracket, though VP slogged through more than two hours of Dota to come out on top
            </p>
            
            <p>
                October 10 Upper bracket quarterfinals Stream A Stream B Lower bracket round 1 Stream A Stream B Virtus Pro was in trouble in their series against Vici Gaming
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Losing game one to a quick blitz from Vici’s overwhelming Sniper, the Chinese team once again went for the same hero pick in game two
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even with the counter secured, the game was anything but straightforward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was one of the best games of the tournament thus far, and VP rode the victory into game three—another long one at 51 minutes—to finally close out the series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wildcard, with all eyes on them in the last match of the day, started the series with an unorthodox draft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both heroes proved effective against Troll Warlord, and Naga’s constant Though game two was more of an orthodox draft, Wildcard’s execution remained stellar

            <p>
                Mohamed Azmin, on the other hand, would like to become a maths teacher, while Mohamed Azrul has set his mind on becoming a lecturer

                Arsenal went into the game full of confidence thanks to ten wins in eleven matches across all competitions this season, whilst Jurgen Klopp's side found themselves part of Liverpool’s worst start to the league for eight years, now ten after yesterday’s defeat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not that long ago, Liverpool were the team to beat after being crowned champions of England and Europe, but now Arsenal are making a push of their own to reach that very level

            <p>
                However, although those match-ups were both a success for Arsenal, it was Gabriel Martinelli who ultimately stole the show

            <p>
                Despite having a head start, Diaz was swiftly overtaken by Martinelli, who ended up winning a foul for his side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Considering Diaz is easily one of the quickest players in the league, it was some sprint from Martinelli
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saka found the Norwegian just outside the 18-yard box, who then spotted Martinelli making a run in behind the Liverpool backline

                He had been courted by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for over 12 months before signing to join United.  The England international put pen to paper on a £73million - swapping Borussia Dortmund and the Bundesliga for United and the Premier League

                During the 2018-2019 season he scored 12 goals and provided 18 assists.  As a result, Sancho was handed his England debut against the United States in November 2018.  Ferdinand says Sancho has shown glimpses of his talent during games like the Liverpool one Playing on the left side, he enjoyed an even more productive 2019-20 season with 17 Bundesliga goals and assists - which is when Manchester United first came calling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, United dusted themselves off and moved for Sancho again in the 2021 summer transfer window - securing his services for £73m.  Sancho has since failed to live up to expectations

                It’s becoming a worrying theme of the Reds’ season, Salah’s woes in front of goal
            </p>

            <p>
                Salah is only a ghost of himself right now.” There’s no question that Salah is capable of turning around this slump and reminding English football why he’s been such a devastating force since joining Liverpool for £36 million in 2017 [The Guardian]
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah has struggled at times before, but the Reds overall were still playing excellent and therefore there was less pressure on the main man
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it’s entirely different now and if Liverpool don’t improve as a unit, or Salah continues to struggle, then Jurgen Klopp’s side are in big, big trouble

                It’s becoming a worrying theme of the Reds’ season, Salah’s woes in front of goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Liverpool forward has only managed three goals from open play across the Premier League and Champions League since August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah is only a ghost of himself right now.” There’s no question that Salah is capable of turning around this slump and reminding English football why he’s been such a devastating force since joining Liverpool for £36 million in 2017 [The Guardian]
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah has struggled at times before, but the Reds overall were still playing excellent and therefore there was less pressure on the main man
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it’s entirely different now and if Liverpool don’t improve as a unit, or Salah continues to struggle, then Jurgen Klopp’s side are in big, big trouble

                Here is the incredible tale of South Korea's passage to the World Cup semi-finals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                South Korea enjoyed a memorable run to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup finals The 2002 World Cup began without much incident for one of the tournament's co-hosts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Most suspected there would be no drama and his side would coast to a quarter-final berth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'If Spain didn't win it's because they didn't let us win.'   South Korea, backed by a vociferous home crowd, went on to win the tie on penalties to become the first Asian team to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spain's Fernando Morientes had a goal controversially ruled out in the quarter-final As the European heavyweights of Italy and Spain fumed back at home, South Korea were into the last four
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They were as good off the pitch as their team were on it.  South Korea were beaten by Germany in the semi-finals as Michael Ballack celebrates Victory over Spain sent them into a semi-final showdown with Germany and that was where their run would end.  But a South Korean side written off as no-hopers had captured the imagination of their country - and the world - and ensured they would go down in World Cup folklore

                The coalition could even see its control of Penang — currently a stronghold — erode if it were to have the state elections separately from the 15th general election set to be held next month, they cautioned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They said the Opposition coalition would have an equal fight against the Barisan Nasional (BN) and Perikatan Nasional (PN) election machinery in GE15, but not so if the state elections were only held next year

                “It was proven previously that when state elections were held, PH lost,” said Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) Associate Professor Mohd Azizuddin Mohd Sani

            <p>
                Mohd Azizuddin explained that PH would need high voter turnouts to defend the states successfully, but this would typically be low for standalone state elections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Oh conceded that if PH were to also hold the state polls during GE15, its resources would also have to be spread thin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Universiti Malaysia socioeconomic analyst Awang Azman Awang Pawi said Penang would remain as a PH stronghold regardless of when the state poll were to be called, noting that the coalition currently holds all but seven seats in the assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also believed that while an undistracted BN would be able to bring all its might to bear on the state, it would only be likely to claw back some of the ground lost since 2008

                Belarus, Moscow's closest ally, said it had begun an exercise to assess its "combat readiness" after ordering troops on Monday to deploy with Russian forces near its border with Ukraine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Belarus allowed Russia to use its territory to invade Ukraine but has not yet sent its own troops across the border

            <p>
                Zelenskiy said Russia had started a new stage of escalation, so new sanctions were needed, and he called for an international monitoring mission on Ukraine's border with Belarus

            <p>
                Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has repeatedly accused Ukraine of preparing to attack his country, though he has offered no evidence and Kyiv denies any such plan

                A driver walks near his burned car after Russian military strike, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in central Kyiv, Ukraine October 10, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                President Joe Biden and other Group of Seven leaders will convene virtually later on Tuesday to discuss what more they can do to support Ukraine and to listen to Zelenskiy who has called air defence systems his "number 1 priority," something Biden has already promised to provide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BELARUS FEARS G7 leaders may also warn Belarus, a close Russian ally, against closer involvement in the war after Minsk said on Monday it was deploying its soldiers with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what it said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its backers in the West
            </p>
            
            <p>
                French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna told France Inter radio on Tuesday that G7 heads of state would probably warn Belarus, which is already used by Russia as a logistics base and as a platform from which to fire missiles, not to get more involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's deputy foreign minister warned Russia would respond to the West's growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We warn and hope that they realise the danger of uncontrolled escalation in Washington and other Western capitals," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by RIA news agency on Tuesday

                A driver walks near his burned car after Russian military strike, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in central Kyiv, Ukraine October 10, 2022

            <p>
                President Joe Biden and other Group of Seven leaders will convene virtually later on Tuesday to discuss what more they can do to support Ukraine and to listen to Zelenskiy who has called air defence systems his "number 1 priority," something Biden has already promised to provide

                BELARUS FEARS G7 leaders may also warn Belarus, a close Russian ally, against closer involvement in the war after Minsk said on Monday it was deploying its soldiers with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what it said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its backers in the West
            </p>
            
            <p>
                French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna told France Inter radio on Tuesday that G7 heads of state would probably warn Belarus, which is already used by Russia as a logistics base and as a platform from which to fire missiles, not to get more involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's deputy foreign minister warned Russia would respond to the West's growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We warn and hope that they realise the danger of uncontrolled escalation in Washington and other Western capitals," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by RIA news agency on Tuesday

                Premier League • England Erik ten Hag has been lambasted for his handling of Antony, with a pundit claiming one of the Man Utd manager’s key requests will turn the Brazilian against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Antony was Manchester United’s marquee signing over the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Antony tracked back well in the 2-1 victory over Everton on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Antony’s defensive workrate was hailed by Ten Hag post-match
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In the first game, he was not always that good defending-wise but today he was really good, really disciplined,” Ten Hag said of Antony (via the Manchester Evening News)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s more, the former West Ham and Celtic striker claimed it won’t be long before Antony gets “fed up” with Ten Hag’s demand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He will get fed up with it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Antony’s three goals in three league matches so far suggest he’s even more potent than in Amsterdam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s more, Ten Hag’s tactics closely mirror those he deployed at Ajax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Defensive duties are therefore no stranger to Antony
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It stands to reason he knew he’d be asked to contribute in his own half upon signing for Ten Hag at Manchester United

                Ukraine on Monday said it needed to strengthen its air defence following Russia's biggest aerial assaults on cities since the beginning of the war, retaliation for what Moscow called a Ukrainian attack on a strategic bridge in Crimea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russian President Vladimir Putin said he ordered "massive" long-range strikes after accusing Ukraine of an attack on the  bridge linking Russia to annexed Crimea on Saturday
            </p>

                Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke to Biden on Monday and wrote on Telegram that air defence was the "number 1 priority in our defence cooperation"

                A driver walks near his burned car after Russian military strike, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in central Kyiv, Ukraine October 10, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ukrainians woke up to the wailing of new air raid sirens on Tuesday, with parts of the country left without power
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Officials said 19 were killed on Monday in cruise missile strikes across the country, the biggest air raids since the start of the war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kyiv and its allies condemned Russia's strikes, which mainly hit civil infrastructure such as power stations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                President Joe Biden and other Group of Seven leaders will convene virtually later on Tuesday to discuss what more they can do to support Ukraine and to listen to Zelenskiy, who has called air defence systems his "number 1 priority"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine's sixth largest city, has remained under Ukrainian control throughout the war, despite Russia occupying most of the surrounding province, among four partially occupied regions that Moscow claims to have annexed this month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an overnight video address from the scene of one of the attacks in Kyiv, Zelenskiy promised that Ukraine would keep fighting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                BELARUS FEARS G7 leaders are also expected to issue a warning Belarus, Moscow's closest ally, against deeper involvement in the war, after Minsk said on Monday it was deploying soldiers with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what it called a threat from Kyiv and its Western allies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That is a violation of the rules of war and international law." Moscow has accused the West of escalating the conflict by supporting Ukraine

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said more help to Ukraine raised the risk of a wider war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia blamed Ukraine and called the deadly explosion "terrorism"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He threatened more strikes if Ukraine hits Russian territory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That's not to say that the explosion on the Crimea bridge might have accelerated some of their planning."  Ukraine, which views the bridge as a military target sustaining Russia's war effort, celebrated the blast without claiming responsibility
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Saturday, Russia made its third senior military appointment in the space of a week with air force General Sergei Surovikin taking over as commander of forces in Ukraine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He previously commanded Russia's brutal air campaign in Syria
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia says it is waging a "special military operation" in Ukraine to rid it of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ukraine and the West say it is an unprovoked war of aggression
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ukraine's defence ministry said in a Monday evening update Russia had staged at least 84 missile and air strikes, and Ukraine's air defences had destroyed 43 cruise missiles and 13 drones
            </p>

                A question mark hangs over Cristiano Ronaldo's future at Manchester United despite scoring GOAL MACHINE Who needs one reason when 700 will do? Ronaldo’s strike rate alone is enough to justify his value to any team, even four months short of his 38th birthday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He might not press as hard as Ten Hag would like, but if there is anyone you would back in front of goal, it is Ronaldo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goals are the only currency that matter in football and Ronaldo has scored them in abundance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag (right) might not be in a position to let Ronaldo go when the window next reopens GOLD STANDARD As United strive to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford, there can be no better benchmark than Ronaldo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When Ronaldo joined United the first time, he told fitness coach Mick Clegg that he was going to be the best player in the world and has dedicated his life to achieving his goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo's professionalism is likely to rub off on younger Man United players such as Antony FADING FORCE Look beyond the incredible career stats and it is clear that Ronaldo is not the player he once was
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Notably, the debate about Ronaldo being a regular starter for United is also taking place at international level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo needs a club, United need a striker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources close to Ronaldo say he is unconvinced by the manager and was bemused that he was left on the bench in United’s thrashing in the Manchester derby out of respect for his career

                A question mark hangs over Cristiano Ronaldo's future at Manchester United despite scoring GOAL MACHINE Who needs one reason when 700 will do? Ronaldo’s strike rate alone is enough to justify his value to any team, even four months short of his 38th birthday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He might not press as hard as Ten Hag would like, but if there is anyone you would back in front of goal, it is Ronaldo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goals are the only currency that matter in football and Ronaldo has scored them in abundance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag (right) might not be in a position to let Ronaldo go when the window next reopens GOLD STANDARD As United strive to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford, there can be no better benchmark than Ronaldo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When Ronaldo joined United the first time, he told fitness coach Mick Clegg that he was going to be the best player in the world and has dedicated his life to achieving his goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo's professionalism is likely to rub off on younger Man United players such as Antony FADING FORCE Look beyond the incredible career stats and it is clear that Ronaldo is not the player he once was
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Notably, the debate about Ronaldo being a regular starter for United is also taking place at international level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo needs a club, United need a striker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources close to Ronaldo say he is unconvinced by the manager and was bemused that he was left on the bench in United’s thrashing in the Manchester derby out of respect for his career
            </p>

                If auto-portability gets adopted nationwide, these companies say that it can help Americans preserve $1.5 trillion in additional retirement savings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Let's break down what this collaboration means, how auto portability works and what you can do to avoid losing retirement money when you change jobs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, Alight Solutions and Retirement Clearinghouse are creating an auto-portability network to help workers avoid losing money in taxes and penalties when they cash out small retirement account balances after switching jobs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The press release announcing the auto-portability network in October says that this automated process focuses on account balances under $5,000; and if auto-portability gets adopted nationwide, it can help Americans preserve $1.5 trillion in additional retirement savings over 40 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Workers with less than $5,000-the focus of the auto portability service-cash out at the time of their job change at much higher rates than all job-changing workers." For reference, an auto-portability bill proposed by U.S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The press release says that the auto-portability network currently represents almost 44 million workers in more than 48,000 employer-sponsored retirement plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Employees leaving a workplace can generally keep their 401(k) where it is, roll it over into another account with a new employer or transfer the money to an individual retirement account (IRA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And as noted earlier by the Retirement Clearinghouse, a 25-year-old with $5,000 in retirement savings can see it grow to $70,000 over time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And transferring your 401(k) balance to another account with a new employer will also allow you to put all of your retirement money in one place

            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can boost your retirement savings instead by keeping your money in an old 401(k) or rolling it over to a new 401(k) or an IRA account

                Darwin Núñez amassed more offsides against Arsenal than every other player on the pitch combined, and his running in behind captures Jürgen Klopp's tactical shift

                He was Liverpool's biggest threat in the game, with his tendency to drift offside offering an insight into the tactical shift that Jürgen Klopp is currently experiencing

                A new policy in PayPal’s fine print triggered a storm of outrage over apparent plans to impose, starting on Nov

            <p>
                PayPal quickly apologized over the weekend for what it called “confusion”, claiming it was all just an error, but not before a a deluge of criticism from a number of high-profile individuals—including its own former president, David Marcus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Marcus took to Twitter to say the new Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) was an “insanity” that forced him to come forward and criticize his previous employer, where he worked for three years from 2011 after former PayPal owner eBay acquired a company he founded and joined it with the payments service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “PayPal’s new AUP goes against everything I believe in,” he posted on Saturday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy,” a spokesperson later told media outlets over the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “PayPal freezing funds for thought crimes is despicable,” he wrote over the weekend in response to the controversy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Marcus, the former PayPal president, is himself a fan of Bitcoin and later ran Meta's project to develop a crypto wallet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PayPal's supposed new policy only exacerbated a common fear in the crypto community that the state will eventually seek to sideline virtual assets through the introduction of central bank digital currencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The intense blowback will not likely be helpful for PayPal shares, which have thus far been a poor investment in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While payment services giant Visa declined by only 15% year-to-date, PayPal has more than halved in value

                Each stock also holds a Strong Buy consensus rating; let’s see what makes them so attractive to Wall Street’s analysts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the last reported quarter, 2Q22, WPC showed a 7.7% year-over-year gain in total revenues, from $319.7 million in the year-ago quarter to $344.4 million in the current report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These factors continue to favorably position the company to outperform, in our view.” This reinforces the analyst's view that WPC is a stock to "buy," and worth a $93 target price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At current levels, this target suggests ~30% upside for the year ahead

                Each stock also holds a Strong Buy consensus rating; let’s see what makes them so attractive to Wall Street’s analysts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the last reported quarter, 2Q22, WPC showed a 7.7% year-over-year gain in total revenues, from $319.7 million in the year-ago quarter to $344.4 million in the current report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These factors continue to favorably position the company to outperform, in our view.” This reinforces the analyst's view that WPC is a stock to "buy," and worth a $93 target price

            <p>
                At current levels, this target suggests ~30% upside for the year ahead

                The former prime minister said Perikatan felt that it would be unsuitable to hold a general election at the moment due to the probability of floods and also other issues faced by the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That is our view
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We respect the Constitution and the decision," said Muhyiddin at a press conference here on Monday (Oct 10)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked whether the timing would work in favour or against Perikatan, Muhyiddin said the people were ready for it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I would say that the rakyat are facing a lot of problems but I think they want to exercise their right as voters to get a better government, a government that will take care of them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin said the voter turnout was expected to be low but he hoped that would not happen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On candidates, Muhyiddin said the Perikatan component parties had already started drawing their list of names to be fielded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Perikatan would follow the principle of retaining incumbency of seats won by the respective parties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin also said the cooperation between the Perikatan component parties was close and the coalition's election machinery would be organised under the single name of Perikatan.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                "That is our view
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We respect the Constitution and the decision," said Muhyiddin at a press conference here on Monday (Oct 10)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked whether the timing would work in favour or against Perikatan, Muhyiddin said the people were ready for it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I would say that the rakyat are facing a lot of problems but I think they want to exercise their right as voters to get a better government, a government that will take care of them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin said the voter turnout was expected to be low but he hoped that would not happen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On candidates, Muhyiddin said the Perikatan component parties had already started drawing their list of names to be fielded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Perikatan would follow the principle of retaining incumbency of seats won by the respective parties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhyiddin also said the cooperation between the Perikatan component parties was close and the coalition's election machinery would be organised under the single name of Perikatan.

                The Prime Minister said on Monday (Oct 10) that the King had given his formal consent to dissolve Parliament, paving the way for the 15th General Election (GE15) to be held within 60 days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I had an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on Sunday (Oct 9) afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He consented to the dissolution of Parliament on Monday in accordance with Article 40(2)(b) and Article 55(2) of the Federal Constitution," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri made the announcement in a special address broadcast live on local television and social media on Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It should be conducted at the same time to ensure that the rakyat are not burdened, aside from ensuring the smoothness of the democractic process and to save costs," said Ismail Sabri
            </p>

                The Prime Minister said on Monday (Oct 10) that the King had given his formal consent to dissolve Parliament, paving the way for the 15th General Election (GE15) to be held within 60 days

                Neighbours are seen at the entrance of a compound in lockdown in the Changning district, after new Covid-19 cases were reported in Shanghai, on Oct 8, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shanghai posted 34 new local infections, the most in almost three months, with two infections found outside of its quarantine system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a sign of the tensions in the country, even a city that has zero infections has gone into lockdown

            <p>
                In a commentary published Monday, the official People’s Daily newspaper said Covid Zero measures are scientific and virus variants remain a major threat to the elderly

                Some residential compounds under lockdown have received food supplies from the local government, and rumors about school suspension have been spreading

            <p>
                Selina Liu, a 35-year-old auditor who lives in Shanghai, traveled to Yunnan during last week’s holiday and got stuck in a quarantine hotel during a local outbreak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lockdown of her hotel was lifted on Sunday and she was able to fly back to Shanghai after some of her earlier flight bookings were canceled

            <p>
                Remarks from an official in the western region of Xinjiang, where some cities have been under lockdown for two months, also stirred controversy on social media

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Until being booted out of the game by clumsy Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey, Luis Diaz had been, like in so many recent outings, the Reds’ most dangerous forward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That he was sat on the touchline as Liverpool chased in vain for a third equaliser spoke volumes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gomez opportunity knocks Any reminder of the Roy Hodgson era is enough to send a shiver down the spine of any Liverpool supporter who endured that dark period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That, though, isn’t sufficient to explain the brittle nature of Liverpool’s performances away from Anfield this season, the defence again too easily prised apart
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joe Gomez would not have wanted to make his 150th Liverpool appearance at the expense of the crocked Trent Alexander-Arnold, but there could now be an opening for him at right-back if his team-mate is sidelined for a period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But at least Klopp now has options

                Bobby dazzles - briefly So continues Roberto Firmino’s Liverpool farewell tour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On for the stricken Diaz, Firmino just took 11 minutes to impressively slot home Liverpool’s second equaliser, his 10th in the league against Arsenal – more than any other player in the Reds' history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And with Nunez producing another encouraging all-round performance to go with his strike, there cannot be too many quibbles with Liverpool’s goal threat – even if their collective defending leaves much to be desired
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp needs to find the right balance – and quickly

                Joe Gomez would not have wanted to make his 150th Liverpool appearance at the expense of the crocked Trent Alexander-Arnold, but there could now be an opening for him at right-back if his team-mate is sidelined for a period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But at least Klopp now has options

            </p>
            
            <p>
                On for the stricken Diaz, Firmino just took 11 minutes to impressively slot home Liverpool’s second equaliser, his 10th in the league against Arsenal – more than any other player in the Reds' history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And with Nunez producing another encouraging all-round performance to go with his strike, there cannot be too many quibbles with Liverpool’s goal threat – even if their collective defending leaves much to be desired
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp needs to find the right balance – and quickly

                Premier League • England Paul Merson has labelled Arsenal ‘outstanding’ and ‘phenomenal’ for how they handled Liverpool in their 3-2 Premier League victory at home

            <p>
                The Dutchman explained how midfield star Casemiro is important to his United team The 30-year-old started slow but grew into the game on his first league start for the club ten Hag did, however, confirm Anthony Martial has picked up a new injury after the forward was subbed in the first half

                Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said any loss of confidence on the prime minister, as stipulated under the Federal Constitution, was only when MPs retracted their support for him

                When Erik ten Hag’s starting XI was revealed for Manchester United’s clash away at Everton on Sunday evening, Casemiro’s first Premier League start as a Red was confirmed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Casemiro is still adjusting to English football, but the signs from his first Premier League start are promising… THE SIGNS ARE THERE The majority of Casemiro’s play against the Toffees highlighted what an asset he will become for the Reds this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Battling for possession, and also having eye for a pass, the Brazilian demonstrated just why Ten Hag brought him to Old Trafford in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, as is expected of a player still adapting to life in the Premier League, there were a couple of rogue passes and lapses in concentration, but Casemiro dealt with the pressure well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                None of Casemiro’s balls were more impressive than his assist, though, when the Brazilian regained possession well in the centre of the park before splitting the Everton defence with one through ball to the feet of Cristiano Ronaldo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo's 700th goal in club football proved our match-winner, but don't overlook Casemiro's quality assist..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s safe to say Casemiro hasn’t disappointed
            </p>

                When Erik ten Hag’s starting XI was revealed for Manchester United’s clash away at Everton on Sunday evening, Casemiro’s first Premier League start as a Red was confirmed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Casemiro is still adjusting to English football, but the signs from his first Premier League start are promising… THE SIGNS ARE THERE The majority of Casemiro’s play against the Toffees highlighted what an asset he will become for the Reds this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Battling for possession, and also having eye for a pass, the Brazilian demonstrated just why Ten Hag brought him to Old Trafford in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, as is expected of a player still adapting to life in the Premier League, there were a couple of rogue passes and lapses in concentration, but Casemiro dealt with the pressure well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                None of Casemiro’s balls were more impressive than his assist, though, when the Brazilian regained possession well in the centre of the park before splitting the Everton defence with one through ball to the feet of Cristiano Ronaldo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo's 700th goal in club football proved our match-winner, but don't overlook Casemiro's quality assist..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s safe to say Casemiro hasn’t disappointed

                Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah also urged the bodies involved to ensure that assistance reached flood victims effectively and quickly in a systematic manner

                “The preparations must not only be in mitigating the effects of floods, but also in devising a system to ensure that assistance reaches the flood victims in a planned manner quickly and effectively,” the King said

                This is why the Prophet insisted on a tight-knit relationship between the leader and his community based on love and respect

            </p>
            
            <p>
                His Majesty also stated that the non-discriminatory policies for all religions in the Medina Charter, which was used to govern by the Prophet, ensured a united nation under his leadership, six decades before the Magna Carta itself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (Issued in June 1215, the Magna Carta was the first document to put into writing the principle that the King of England and his government were not above the law.) At the same event, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Idris Ahmad said it was vital for a Muslim-majority country to practise the concept of welfare and non-discriminatory policies for everyone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As a country with Muslims as its majority, the multiracial and multi- religious community has to understand that Islam celebrates diversity and plurality of a community, a Malaysian asset
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The success of Prophet Muhammad as an excellent statesman must be exemplified, especially his leadership in the administration of a diverse community,” he said.

                His Majesty also stated that the non-discriminatory policies for all religions in the Medina Charter, which was used to govern by the Prophet, ensured a united nation under his leadership, six decades before the Magna Carta itself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (Issued in June 1215, the Magna Carta was the first document to put into writing the principle that the King of England and his government were not above the law.) At the same event, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Idris Ahmad said it was vital for a Muslim-majority country to practise the concept of welfare and non-discriminatory policies for everyone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As a country with Muslims as its majority, the multiracial and multi- religious community has to understand that Islam celebrates diversity and plurality of a community, a Malaysian asset

            <p>
                “The success of Prophet Muhammad as an excellent statesman must be exemplified, especially his leadership in the administration of a diverse community,” he said.

                The big question is whether Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob can announce the dissolution of Parliament with the King not being in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Talk is that Ismail Sabri has received the King’s formal consent to dissolve Parliament and that the Prime Minister has relayed this to Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If the King has consented to the dissolution of Parliament with a date fixed and if this has already been gazetted, the dissolution can take place even if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is not in the country,’’ he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Shad Saleem said three elements – the King’s formal consent, a fixed date and gazetting of the dissolution – must be fulfilled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said these formalities must be strictly adhered to as the dissolution of Parliament was a crucial event which will see “222 MPs losing their jobs” and the Election Commission getting into action to set a date for nomination and polling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer and activist Nizam Bashir Abdul Kariem Bashir echoed the view, adding that once consent to dissolve Parliament had been made, the Federal Constitution provides no restrictions as to where the Yang di-Pertuan Agong must be
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Political observers urged Ismail Sabri to announce Parliament’s dissolution as soon as possible if it was indeed true that the King had already given the green light
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We don’t know how foreign direct investments will react if the dissolution of Parliament is left hanging and the general election is delayed,’’ said political analyst Prof Dr Sivamurugan Pandian
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said indications of Parliament being close to dissolution were clearly evident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Umno top five have met and the Prime Minister has also had an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong,’’ he said, adding the early tabling of Budget 2023 was also an indicator

                Man United are yet to decide on De Gea's future at Old Trafford, with the club considering triggering a one-year extension on his current deal

            <p>
                During his 11-year stay at Old Trafford, the Spanish goalkeeper has played his way to the top of the pile in the United dressing room, and is the only remaining player from the club's last title-winning squad to regularly play

                Rob Dawson talks about Cristiano Ronaldo after the Manchester United striker scores his 700th career club goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo, 37, scored his 700th club career goal to give United the lead after Antony had equalised from Alex Iwobi's early opener
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I am really happy because he has been working hard to get this goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Brazilian shifted onto his favoured left foot and fired past Jordan Pickford to score his third goal in as many matches for United since signing from Ajax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And it was the substitute Ronaldo who gave United the lead, scoring his 700th club goal a minute before the end of the first half
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - Ronaldo proves himself in much-needed United win The Portuguese striker burst down the left flank and showed his goalscoring pedigree with a clinical low, left-footed strike past Pickford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "United had good possession and moved the ball well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There's a lot I can reflect on in the game but when you look at it in the cold light of day it was two of our mistakes that led to goals." United's victory moved them up to fifth in the Premier League table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Premier League title race is almost a quarter of the way through
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's still early, but how will things pan for the Big Six in the months ahead? Sunday's 3-2 loss at Arsenal left Liverpool 10th in the Premier League table, and the numbers from their season so far make for grim reading

                Rob Dawson talks about Cristiano Ronaldo after the Manchester United striker scores his 700th career club goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo, 37, scored his 700th club career goal to give United the lead after Antony had equalised from Alex Iwobi's early opener
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I am really happy because he has been working hard to get this goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Brazilian shifted onto his favoured left foot and fired past Jordan Pickford to score his third goal in as many matches for United since signing from Ajax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And it was the substitute Ronaldo who gave United the lead, scoring his 700th club goal a minute before the end of the first half
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - Ronaldo proves himself in much-needed United win The Portuguese striker burst down the left flank and showed his goalscoring pedigree with a clinical low, left-footed strike past Pickford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "United had good possession and moved the ball well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There's a lot I can reflect on in the game but when you look at it in the cold light of day it was two of our mistakes that led to goals." United's victory moved them up to fifth in the Premier League table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Premier League title race is almost a quarter of the way through
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's still early, but how will things pan for the Big Six in the months ahead? Sunday's 3-2 loss at Arsenal left Liverpool 10th in the Premier League table, and the numbers from their season so far make for grim reading

            <p>
                It could prove to be a massive moment in Ronaldo's United season, with the 37-year-old previously under pressure

            <p>

            <p>
                Anthony Martial  Martial was handed his first start of the season after impressing from the bench against Manchester City and Omonia Nicosia, replacing Jadon Sancho in the starting XI

            <p>
                Although Martial did provide the assist for Antony's leveller, Ronaldo's strike and his overall performance could dent Martial's chances of playing more when he is back fit

                Until being booted out of the game by clumsy Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey, Luis Diaz had been, like in so many recent outings, the Reds’ most dangerous forward

                Gomez opportunity knocks Any reminder of the Roy Hodgson era is enough to send a shiver down the spine of any Liverpool supporter who endured that dark period

            <p>
                That, though, isn’t sufficient to explain the brittle nature of Liverpool’s performances away from Anfield this season, the defence again too easily prised apart
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joe Gomez would not have wanted to make his 150th Liverpool appearance at the expense of the crocked Trent Alexander-Arnold, but there could now be an opening for him at right-back if his team-mate is sidelined for a period

                On for the stricken Diaz, Firmino just took 11 minutes to impressively slot home Liverpool’s second equaliser, his 10th in the league against Arsenal – more than any other player in the Reds' history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And with Nunez producing another encouraging all-round performance to go with his strike, there cannot be too many quibbles with Liverpool’s goal threat – even if their collective defending leaves much to be desired

                The continued pursuit of options other than cancellation, however, means that as well as being one of the last events in the region to run before the pandemic, it will be one of the first to return.  China’s WorldTour ranked Tour of Guangxi, which was due to finish off the top-tier season, was cancelled again this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether it’s the time slot, an enthusiasm to return to the region after a period of absence, or the intensity of the relegation battle, it's a bumper crop of top-tier teams on the start list for the Tour de Langkawi this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                UAE Team Emirates, Cofidis, Lotto Soudal, EF Education-EasyPost and Movistar will be lining up at the race for the first time, while Astana-Qazaqstan are returning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, it will be an all-out battle for stage, category and overall glory

                Perhaps he will be looking for some alternate cooling methods in the heat of Malaysia as he takes on the Tour de Langkawi for the first time

            <p>
                It may be called the Tour of Langkawi but while the island off northwestern Malaysia may be the eponymous endpoint, this is one of those occasions where it is as much about the journey as the destination.  After flying into Kuala Lumpur, the riders will spend the first three stages within reach of the nation’s capital before the stages stretch out towards the north and then transfer over to Langkawi, known as the Jewel of Kedah, for the last two stages.  The initial stages aren’t without their challenges, with the 157.3 km opening day from Kuala Pilah including 5 categorised climbs – all category 2 and 3 – before the race charges down from Look Out Point for an expected sprint in front of the Petronas Twin Tower in the centre of Kuala Lumpur.  Two category 3 climbs await on the flatter stage 2 but it is the longest stage of the race at 178.9km.  Then there is stage 3, which is set to be a make or break point for overall challengers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 131.9km stage from Putrajaya to the Genting Highlands has a history of proving pivotal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Riders will face two category 2 climbs, one of them the familiar Look Out Point from near the end of stage 1, as they skirt past Kuala Lumpur and toward the final battle of the day.  Riders will face the dual challenge of the HC climbs of Gohtong Jaya and Genting Highlands in quick succession with the Gohtong Jaya KOM just 20km before the finish line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The race is likely to also deliver more opportunity for a bunch sprint over the next two stages – stage 5 from Kuala Kangsar to Kulim and stage 6 from Georgetown to Alor Setar – as the race heads north and ever closer to its Langkawi finale.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first stage on Langkawi from Kuah to Gunung Raya may be the shortest of the race at 90.8km but it is not without its challenges and is the most likely stage, after the Genting Highlands, to sway the GC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The final stage on Tuesday October 18 loops its way around the island on the Kuah Langkawi loop to deliver 115.9km and a finale for the sprinters

                The continued pursuit of options other than cancellation, however, means that as well as being one of the last events in the region to run before the pandemic, it will be one of the first to return.  China’s WorldTour ranked Tour of Guangxi, which was due to finish off the top-tier season, was cancelled again this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether it’s the time slot, an enthusiasm to return to the region after a period of absence, or the intensity of the relegation battle, it's a bumper crop of top-tier teams on the start list for the Tour de Langkawi this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                UAE Team Emirates, Cofidis, Lotto Soudal, EF Education-EasyPost and Movistar will be lining up at the race for the first time, while Astana-Qazaqstan are returning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, it will be an all-out battle for stage, category and overall glory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps he will be looking for some alternate cooling methods in the heat of Malaysia as he takes on the Tour de Langkawi for the first time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It may be called the Tour of Langkawi but while the island off northwestern Malaysia may be the eponymous endpoint, this is one of those occasions where it is as much about the journey as the destination.  After flying into Kuala Lumpur, the riders will spend the first three stages within reach of the nation’s capital before the stages stretch out towards the north and then transfer over to Langkawi, known as the Jewel of Kedah, for the last two stages.  The initial stages aren’t without their challenges, with the 157.3 km opening day from Kuala Pilah including 5 categorised climbs – all category 2 and 3 – before the race charges down from Look Out Point for an expected sprint in front of the Petronas Twin Tower in the centre of Kuala Lumpur.  Two category 3 climbs await on the flatter stage 2 but it is the longest stage of the race at 178.9km.  Then there is stage 3, which is set to be a make or break point for overall challengers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 131.9km stage from Putrajaya to the Genting Highlands has a history of proving pivotal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Riders will face two category 2 climbs, one of them the familiar Look Out Point from near the end of stage 1, as they skirt past Kuala Lumpur and toward the final battle of the day.  Riders will face the dual challenge of the HC climbs of Gohtong Jaya and Genting Highlands in quick succession with the Gohtong Jaya KOM just 20km before the finish line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The race is likely to also deliver more opportunity for a bunch sprint over the next two stages – stage 5 from Kuala Kangsar to Kulim and stage 6 from Georgetown to Alor Setar – as the race heads north and ever closer to its Langkawi finale.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first stage on Langkawi from Kuah to Gunung Raya may be the shortest of the race at 90.8km but it is not without its challenges and is the most likely stage, after the Genting Highlands, to sway the GC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The final stage on Tuesday October 18 loops its way around the island on the Kuah Langkawi loop to deliver 115.9km and a finale for the sprinters
            </p>

                Pipeline leak has an impact on volumes to customers Petronas has declared force majeure on gas supplies to MLNG Dua — one of four liquefaction projects at the Petronas LNG Complex in Bintulu, Sarawak – following a pipeline leak which has left the Malaysian energy giant scrambling to find volumes for some of its customers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Force majeure was declared on MLNG Dua (MLNG 2) on 21 September after subsidence issues on a section of the Sabah-Sarawak Gas Pipeline (SSGP) denominated as KP201
            </p>

                The SSGP pipeline delivers feedstock gas to the liquefaction facility
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company gave no suggestion as to when the pipeline might be repaired and when force majeure might be lifted from the three-train MLNG Dua complex, which has nameplate liquefaction capacity of 9.6 million tonnes per annum of LNG
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Petronas added that it wants to clarify that the force majeure is affecting the supply of gas to MLNG Dua’s production facility only
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other LNG production facilities — MLNG, MLNG Tiga and Train 9 — within its LNG Complex continue to operate as planned

            <p>
                Petronas Canada LNG has a 72% stake in the North Montney Joint Venture, where its partners include China’s Sinopec Corp (15% stake), Indian Oil Corp (10%) and Petroleum Brunei (3%)

                Apart from assets in Canada, a number of Dutch companies controlled by Petronas — Petronas West Papua IV Indonesia BV, Petronas Gebang Indonesia BV, Petronas Aru Indonesia BV, Petronas Andaman III Indonesia BV, Natuna 1 BV, PC Sakakemang BV — control the national oil company’s Indonesian operations

                Petronas Andaman III has a 49% stake in a joint venture with Repsol, PC Sakakemang has 45% equity interest in the Sakakemang production sharing contract (PSC) and Petronas Aru Indonesia owns 40% of the Aru PSC, among others

                In an effort to counter rising prices at the pump, President Biden plans to plunder the country’s “oil piggy bank.” In November, the Department of Energy will deliver 10 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The SPR — the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil — was established back in 1975 in case of a severe oil supply crisis or economic disruption
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Biden’s decision comes after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) said it would slash oil production by 2 million barrels a day — putting extra pressure on the global energy supply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, even before OPEC+ declared it would be cutting back on oil production, gas prices began inching back up again in late September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group says the production cuts are being made due to “the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” As of Oct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The press release noted that 10 million barrels of oil would be drained from the SPR and the Secretary of Energy would be exploring other options to increase domestic production
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since March, the Energy Department has released 160 million barrels of crude oil, or over a quarter of the stockpile — draining the SPR to its lowest levels in four decades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                2021 that it strongly opposed tapping into oil stockpiles to counter gas prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group’s concern was that depleting the emergency reserve could put the U.S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                at risk if the global or domestic oil supply reaches dangerously low levels before the supply can be brought back up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The IPAA recommends ramping up domestic natural gas and oil production instead, although oil producers are already dealing with supply-chain issues, limited capital and investor pressure to boost returns

                In an effort to counter rising prices at the pump, President Biden plans to plunder the country’s “oil piggy bank.” In November, the Department of Energy will deliver 10 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The SPR — the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil — was established back in 1975 in case of a severe oil supply crisis or economic disruption
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Biden’s decision comes after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) said it would slash oil production by 2 million barrels a day — putting extra pressure on the global energy supply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, even before OPEC+ declared it would be cutting back on oil production, gas prices began inching back up again in late September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group says the production cuts are being made due to “the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” As of Oct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The press release noted that 10 million barrels of oil would be drained from the SPR and the Secretary of Energy would be exploring other options to increase domestic production
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since March, the Energy Department has released 160 million barrels of crude oil, or over a quarter of the stockpile — draining the SPR to its lowest levels in four decades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                2021 that it strongly opposed tapping into oil stockpiles to counter gas prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group’s concern was that depleting the emergency reserve could put the U.S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                at risk if the global or domestic oil supply reaches dangerously low levels before the supply can be brought back up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The IPAA recommends ramping up domestic natural gas and oil production instead, although oil producers are already dealing with supply-chain issues, limited capital and investor pressure to boost returns

                If you buy one between now and the end of October, you’ll earn a composite interest rate of 9.62% for the first six months you hold the bonds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new semi-annual rate, which is calculated from a formula based on the CPI index from March through September, is expected to slip to around 6% in early November when the new rate is set
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “For investors who haven't taken advantage of their I bond purchase allotment so far this year, snapping up the bonds with the current 9.6% interest rate is a smart idea,” Christine Benz, Morningstar's director of personal finance, told Yahoo Money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It combines a fixed rate set when the bond is issued which never changes over its 30-year life, and a variable rate, which is reset twice a year in May and November and is based on the six-month change of the non-seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for all items, including food and energy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The I bond inflation rate that will be announced in November will be based on the difference between the CPI-U figures of March and September,” Ken Tumin, founder and editor of DepositAccounts.com, a bank account comparison site, told Yahoo Money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We won’t know the September figure until October 13, but based on the figures from March through August, the I bond inflation rate will likely be close to 6%.” While the composite rate could fall to zero, it’s guaranteed not to fall below that — so you’ll definitely get your initial investment back when you redeem the bond

                In general, you can only purchase up to $10,000 in I bonds each calendar year

                Tawatchai Supolwong holds his 3-year-old daugther Paveenut Supolwong, nicknamed Ammy, who is the only child survivor of the day care centre mass shooting, during a family meeting at their home in Uthai Sawan, Nong Bua Lam Phu province, Thailand, October 9, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Paveenut Supolwong, nicknamed "Ammy", is normally a light sleeper, but at naptime on Thursday when the killer burst into the nursery and began murdering 22 children, Ammy was fast asleep with the blanket covering her face, her parents said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was the only child in the nursery to have escaped unscathed after former police officer Panya Khamrap killed more than 30 people, mostly children in the nursery, in a rampage through the town of Uthai Sawan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I'm in shock," said Ammy's mother, Panompai Sithong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ammy's parents said she seems to have no memory of the tragedy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ammy sat patiently in her mother's lap, looking around shyly through big eyes and playing with two candles she held
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Later in the day they sat for a Buddhist ceremony at the nursery, where mourners have left white floral wreaths and more presents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At Ammy's home, her mother said she believed spirits had protected her little girl
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have different beliefs, but to me, I think it protected my kid." Another relative told local media Ammy's survival was a "miracle"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the family had to break the news to her that her beloved best friend, two-year-old Techin, and her teacher were dead

                Inter Miami owner David Beckham is reportedly willing to offer Manchester United striker Cristiano Ronaldo a £30million salary to lure him to MLS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was reported that Ronaldo received an offer from a club in Saudi Arabia, but he was not interested as he wanted to remain in Europe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having stayed at Old Trafford to compete in the Europa League, the 37-year-old has started the season very poorly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo is out of contract next year, however, Manchester United have the option to extend his contract by a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And according to the Daily Star, Ronaldo’s United ‘nightmare’ could be coming to an end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The American club are currently managed by Ronaldo’s former United teammate Phil Neville
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is said that the decision on Ronaldo’s future will come down to Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United face Everton on Sunday evening with the 37-year-old likely to start on the bench once again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Man Utd are nannying a GOAT The article Ronaldo offered way out of Man Utd with club ‘willing to offer’ lucrative £30m annual salary appeared first on Football365.com
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 37-year-old… Erik ten Hag is hoping Cristiano Ronaldo's 700th club goal of his career can spark a return to form after the Portuguese scored the winner in Manchester United's 2-1 win at Everton on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag expects to see plenty more from Cristiano Ronaldo after his 700th career club goal got him off the mark in the Premier League this season

                Inter Miami owner David Beckham is reportedly willing to offer Manchester United striker Cristiano Ronaldo a £30million salary to lure him to MLS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was reported that Ronaldo received an offer from a club in Saudi Arabia, but he was not interested as he wanted to remain in Europe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having stayed at Old Trafford to compete in the Europa League, the 37-year-old has started the season very poorly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo is out of contract next year, however, Manchester United have the option to extend his contract by a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And according to the Daily Star, Ronaldo’s United ‘nightmare’ could be coming to an end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The American club are currently managed by Ronaldo’s former United teammate Phil Neville
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is said that the decision on Ronaldo’s future will come down to Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United face Everton on Sunday evening with the 37-year-old likely to start on the bench once again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Man Utd are nannying a GOAT The article Ronaldo offered way out of Man Utd with club ‘willing to offer’ lucrative £30m annual salary appeared first on Football365.com
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 37-year-old… Erik ten Hag is hoping Cristiano Ronaldo's 700th club goal of his career can spark a return to form after the Portuguese scored the winner in Manchester United's 2-1 win at Everton on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag expects to see plenty more from Cristiano Ronaldo after his 700th career club goal got him off the mark in the Premier League this season
            </p>

                Curtis Jones is the latest player to return from the medical room, having taken part in team training this week after missing out on most of the new campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He hasn’t featured since playing the last few seconds of Liverpool’s Community Shield bout with Manchester City in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A clearly-defined 4-3-3 was the team's set system when he last took to the field, with Jones primarily regarded as a left-sided number eight in the squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tactical tweak poses a potential problem for Jones, who is an offensive box-to-box player rather than one who would be inclined to hold the fort, meaning he's now less suited to playing in central midfield for the Reds

                It is also possible for him to be deployed as a second striker of sorts, albeit one who would almost play as a number ten whenever his teammates have possession under control

                They report that while his base salary is £375,000-per-week, bonuses that are 'almost guaranteed' mean that he is much closer to the territory of earnings that Kylian Mbappé secured in his new deal with Paris Saint-Germain

                “Some people would take a snapshot of their business cards and send them over as digital images without the need to give out the physical cards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Most consumers also find it more convenient to save contacts directly into their mobile phones than to store a business card,” he added

            <p>
                With such low quantities to roll out, many printers are merely providing business card printing as a service to attract customers to their business, said Tan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The small profit margin from printing business cards isn’t worth focusing on,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Tan noted that business cards are still being used by businessmen who appreciate them as a gesture of sincerity and to showcase their trade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With newer technologies to apply coating and embossing to business cards, they are seen as status symbols
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They believe that business cards give a good first impression on their business, and are important and worth investing in.” Tan said the most popular feature on business cards currently is the Spot UV option, where a special coating is applied at specific areas to add depth and contrast through varying levels of sheen and texture
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For 300 pieces of business cards to print, Tan is offering RM45 for the ordinary type and RM69 for those with Spot UV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I have ordinary printers for other jobs and they can print business cards in small quantities, which would not be efficient
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There used to be many shops providing business card printing in town and we were among the largest, but now we’re the smallest,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Checks with other shops that provided such printing service found it was no longer the focus of their business as they have moved on to other things such as banners.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                With such low quantities to roll out, many printers are merely providing business card printing as a service to attract customers to their business, said Tan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The small profit margin from printing business cards isn’t worth focusing on,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Tan noted that business cards are still being used by businessmen who appreciate them as a gesture of sincerity and to showcase their trade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With newer technologies to apply coating and embossing to business cards, they are seen as status symbols
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They believe that business cards give a good first impression on their business, and are important and worth investing in.” Tan said the most popular feature on business cards currently is the Spot UV option, where a special coating is applied at specific areas to add depth and contrast through varying levels of sheen and texture
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For 300 pieces of business cards to print, Tan is offering RM45 for the ordinary type and RM69 for those with Spot UV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I have ordinary printers for other jobs and they can print business cards in small quantities, which would not be efficient
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There used to be many shops providing business card printing in town and we were among the largest, but now we’re the smallest,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Checks with other shops that provided such printing service found it was no longer the focus of their business as they have moved on to other things such as banners.

                It was a back-and-forth affair in the early to mid-game until the crucial Enhanced Lord spawned at the 17-minute mark
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As both teams were trying to find an opening in the Lord pit, Slate Esports’ Akihiro “JPL” Furusawa’s Jawhead caught Brayden “BRAYYY” Teo’s Balmond with Ejector and threw him into the Lord pit to get the kill

            <p>
                RSG forced a seventh and final game thanks to a flawless performance from regular season MVP Bellamy “Lolsie” Yeov on Chou and Babycakes on Melissa
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the final game of the series, Slate tried to counter RSG’s all-melee lineup of Julian, Chou, and Benedetta with Cyclops, the hero’s debut in the league
            </p>
            
            <p>
                RSG SG tried to use their early game advantage and secured a 6-1 kill score at the 10-minute mark
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was such a one-sided matchup that Slate weren’t able to destroy any towers, trailing by as much as 11,000 gold in the late game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                RSG eventually secured the crown after a clean wipeout in the top lane at the 15-minute mark

                It was a back-and-forth affair in the early to mid-game until the crucial Enhanced Lord spawned at the 17-minute mark
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As both teams were trying to find an opening in the Lord pit, Slate Esports’ Akihiro “JPL” Furusawa’s Jawhead caught Brayden “BRAYYY” Teo’s Balmond with Ejector and threw him into the Lord pit to get the kill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With RSG SG’s jungler gone, Slate Esports secured three more kills and the Enhanced Lord
            </p>
            
            <p>
                RSG forced a seventh and final game thanks to a flawless performance from regular season MVP Bellamy “Lolsie” Yeov on Chou and Babycakes on Melissa
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the final game of the series, Slate tried to counter RSG’s all-melee lineup of Julian, Chou, and Benedetta with Cyclops, the hero’s debut in the league
            </p>
            
            <p>
                RSG SG tried to use their early game advantage and secured a 6-1 kill score at the 10-minute mark
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was such a one-sided matchup that Slate weren’t able to destroy any towers, trailing by as much as 11,000 gold in the late game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                RSG eventually secured the crown after a clean wipeout in the top lane at the 15-minute mark

                It wasn’t a great day for North and South American teams—just four wins shared between the four squads from the region on day one, with the two teams in Group A only providing one
            </p>

                NAVI had a clean day one, with both series wins coming against nouns and Tempest

                And while they hold the top spot heading into the second day, Team Secret, Polaris Esports, and Vici Gaming continue to gun for the top spot

                While most will favor Secret and NAVI from this group, Vici and Polaris have each taken a game off the two teams respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s arguable that all three of the top teams in Group B at the end of day one are amongst the top favorites to come out of the LCQ—even Evil Geniuses’ Artour “Arteezy” Babaev agreed

            <p>
                But Eastern European team Virtus Pro will be kicking themselves for missing a chance to go clear on top of Group B

                The team lost an 18,000 gold lead in game one against Wildcard Gaming

                Red Bull driver Max Verstappen of the Netherlands celebrates his win during the Japanese Formula One Grand Prix at the Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka, central Japan, Sunday, Oct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Verstappen secured his second consecutive Formula One drivers' championship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Red Bull's Verstappen crossed the line first and he was then awarded the title when second-place finisher Charles Leclerc was given a five-second penalty, dropping him to third
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The result gave Verstappen an unassailable 113-point lead in the championship, making him only the third driver after Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel to clinch the title with four races to spare
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ferrari's Leclerc finished the race second in front of Red Bull's Sergio Perez, but he was hit with a penalty after squeezing Perez wide and leaving the track in a late surge for the line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Verstappen was informed he had retained his title midway through the post-race TV interview, and even the driver himself was not sure if he had sealed the deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Verstappen resumed with a lead over Leclerc and Perez, and extended it as conditions gradually improved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Verstappen has won 12 of 18 races in 2022 and thanked his team for an "incredible" year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The first (championship) is a little more emotional, the second one is beautiful," he said
            </p>

                Indonesian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Febrian Ruddyard, speaks out on his country's decision to vote down an attempt to scrutinise China's human rights record at the 51st session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland on Oct 6
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the UN Human Rights Council shot down the draft resolution tabled by the US and a gaggle of allied countries and cosponsors such as Turkey, despite extensive documentation of China’s crackdown on those minorities, carried out under the guise of combating terrorism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Council rejected the draft decision entitled “debate on the situation of human rights in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, China” by a vote of 17 in favor, 19 against and 11 abstentions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China itself voted “no”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Council should focus on creating a conducive [sic] environment that encourages countries to fulfill their human rights obligations,” said Indonesia’s permanent representative to the UN, Febrian Ruddyard, at the conclusion of the vote at the UN headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Indonesia also pledged to be “resolute in its commitment to promote and protect human rights, including in Xinjiang”, the envoy added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During a press briefing in Jakarta on Friday, the Foreign Ministry’s director for human rights, Achsanul Habib, explained that there was an understanding among Human Rights Council members representing the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Muslim world’s governing body for cooperation, not to let the Council be used as a vehicle to promote “political rivalries”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amnesty International said the Xinjiang vote betrays the core mission of the Human Rights Council, with Amnesty Secretary-General Agnes Callamard saying that it “puts the UN’s main human rights body in the farcical position of ignoring findings of the UN’s own human rights office”
            </p>
            
            <p>

                As the most populous Muslim-majority nation, Indonesia’s most influential religious groups have also been coy about the alleged human rights abuse suffered by the Uighurs, especially after China organised several tightly-controlled visits for grassroots groups to Xinjiang province in an effort to dispel any doubt about its spotty human rights record
            </p>

                About Us Advertise   SINGAPORE, Oct 9 — Traffic on the Johor-Singapore Causeway came to a halt in the early hours today due a nearly four-hour power outage at Woodlands Checkpoint, leading to some drivers being redirected to the Second Link
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The unexpected outage led to the Old Woodlands Checkpoint being opened for commuters who were already on the Causeway to enter Singapore, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said in response to queries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “ICA regrets the inconvenience caused and would like to thank travellers for their understanding, patience and cooperation with officers on the ground,” ICA said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The power outage was the result of a failed backup power generator while scheduled maintenance of the power source at Woodlands Checkpoint was taking place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A backup power generator was activated to provide power during this period, but it failed at around 12.20am
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ICA said that the backup generator was tested to be working earlier in the day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “While immediate steps were taken to restore the power supply at the checkpoint, ICA immediately activated its contingency plan to manage the traffic heading towards Woodlands Checkpoint,” ICA said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ICA officers and the Traffic Police were also deployed on the Bukit Timah Expressway and Woodlands Crossing to direct vehicles in Singapore to the Tuas Checkpoint
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Travellers already on the Causeway or at the Woodlands Checkpoint were directed to the Old Woodlands Checkpoint where additional ICA officers were deployed to clear them through immigration, ICA said

            <p>
                "We welcome the resumption of live chicken broiler imports, and are seeking clarification on the details," said SFA, according to the report by CNA
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian government had earlier banned the export of up to 3.6 million chickens from Jun 1 in its efforts to tackle supply and pricing issues for chicken in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Singapore imports about 34 per cent of its chicken supply from Malaysia, almost all of which is brought in as live chickens that are then slaughtered and chilled locally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To fill the gap amid Malaysia's export ban, Singapore increased imports of chicken meat from Thailand and Indonesia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia's ban was partially lifted in mid-June to allow poultry importers in Singapore to resume bringing in live kampung and black chickens
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In August, Malaysia's Agriculture and Food Industries Minister Ronald Kiandee said after a period of chicken supply disruptions in the country, the situation has stabilised after steps taken by the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that Malaysia was in an oversupply situation and could now export chickens to other countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the CNA report - As Singapore will continue to face disruption in its food supply from time to time due to external factors, SFA said it will continue to accredit more sources of chicken and work with the industry to diversify

                "We welcome the resumption of live chicken broiler imports, and are seeking clarification on the details," said SFA, according to the report by CNA
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Malaysian government had earlier banned the export of up to 3.6 million chickens from Jun 1 in its efforts to tackle supply and pricing issues for chicken in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Singapore imports about 34 per cent of its chicken supply from Malaysia, almost all of which is brought in as live chickens that are then slaughtered and chilled locally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To fill the gap amid Malaysia's export ban, Singapore increased imports of chicken meat from Thailand and Indonesia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia's ban was partially lifted in mid-June to allow poultry importers in Singapore to resume bringing in live kampung and black chickens
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In August, Malaysia's Agriculture and Food Industries Minister Ronald Kiandee said after a period of chicken supply disruptions in the country, the situation has stabilised after steps taken by the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that Malaysia was in an oversupply situation and could now export chickens to other countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the CNA report - As Singapore will continue to face disruption in its food supply from time to time due to external factors, SFA said it will continue to accredit more sources of chicken and work with the industry to diversify

                About Us Advertise DUBAI, Oct 8 — Female students in Tehran chanted “get lost”, according to activists, as Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi visited their university campus on Saturday and condemned protesters enraged by the death of a young woman in custody
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The death of 22-year-old Amini, an Iranian Kurd, has ignited nationwide demonstrations, marking the biggest challenge to Iran’s clerical leaders in years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After a call for mass demonstrations on Saturday, security forces shot at protesters and used tear gas in the Kurdish cities of Sanandaj and Saqez, according to the Iranian human rights group Hengaw
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Sanandaj, capital of Kurdistan Province in northwest Iran, one man lay dead in his car while a woman screamed “shameless”, according to Hengaw
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the schools in Saqez city’s square was filled with school girls chanting “woman, life, freedom,” it reported
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amini was arrested in Tehran on Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hengaw said on Saturday that Iranian security forces had launched crackdowns in two Kurdish cities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Security forces are shooting at the protesters in Sanandaj and Saqez,” the group said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A university student who was on his way to join protests in Tehran said he was not afraid of being arrested or even killed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They can kill us, arrest us but we will not remain silent anymore
            </p>

                The LaLiga club beat Osasuna 2-1 away from home on Friday, although the 25-year-old defender was brandished a bizarre red card late on.  It is believed Diakhaby used inappropriate language towards the referee after being taken off by Gattuso, which resulted in the second of three sending-offs during the fiery contest

                Darko Brasanac's goal in the 93rd minute made for an interesting finale but Valencia held on to the win following Ruben Pena's red card at the death.   Amazingly, Valencia's eight competitive matches under Gattuso have resulted in nine red cards
            </p>

                The LaLiga club lost all three matches in which neither team received a red card, and yet triumphed in four out of the five in which red cards were shown to either team.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is fundamental in a player’s career

            <p>
                Both played with Ronaldo during his first spell at Old Trafford, and the pair are in agreement about his treatment under Ten Hag

                This was after the prosecution came to learn of new information that the police had received in the case of David Ong

                TODAY has sought comment from the police on what action will be taken against Ong and his daughter

            <p>
                When a police officer arrived at the scene of the accident, Ong told the officer that he was the driver of the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ong was eventually arrested on Nov 24 in 2020 and charged on Sept 7 that year
            </p>

                DPP Santhra noted that during Ong’s mitigation plea at the time, he repeated that he was responsible for the accident, which was a result of his negligence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then, in April this year, the police were alerted to the audio recording between Ong and his daughter “that contained evidence suggesting that the (Ong) was not the driver of the car” when the accident happened, DPP Santhra wrote

                Both father and daughter later admitted to the police during investigation on May 27 this year that Ms Ong was the driver of the vehicle when the collision happened

            <p>
                This information then came to the prosecution’s attention, DPP Santhra said, adding that Ong had lied to the police in 2019 “to shield Audrey Ong from prosecution”

                Thailand's king has told the families of victims of a nursery massacre that left 36 people dead that he "shares their grief" in a rare public address following one of the country's worst ever mass killings

                King Maha Vajiralongkorn met survivors and relatives at a hospital in northeastern Nong Bua Lam Phu province late on Friday, a day after an ex-policeman murdered 24 children and 12 adults on a three-hour gun and knife rampage in a sleepy rural area

                I support you all and wish you to be strong, so the spirits of the children can be at ease." The king, with Queen Suthida at his side, said he would pray for the dead

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 8 — Non-governmental organisations that work with poor communities said Budget 2023’s direct cash aid would temporarily help these groups, but lacked detailed plans to help them defeat the poverty trap
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yayasan Chow Kit’s Datuk Hartini Zainuddin argued that funds such as the RM2,500 under Bantuan Keluarga Malaysia scheme for families with five or more children, would be better spent on programmes such as workshops to help these communities save and spend wisely
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Hartini commended the government for allocating funding for the mental health for women and underprivileged communities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was referring to the RM34 million budgeted for the establishment of a National Centre of Excellence for Mental Health, and another RM8 million of funding to One-Stop Social Support Centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nevertheless, Hartini questioned how the effectiveness of the announced measures will be monitored, which was also a matter brought up by Sumitra Visvanathan, executive director of Women’s Aid Organisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Many allocations announced last year have not received sufficient monitoring and evaluation, including the D11 allocation and last year’s allocation towards introducing period products to 130,000 B40 youth to alleviate period poverty,” she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                D11 refers to the police force's sexual, women and child investigation division, which was given RM13 million in Budget 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Cash handouts, with inflation, will finish very fast
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The only thing that can really help sustain is decent jobs with better pay, working standards and social protections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We don’t know if the government has increased labour inspectors to make sure there is compliance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So yeah, cash handouts can work to a certain limit, but beyond that we really need structural reforms,” he said.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 8 — Non-governmental organisations that work with poor communities said Budget 2023’s direct cash aid would temporarily help these groups, but lacked detailed plans to help them defeat the poverty trap
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yayasan Chow Kit’s Datuk Hartini Zainuddin argued that funds such as the RM2,500 under Bantuan Keluarga Malaysia scheme for families with five or more children, would be better spent on programmes such as workshops to help these communities save and spend wisely
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Hartini commended the government for allocating funding for the mental health for women and underprivileged communities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was referring to the RM34 million budgeted for the establishment of a National Centre of Excellence for Mental Health, and another RM8 million of funding to One-Stop Social Support Centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nevertheless, Hartini questioned how the effectiveness of the announced measures will be monitored, which was also a matter brought up by Sumitra Visvanathan, executive director of Women’s Aid Organisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Many allocations announced last year have not received sufficient monitoring and evaluation, including the D11 allocation and last year’s allocation towards introducing period products to 130,000 B40 youth to alleviate period poverty,” she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                D11 refers to the police force's sexual, women and child investigation division, which was given RM13 million in Budget 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Cash handouts, with inflation, will finish very fast
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The only thing that can really help sustain is decent jobs with better pay, working standards and social protections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We don’t know if the government has increased labour inspectors to make sure there is compliance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So yeah, cash handouts can work to a certain limit, but beyond that we really need structural reforms,” he said.

            <p>
                About Us Advertise NEW YORK, Oct 8 — The Biden administration yesterday published a sweeping set of export controls, including a measure to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with US equipment, vastly expanding its reach in its bid to slow Beijing’s technological and military advances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The raft of measures could amount to the biggest shift in US policy toward shipping technology to China since the 1990s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If effective, they could hobble China’s chip manufacturing industry by forcing American and foreign companies that use US technology to cut off support for some of China’s leading factories and chip designers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “China isn’t going to give up on chipmaking ..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                but this will really slow them (down).” In a briefing with reporters on Thursday previewing the rules, senior government officials said many of the measures were aimed at preventing foreign firms from selling advanced chips to China or supplying Chinese firms with tools to make their own advanced chips
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And we risk harming US technology leadership if foreign competitors are not subject to similar controls.” The expansion of US powers to control exports to China of chips made with US tools is based on a broadening of the so-called foreign direct product rule
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, the Biden administration applied the expanded restrictions to China’s IFLYTEK, Dahua Technology, and Megvii Technology, companies added to the entity list in 2019 over allegations they aided Beijing in the suppression of its Uyghur minority group
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The rules published yesterday also block shipments of a broad array of chips for use in Chinese supercomputing systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Eric Sayers, a defence policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said the move reflects a new bid by the Biden administration to contain China’s advances instead of simply seeking to level the playing field
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new regulations will also severely restrict export of US equipment to Chinese memory chip makers and formalise letters sent to Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) restricting shipments to China of chips used in supercomputing systems that nations around the world rely on to develop nuclear weapons and other military technologies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters was first to report key details of the new restrictions on memory chip makers, including a reprieve for foreign companies operating in China and the moves to broaden restrictions on shipments to China of technologies from KLA, Lam, Applied Materials, Nvidia and AMD

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 8 — Pro-growth measures in Budget 2023 would help cushion the Malaysian economy against an expected global recession, according to economists and a trade group who lauded the overall plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, they expressed misgivings over the government’s reluctance to widen its tax base, particularly by reintroducing the goods and services tax (GST) a previous rival administration had eliminated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                UniKL Business School Assoc Prof Aimi Zulhazmi Abdul Rashid said the record RM372 billion allocations — RM40 billion more than Budget 2022 — demonstrated the government’s seriousness in ensuring the country’s economy would be in the best position possible next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This large Budget is needed to help the national economy fully recover, especially the SME (small and medium enterprises) sector, and to ensure that the domestic economy continues to be the (primary) engine next year when we are expected to face the global economic recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elaborating, Aimi said a tougher global economy next year meant domestic trade must be the growth engine for the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) and preserve jobs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The same measure for micro-SMEs would also help protect their revenue stream during the same time, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I would say that the tax cut, together with other programmes for SMEs such as grants and loan scheme, sends a signal which is the moment ‘to ride the tiger’ and this can create positive expectations which may be helpful in facing eventual economic difficulties,” Ferlito explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In particular, in the light of tax cuts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tax cuts are tremendously important, but they are one side of the coin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he registered the ACCCIM’s disappointment that the government did not announce new tax reforms to widen its tax base, such as reintroducing the GST
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We propose to the government to preannounce the implementation of GST on January, 1 2024, giving a lead time of 12 months for the preparation

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 8 — Pro-growth measures in Budget 2023 would help cushion the Malaysian economy against an expected global recession, according to economists and a trade group who lauded the overall plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, they expressed misgivings over the government’s reluctance to widen its tax base, particularly by reintroducing the goods and services tax (GST) a previous rival administration had eliminated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                UniKL Business School Assoc Prof Aimi Zulhazmi Abdul Rashid said the record RM372 billion allocations — RM40 billion more than Budget 2022 — demonstrated the government’s seriousness in ensuring the country’s economy would be in the best position possible next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This large Budget is needed to help the national economy fully recover, especially the SME (small and medium enterprises) sector, and to ensure that the domestic economy continues to be the (primary) engine next year when we are expected to face the global economic recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elaborating, Aimi said a tougher global economy next year meant domestic trade must be the growth engine for the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) and preserve jobs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The same measure for micro-SMEs would also help protect their revenue stream during the same time, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I would say that the tax cut, together with other programmes for SMEs such as grants and loan scheme, sends a signal which is the moment ‘to ride the tiger’ and this can create positive expectations which may be helpful in facing eventual economic difficulties,” Ferlito explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In particular, in the light of tax cuts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tax cuts are tremendously important, but they are one side of the coin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he registered the ACCCIM’s disappointment that the government did not announce new tax reforms to widen its tax base, such as reintroducing the GST
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We propose to the government to preannounce the implementation of GST on January, 1 2024, giving a lead time of 12 months for the preparation

            <p>
                Klopp says this is not an issue because Liverpool have several Spanish speakers and quipped Firmino’s lack of English helped him when he first arrived at Anfield

                Jürgen Klopp's new Liverpool formation could benefit many players — not just Darwin Núñez
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This in turn may lead to FSG making a bold contract decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The result of Jürgen Klopp's attempt to remedy Liverpool's poor run of form certainly paid dividends against Rangers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it wasn't just going forward where the 4-4-2 helped Liverpool to flourish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp's defence also looked a lot more compact and stable, and rarely let Rangers threaten — even on the counter, which has often been Liverpool's downfall this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only does it make Liverpool more compact in the middle, it seemed to bring the best out of Darwin Núñez, who played as the focal point of Liverpool's attack, and while the goal he sought eluded him, his performance and his positioning showed plenty of promise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another player who may benefit from the formation is Roberto Firmino, whom Klopp may have been resting for the much bigger game against Arsenal in the Premier League at the weekend

                Jürgen Klopp's new Liverpool formation could benefit many players — not just Darwin Núñez
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This in turn may lead to FSG making a bold contract decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The result of Jürgen Klopp's attempt to remedy Liverpool's poor run of form certainly paid dividends against Rangers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it wasn't just going forward where the 4-4-2 helped Liverpool to flourish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp's defence also looked a lot more compact and stable, and rarely let Rangers threaten — even on the counter, which has often been Liverpool's downfall this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only does it make Liverpool more compact in the middle, it seemed to bring the best out of Darwin Núñez, who played as the focal point of Liverpool's attack, and while the goal he sought eluded him, his performance and his positioning showed plenty of promise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another player who may benefit from the formation is Roberto Firmino, whom Klopp may have been resting for the much bigger game against Arsenal in the Premier League at the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's clear Firmino could be a focal point of the system going forward if Klopp chooses to persist with it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It will be intriguing to see whether Firmino gets the nod if Klopp decides to stick with the formation on Sunday against Arsenal
            </p>

                The Department of Education reversed course last week by quietly scaling back on eligibility for President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you owe $25K+ in student loans, there are ways to pay them off faster Too many Americans are still missing out on cheaper car insurance A TikToker paid off $17,000 in credit card debt by 'cash stuffing' — can it work for you? Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan made waves when it was first announced in August, with the promise that billions of dollars were about to be wiped from student loan records
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The department’s website originally stated that borrowers with privately held federal student loans, such as through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) and Perkins programs, could receive relief by consolidating these loans into the Direct Loan program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the guidance now specifies, that consolidation loans comprised of any FFEL or Perkins loans that aren’t held by the Education Department are only eligible for forgiveness if the borrower applied for consolidation before Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The FFEL program was shuttered in 2010, but an administration official told NPR about 800,000 borrowers would now be excluded from relief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the statement provided to NPR, that may mean FFEL borrowers could receive one-time debt relief without having to consolidate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They allege that Missouri's loan servicer is facing a “number of ongoing financial harms” by losing revenue from FFEL loans

                And with the dramatic rise in interest rates over the past few months — the Fed funds rate is currently between 3% and 3.35% — the national debt will be growing at a rate that makes it even harder to ignore

                Currently, more than $965 million is spent every day just in interest on the national debt

                Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition saga may be exhausting, but it has revealed how some business leaders are thinking privately about return-to-office mandates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Calacanis said in an exchange with Musk in April that a return-to-office mandate at Twitter—a reversal from the company’s current remote-work policy—could lead to 20% of Twitter’s staff voluntarily quitting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And according to Calacanis, they’re using return-to-office mandates to do so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Calacanis was quick to reach out to Musk after the news of his $44 billion Twitter acquisition offer first broke
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Put me in the game coach! Twitter CEO is my dream job.” Calacanis went on to argue that Twitter could meet the standards of its Big Tech peers, at least in terms of revenue per employee, if it dramatically cut staff
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a “back of the envelope” calculation, he said Twitter’s revenue per employee was just $625,000 in 2021, compared to $1.9 million per employee for Google and $2.37 million per employee for Apple—but if Musk were to cut 5,000 of Twitter’s 8,000 workers, he could increase Twitter’s revenue per employee to a “more industry standard” $1.66 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Insane potential for improvement,” Musk responded after emphasizing Calacanis’s text
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then Calacanis proposed using a return-to-office mandate to get rid of some of Twitter’s staff without having to pay the typical exit packages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Twitter’s previous CEO, Jack Dorsey, implemented a “forever” remote-work policy in 2020 that allows Twitter employees to work wherever they are most productive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “2 day a week office requirement = 20% voluntary departures,” Calacanis wrote
            </p>

                Relatives pray during a ceremony for those killed in the attack on the Young Children's Development Center in the rural town of Uthai Sawan, north eastern Thailand, on Oct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Most of the children, aged between two and five, were slashed to death, while adults were shot, police said in the aftermath of the worst child death toll in a massacre by a single killer in recent history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha was set to visit on Friday, and government officials laid royal wreaths and flowers outside the daycare centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police identified the attacker as Panya Khamrap, 34, a former police sergeant who was discharged over drug accusations and who was facing trial on a drugs charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Panya went to the daycare centre to pick up his child after attending court earlier in the day, police spokesperson Paisal Luesomboon told broadcaster ThaiPBS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When he did not find his child there, he began the killing spree
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One witness, Kittisak Polprakan, said he saw the attacker calmly walking out of the centre after the massacre, "as if he was just taking a normal stroll"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police official Chakkraphat Wichitvaidya told Reuters autopsies showed the children had been slashed with a large knife, sometimes multiple times, and adults shot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He didn’t say anything, he shot at the door while the kids were sleeping," said another woman, becoming distraught
            </p>
            
            <p>
                About 30 children were at the centre when the attack began, fewer than usual as heavy rain had kept many people away, said district official Jidapa Boonsom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hundreds of people posted condolences on the Facebook page of the Mutahi Sawant Child Development Centre under its last post before the massacre, an account of a visit the children made to a Buddhist temple in September

                Friday, 07 Oct 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Relatives pray during a ceremony for those killed in the attack on the Young Children's Development Center in the rural town of Uthai Sawan, north eastern Thailand, on Oct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Most of the children, aged between two and five, were slashed to death, while adults were shot, police said in the aftermath of the worst child death toll in a massacre by a single killer in recent history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha was set to visit on Friday, and government officials laid royal wreaths and flowers outside the daycare centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police identified the attacker as Panya Khamrap, 34, a former police sergeant who was discharged over drug accusations and who was facing trial on a drugs charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Panya went to the daycare centre to pick up his child after attending court earlier in the day, police spokesperson Paisal Luesomboon told broadcaster ThaiPBS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When he did not find his child there, he began the killing spree
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One witness, Kittisak Polprakan, said he saw the attacker calmly walking out of the centre after the massacre, "as if he was just taking a normal stroll"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police official Chakkraphat Wichitvaidya told Reuters autopsies showed the children had been slashed with a large knife, sometimes multiple times, and adults shot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He didn’t say anything, he shot at the door while the kids were sleeping," said another woman, becoming distraught
            </p>
            
            <p>
                About 30 children were at the centre when the attack began, fewer than usual as heavy rain had kept many people away, said district official Jidapa Boonsom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hundreds of people posted condolences on the Facebook page of the Mutahi Sawant Child Development Centre under its last post before the massacre, an account of a visit the children made to a Buddhist temple in September
            </p>

                In a statement, the retirement fund said the lower investment income was due to the market reaction to the elevated risk of both slower global growth and high inflation, not experienced by major economies since the 1970s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The EPF’s total gross investment income for the second quarter (2Q22) was RM11.14bil, down RM3.63bil from RM14.77bil recorded in the same quarter last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Equities continued to be the main contributor of income for 2Q22 at RM4.88bil, accounting for 44% of the total gross investment income in the quarter under review
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The consistent downtrend impacted EPF’s equity earnings, especially through global stock markets, which declined between 17% and 21% during the 1H 2022.” “Nonetheless, the EPF’s diversification into different asset classes, markets, and currencies, as prescribed in its strategic asset allocation (SAA), has helped the EPF to remain resilient against turbulent market conditions and to protect its long-term investment returns,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                EPF said this portfolio was gradually becoming more important for the EPF’s diversification efforts as the volatility in listed equity markets remained high
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fixed income instruments, comprising Malaysian Government Securities and equivalent, as well as loans and bonds, contributed a significant portion of gross investment income for 2Q22, at 42% of total income or RM4.73bil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2Q22, the EPF’s overseas investments, which make up 36% of EPF total investment assets, generated RM5.51bil in income, representing 49% of the total gross investment income recorded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taking into account the effect of the RM2.15bil that was written down for listed equities during the quarter, the EPF’s total investment income in 2Q22 was RM8.98bil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the EPF’s asset growth remained healthy as contributions received amounting to RM43.23bil as at June 2022 supported by the income generated from its investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was attributed to the strong growth of new member registrations of 177,230 in the second quarter of 2022 to a total of 323,416 for the 1H22, adding to the total number of EPF members as at June 2022 of 15.5 million

                Indonesian police said they are bringing criminal charges against three officers and three civilians for their roles in the deaths of 131 people last Saturday when police fired tear gas inside a stadium, setting off a panicked run for the exits in which many were crushed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prabowo said charges are also being brought against the chief executive of the match, the chief security officer and three police officers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Malang police head of operations is believed to have known that FIFA, the international governing body, has advised against the use of tear gas in stadiums
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "However, he did not prevent or prohibit the use of tear gas when securing the match," Prabowo said in a televised news conference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the two other police officers had ordered their subordinates to fire the tear gas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those rules don't necessarily apply to domestic or national leagues but nevertheless are a safety standard, as is the recommendation against the use of tear gas as a crowd-control measure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the defeat, angry fans rushed into the infield, prompting police to fire the tear gas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In our investigation, we found there was no emergency plan to handle special cases as is required in the Football Association of Indonesia's 2021 security and safety regulations," Prabowo said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Football Association of Indonesia has banned Arema from hosting any matches attended by its supporters in Malang until next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Indonesia President Joko Widodo said on Friday that FIFA will not impose sanctions on the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a video message, the president said Indonesia would work with FIFA to improve its management of soccer matches and that FIFA president Gianni Infantino will visit Indonesia in October or November.

            <p>
                Prabowo said charges are also being brought against the chief executive of the match, the chief security officer and three police officers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Malang police head of operations is believed to have known that FIFA, the international governing body, has advised against the use of tear gas in stadiums
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "However, he did not prevent or prohibit the use of tear gas when securing the match," Prabowo said in a televised news conference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the two other police officers had ordered their subordinates to fire the tear gas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those rules don't necessarily apply to domestic or national leagues but nevertheless are a safety standard, as is the recommendation against the use of tear gas as a crowd-control measure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the defeat, angry fans rushed into the infield, prompting police to fire the tear gas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In our investigation, we found there was no emergency plan to handle special cases as is required in the Football Association of Indonesia's 2021 security and safety regulations," Prabowo said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Football Association of Indonesia has banned Arema from hosting any matches attended by its supporters in Malang until next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Indonesia President Joko Widodo said on Friday that FIFA will not impose sanctions on the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a video message, the president said Indonesia would work with FIFA to improve its management of soccer matches and that FIFA president Gianni Infantino will visit Indonesia in October or November.

                One technology expert said to avoid getting spam calls, stop giving out your phone number

                One technology expert said to avoid getting spam calls, stop giving out your phone number
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The challenge with smartphone phone numbers is that people are using them as their primary number and you get into the habit of giving that number out to everyone,” Kelso said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And in the case of handing out your phone number to everyone, there is a good chance that your cellphone number will be leaked in a large-scale data breach.” Shawn Kobzej also has been struggling with spam calls and said this is what happened to him a couple of months ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “My phone just wouldn’t stop ringing all day long and it was just terribly annoying.” Along with not giving out personal numbers, Kelso said people can set up a second, free number through companies like WhatsApp or Google voice or talk to phone companies about programs to reduce robocalls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After phone numbers are in the hands of scammers, Kelso said cybercriminals can spoof, or mimic, numbers and use them to call people in that area, making the call seem more realistic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Doyle asked his phone company what he can do about this but hasn’t acted on anything yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They said, of course, you can change your phone number, but I mean, we’re just not really in the place where we can do that,” Doyle said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kelso said the reason cybercriminals do this is to get victims to react

            <p>
                “Voicemail is probably your best friend because at least then you know if it’s a legitimate call, someone is going to leave a voicemail message for you to call back,” Kelso said

                About Us Advertise BEIJING, Oct 7 — When Xi Jinping took power in 2012, some observers predicted he would be the most liberal Communist Party leader in China’s history, based on his low-key profile, family backstory and perhaps a degree of misguided hope
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chan, author of a book on Xi’s life, told AFP

                “He really has a vision about China, he wants to see China as the most powerful country in the world.” Central to that vision — what Xi calls the “Chinese Dream” or “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” — is the role of the Communist Party (CCP)

            <p>
                Beginning as a village party boss in 1974, Xi climbed to the governorship of coastal Fujian province in 1999, then party chief of Zhejiang province in 2002 and eventually Shanghai in 2007

                IT was reported that travellers arriving in or leaving Malaysia will now have to fill up Customs declaration forms

            <p>
                CAAM chief executive officer Datuk Capt Chester Voo said the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) through a letter dated Sept 5 stated that the declaration of Customs Form No
            </p>
            
            <p>
                7 (K7) is a requirement under Section 103 of the Custom Act 1967
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "To comply with the provisions of this legislation for passengers arriving in Malaysia by air, RMCD requests the cooperation of all airlines entering Malaysia to make announcements to all passengers on the requirement to fill up Form K7 and to submit it to the duty officer of Customs at the airport," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                CAAM has even provided a sample announcement to be made on the flight before the plane lands in Malaysia, both in English and Malay

            <p>
                "The declaration shall be made by using Customs Form No

            <p>
                "Any false declarations or failure to declare is an offence under Malaysian law." On the decision, Voo said that every passenger or other person arriving in or leaving Malaysia shall declare all dutiable or prohibited goods in his possession, either on his person or in any baggage or in any vehicle, to the proper officer of Customs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                55 of the Customs Regulation 2019, every traveller or other person arriving in or leaving Malaysia shall declare in Form Customs No.7 in the Third Schedule," he said in a statement on Tuesday (Oct 4)

                Calls for the non-Bumiputera matriculation quota to be increased from 10 per cent may echo, now and then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, we must broaden the definition of who ‘deserves’ to get admission or scholarships
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is difficult to deny that they should be given a chance to pursue their education programme of choice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We also reduce academic ability to exam results
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Does higher education open enough space for them? Second, we need to go beyond demanding more non-Bumiputera spaces in matriculation colleges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, while a larger non-Bumiputera quota in matriculation (currently 10%) seems a morally appealing and pragmatic solution, this will cause a rush of already high-scoring Chinese and Indian students into this easier pre-university programme, and exacerbate inequalities within the community by compounding the disadvantage of those who miss out on the matriculation spots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Would those who object to preferential treatment for Bumiputeras also object to preferential treatment for Orang Asli university applicants? The solution is not to sweepingly abolish ethnicity-conscious admissions, but to strike a balance of academic, socioeconomic and student diversity considerations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, how can Malaysia do better? First, matriculation and STPM must be revamped — basically made more rigorous, with a focus on equipping students for higher education instead of providing an easier pathway to university
            </p>
            
            <p>
                System-wide change, including the prospect of a single university entrance examination, is not feasible until we narrow the quality gap in the parallel university entry programmes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Admission to university is surely too important to be left to a computer algorithm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A further round of selection can be formulated to balance out student diversity — not just by ethnicity, but also region, language, and other aspects

                The roster’s only appearance at LAN this year was at the PGL Arlington Major, where they had the dubious honor of being the last team in the group stage, because there were only 17 teams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in that very tournament, they were also the only team to take a game off PSG.LGD in the group stage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the team has slowly assembled their team, piece by piece

                Every team at TI11 can be a potential hurdle

            <p>
                That said, this team is just one person removed from the team that finished second in both Majors in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why does the North American team remain a force to watch out for? At their best, the team has shown themselves to be a team chock-full of individual talent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team achieved silver at Stockholm Major in a run that felt less miraculous and more like they understood the meta intimately — a good sign for a team able to evolve with the tournament

                The roster’s only appearance at LAN this year was at the PGL Arlington Major, where they had the dubious honor of being the last team in the group stage, because there were only 17 teams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in that very tournament, they were also the only team to take a game off PSG.LGD in the group stage

                That said, this team is just one person removed from the team that finished second in both Majors in 2021

            <p>
                So why does the North American team remain a force to watch out for? At their best, the team has shown themselves to be a team chock-full of individual talent

                The team achieved silver at Stockholm Major in a run that felt less miraculous and more like they understood the meta intimately — a good sign for a team able to evolve with the tournament

                About Us Advertise GENEVA, Oct 7 — The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday voted against debating alleged widespread abuses in China’s Xinjiang region after intense lobbying by Beijing, in a heavy setback for Western nations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The United States and allies last month brought a draft decision targeting China to the UN’s top rights body, seeking as a bare minimum a discussion on Xinjiang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move came after former UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet released her long-delayed Xinjiang report, citing possible crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the far-western region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in a moment of knife-edge drama, countries on the 47-member council in Geneva voted 19-17 against holding a debate on human rights in Xinjiang, with 11 nations abstaining
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amnesty International branded the vote farcical, while Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it betrayed abuse victims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The United States condemns today’s vote preventing a discussion about Xinjiang,” US ambassador to the council Michele Taylor tweeted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Washington and some Western countries have used Xinjiang “to spread rumours and cause trouble, engaging in political manipulation under the guise of human rights, attempting to smear China’s image,” a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One Western diplomat stressed that regardless of the outcome, “the number one objective has been fulfilled” in putting Xinjiang in the spotlight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amnesty secretary general Agnes Callamard said Thursday’s vote put the council in “the farcical position of ignoring the findings of the UN’s own human rights office”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “For council member states to vote against even discussing a situation where the UN itself says crimes against humanity may have occurred makes a mockery of everything the Human Rights Council is supposed to stand for.” HRW’s China director Sophie Richardson called it an “abdication of responsibility and a betrayal of Uyghur victims”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China launched an all-out offensive to dismiss Bachelet’s report

                About Us Advertise NEW YORK, Oct 7 — A rebound of Covid-19 symptoms in some patients after taking Pfizer’s antiviral Paxlovid may be related to a robust immune response rather than a weak one, US government researchers reported on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All patients in the study had developed robust immune responses, but researchers found higher levels of antibodies in the patients who experienced a rebound
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our findings suggest that a more robust immune response rather than uncontrolled viral replication characterizes these clinical rebounds,” the team wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anthony Fauci both experienced a Covid rebound after taking the medicine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The study involved six people whose Covid symptoms returned after taking Paxlovid, and two with rebound symptoms after apparent recovery who did not take the pills
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Their responses were compared to a group of six people who had Covid but did not experience a rebound
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Blood from study volunteers underwent intensive investigation to assess their immune response during the acute infection phase and the rebound phase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of the rebound patients had experienced significant improvement in their symptoms before their rebound
            </p>
            
            <p>
                None of the rebound patients required additional treatment or hospitalisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rebound symptoms may be partially driven by a robust immune response to residual virus in the respiratory tract, the study authors suggested
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They concluded that the drug does not impede the immune response in some individuals, as some had feared

                About Us Advertise NEW YORK, Oct 7 — A rebound of Covid-19 symptoms in some patients after taking Pfizer’s antiviral Paxlovid may be related to a robust immune response rather than a weak one, US government researchers reported on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All patients in the study had developed robust immune responses, but researchers found higher levels of antibodies in the patients who experienced a rebound
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our findings suggest that a more robust immune response rather than uncontrolled viral replication characterizes these clinical rebounds,” the team wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anthony Fauci both experienced a Covid rebound after taking the medicine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The study involved six people whose Covid symptoms returned after taking Paxlovid, and two with rebound symptoms after apparent recovery who did not take the pills
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Their responses were compared to a group of six people who had Covid but did not experience a rebound
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Blood from study volunteers underwent intensive investigation to assess their immune response during the acute infection phase and the rebound phase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of the rebound patients had experienced significant improvement in their symptoms before their rebound
            </p>
            
            <p>
                None of the rebound patients required additional treatment or hospitalisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rebound symptoms may be partially driven by a robust immune response to residual virus in the respiratory tract, the study authors suggested
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They concluded that the drug does not impede the immune response in some individuals, as some had feared

                A woman reacts as people gather outside a day care center which was the scene of a mass shooting, in the town of Uthai Sawan, around 500 km northeast of Bangkok in the province of Nong Bua Lam Phu, Thailand October 6, 2022

            <p>
                Most of the children who died at the daycare centre in Uthai Sawan, a town 500 km (310 miles) northeast of Bangkok, on Thursday were stabbed to death, police said, marking one of the worst child death tolls in a massacre by a single killer in recent history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the attack, he went home and shot dead his wife and child before turning his weapon on himself

            <p>
                The age range of children at the daycare centre ranged from two to five years, a local official said

                From the first step when I went in, it felt harrowing," Piyalak Kingkaew, an emergency worker heading the first responder team, told Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We’ve been through it before, but this incident is most harrowing because they are little kids."   The former policeman had been in court earlier in the day and had then gone to the daycare centre to collect his child, police spokesperson Paisal Luesomboon told broadcaster ThaiPBS

            <p>
                "I don't know (why he did this), but he was under a lot of pressure," Panya's mother told Nation TV, citing debt the former policeman had clocked up and his drug taking

            <p>

                Most of the children, aged between two and five, were slashed to death, while adults were shot, police said in the aftermath of the worst child death toll in a massacre by a single killer in recent history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha was set to visit on Friday, and government officials laid royal wreaths and flowers outside the daycare centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police identified the attacker as Panya Khamrap, 34, a former police sergeant who was discharged over drug accusations and who was facing trial on a drugs charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Panya went to the daycare centre to pick up his child after attending court earlier in the day, police spokesperson Paisal Luesomboon told broadcaster ThaiPBS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When he did not find his child there, he began the killing spree
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One witness, Kittisak Polprakan, said he saw the attacker calmly walking out of the centre after the massacre, "as if he was just taking a normal stroll"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police official Chakkraphat Wichitvaidya told Reuters autopsies showed the children had been slashed with a large knife, sometimes multiple times, and adults shot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He didn’t say anything, he shot at the door while the kids were sleeping," said another woman, becoming distraught

            <p>
                About 30 children were at the centre when the attack began, fewer than usual as heavy rain had kept many people away, said district official Jidapa Boonsom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hundreds of people posted condolences on the Facebook page of the Mutahi Sawant Child Development Centre under its last post before the massacre, an account of a visit the children made to a Buddhist temple in September

            </p>
            
            <p>
                When he did not find his child there, he began the killing spree
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One witness, Kittisak Polprakan, said he saw the attacker calmly walking out of the centre after the massacre, "as if he was just taking a normal stroll"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police official Chakkraphat Wichitvaidya told Reuters autopsies showed the children had been slashed with a large knife, sometimes multiple times, and adults shot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He didn’t say anything, he shot at the door while the kids were sleeping," said another woman, becoming distraught
            </p>
            
            <p>
                About 30 children were at the centre when the attack began, fewer than usual as heavy rain had kept many people away, said district official Jidapa Boonsom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hundreds of people posted condolences on the Facebook page of the Mutahi Sawant Child Development Centre under its last post before the massacre, an account of a visit the children made to a Buddhist temple in September

                A woman reacts as people gather outside a day care center which was the scene of a mass shooting, in the town of Uthai Sawan, around 500 km northeast of Bangkok in the province of Nong Bua Lam Phu, Thailand October 6, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After leaving the daycare centre filled with dead, dying and wounded, the ex-officer went home and shot dead his wife and son before turning his weapon on himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police identified the attacker as Panya Khamrap, 34, a former police sergeant who had been discharged over drug allegations and who was facing trial on a drugs charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An autopsy report indicated he had not used them on the day of the attack, national police chief Damrongsak Kittipraphat said on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One witness, Kittisak Polprakan, said he saw the attacker calmly walking out of the daycare centre - a pink, one-storey building surrounded by a lawn and small palm trees - after the massacre "as if he was just taking a normal stroll"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Most of the children, aged between two and five, were slashed to death, while adults were shot, police said in the aftermath of one of the world's worst child death tolls in a massacre by a single killer in recent history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government would try its best to take care of the families and the prime minister asked everyone to "be strong to get through this great loss," said government spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri
            </p>
            
            <p>

                With a trip to league-leaders Arsenal on Sunday, what is really going on with Liverpool's right-back?  The big difference between Liverpool this year and Liverpool last year seems to be how vulnerable they are without the ball
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team had to win the ball high up the field because every time the opposition entered their defensive third, it would end in disaster
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, they're allowing 1.3 goals per game -- the worst rate of the Klopp era and a significant uptick from last season's 0.7, which was the best mark of the Klopp era
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And then the third goal against Brighton and the one goal for Newcastle both fall in category 4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How does that compare to last season? With TAA on the field in 2021-22, Liverpool allowed 16 open-play goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's all of category 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If we say categories 1 and 2 are "plays you can get mad at TAA for if you really want to," then there have been three this season and there were five last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's a much higher rate than last season, but these are still such small numbers -- one mis-hit shot or save, and we're talking one goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first is that they're drawing opponents offside 1.9 times per game -- the fewest in the Klopp era -- after a Klopp-era high of 3.8 last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On a per-90 basis, he's dropped from 0.35 xA last season to 0.12 this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he's also second in the league in passes into the penalty area and first in the league in crosses into the penalty -- both at increased rates from last season

                When Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob took over the premiership in August last year, he retained the former corporate leader as the minister in charge of finance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also, with a global economic recession expected next year, much appears to be riding on the next budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tengku Zafrul was earlier reported to have said that Budget 2023 would prioritise maintaining the current economic recovery momentum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had said the Budget would continue with reforms to improve the people’s welfare, and build resilience to ensure the nation was ready for future challenges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was initial talk that the Prime Minister himself would be tabling the Budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The talk came following the claim by Muhyiddin, who is Perikatan Nasional as well as National Recovery Council chairman, that Budget 2023 would be tabled by Ismail Sabri
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it is learnt that procedure dictates that it is the duty of the Finance Minister to do so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previous prime ministers had presented the Federal Government’s annual budget as they simultaneously held the finance portfolio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While there is much anticipation that this will be a populist budget given the imminent GE15, it remains to be seen how much of the goodies the government will roll out for the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Several economists are of the view that the government needs to maintain a small budget after a series of aid was announced to cushion the impact of the pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The government should avoid a populist budget that could disrupt the market, weaken the ringgit and put pressure on interest rates,” said a market analyst

            <p>
                When Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob took over the premiership in August last year, he retained the former corporate leader as the minister in charge of finance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also, with a global economic recession expected next year, much appears to be riding on the next budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tengku Zafrul was earlier reported to have said that Budget 2023 would prioritise maintaining the current economic recovery momentum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had said the Budget would continue with reforms to improve the people’s welfare, and build resilience to ensure the nation was ready for future challenges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was initial talk that the Prime Minister himself would be tabling the Budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The talk came following the claim by Muhyiddin, who is Perikatan Nasional as well as National Recovery Council chairman, that Budget 2023 would be tabled by Ismail Sabri
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it is learnt that procedure dictates that it is the duty of the Finance Minister to do so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previous prime ministers had presented the Federal Government’s annual budget as they simultaneously held the finance portfolio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While there is much anticipation that this will be a populist budget given the imminent GE15, it remains to be seen how much of the goodies the government will roll out for the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Several economists are of the view that the government needs to maintain a small budget after a series of aid was announced to cushion the impact of the pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The government should avoid a populist budget that could disrupt the market, weaken the ringgit and put pressure on interest rates,” said a market analyst
            </p>

                Tuan Ibrahim, who is also the Environment and Water Minister, said the letter was sent on Wednesday night after a meeting of all the party components of Perikatan in Shah Alam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He confirmed that the palace had received the letter on the same night

            <p>
                At a Perikatan event on Wednesday night, it was revealed that the letter dated Oct 3 was signed by the 12 Cabinet ministers of Bersatu and PAS to state that they were against the general election being held this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The letter stated the Meteorological Department’s forecast of a severe monsoon and to allow the nation’s economy to recover

            <p>
                Perikatan has repeatedly stated they disagreed with holding the polls during the flood season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PAS has even decided that all three state assemblies under its rule will not be dissolved until the monsoon is over in March next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Later in the evening, Perikatan component party heads once again met for their presidential council at Bersatu’s headquarters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bersatu deputy president Datuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu, who is also the Sports and Youth Minister, said that it was a scheduled meeting between the component party heads of Perikatan and was nothing out of the extraordinary

                Despite showing his quality during his three starts for the club, Vieira has only featured on two other occasions as a late substitue in games against Manchester United and Tottenham.  Vieira finds himself behind club captain Martin Odegaard in the pecking order at Arsenal in his favoured No 10 role, raising questions about how much he will play this season

                The 22-year-old joined from Porto for £34m and also scored on his first Premier League start  'At these types of clubs there's always going to be competition,' Cole told BT Sport

            <p>
                Odegaard is the club captain now but he (Arteta) left them on the pitch together at the end so there's quite a good battle to see which one comes through now.  'This is where the Europa League is absolutely perfect as it gives them (Arsenal) an opportunity to nurture the players

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 — The prime minister did not require the Cabinet’s agreement to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to dissolve Parliament, constitutional experts said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is arguable that the doctrine applies in the case of requesting to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It can also be argued collective responsibility only apply to general accountability of government to Parliament but not to the dissolution of Parliament,” he said when contacted by Malay Mail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Article 40 of the Federal Constitution holds that the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall act on the advice of Cabinet in the execution of his constitutional powers, although Article 40(2)(b) provides him with discretionary powers with regards to the dissolution of Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Article 55 further states that the Agong has the power to dismiss or dissolve Parliament, but does not specify that this must be on the advice of the Cabinet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nik Ahmad Kamal said that while the prime minister should rightly consult the Cabinet before proposing to dissolve Parliament, his ministers’ view did not have any legal bearing on his decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bar Council constitutional law committee co-chair Andrew Khoo explained that while it was not expressly stated, it was the convention that the prime minister has the absolute discretion to advise the Agong to dissolve the Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While consulting the Cabinet before proposing to dissolve Parliament would be politically important for a prime minister, Khoo believed it was not legally required
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But now, if the PM advises [the Agong] for the dissolution of Parliament, it does not yet represent the entire Cabinet of ministers representing the government

                Medical Properties Trust stock pays a monthly dividend of 29 cents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s well above its recent price near $11.60
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While that could potentially trigger a dividend cut, Medical Properties Trust is well-diversified and should be able to weather that storm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s also possible that a potential cut is already baked into the stock price, and should Medical Properties Trust not cut the dividend, the price could rebound

                Gladstone Commercial pays an annual dividend of 81 cents, yielding 9.5%

            <p>
                There are no recent analyst ratings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Looking ahead, Gladstone Commercial should be able to maintain its dividend

            <p>
                EPR Properties pays a monthly dividend of $0.275
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current annual yield is 9.1%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That still represents a 51% upside from its recent price of $36.20
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment it would appear that the dividend is not at risk for a cut

                With United stunningly trailing to a first-half goal from Karim Ansarifard, Rashford came on at the interval and scored one and set up another for Anthony Martial to turn the game on its head within 20 minutes of his arrival

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 6 — There is no clause in the Malaysian Halal Certification Procedure Manual (Domestic) 2020 and the Malaysian Halal Management System 2020 which stipulates that hotels or premises must display the “non-halal lift” sign

            <p>
                Earlier it was reported that the management of a hotel stated that the premises had put up a “non-halal lift” sticker in the lift which was used to carry non-halal and perishable goods

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 6 — There is no clause in the Malaysian Halal Certification Procedure Manual (Domestic) 2020 and the Malaysian Halal Management System 2020 which stipulates that hotels or premises must display the “non-halal lift” sign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Jakim would like to refer to a media report regarding a hotel in Kuala Lumpur that put a ‘non-halal lift’ sign on one of its elevators to move non-halal perishable goods
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier it was reported that the management of a hotel stated that the premises had put up a “non-halal lift” sticker in the lift which was used to carry non-halal and perishable goods
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hotel had issued a statement saying it was part of the halal certification requirements

            <p>
                A financial advisor may help you understand how to manage the tax repercussions of your RMDs.  Take RMDs Correctly No matter your age, there are proactive steps you can take to prepare for the RMD tax bite
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tax-deferred accounts are individual accounts, and RMDs cannot be covered for one spouse by taking a distribution from another spouse's account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you only have a single IRA or 401(k), you can focus on the amount to distribute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This provision of the tax code allows account holders to distribute funds directly from their IRAs to a qualified charity, removing the distribution from taxable income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                tax system is progressive, meaning the higher your taxable income, the more tax you pay on each dollar of income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This can significantly reduce the amount of taxes paid once RMDs begin

                By Tom Polansek CHICAGO (Reuters) -Tyson Foods Inc is joining other corporate heavyweights in moving jobs out of Illinois
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is the latest shakeup for Tyson, which has about 1,000 corporate employees in the Chicago-area and South Dakota offices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tyson said it will begin a "phased relocation" of the corporate employees early next year and that the move will benefit collaboration and decision making

                Tyson said in August that an expansion project at a Caseyville, Illinois, plant will create 250 jobs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, Tyson's decision deals another blow to Chicago's business community after hedge fund Citadel said in June it was moving its global headquarters from the city to Miami
            </p>

                About Us Advertise GENEVA, Oct 7 — The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday voted against debating alleged widespread abuses in China’s Xinjiang region after intense lobbying by Beijing, in a heavy setback for Western nations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The United States and allies last month brought a draft decision targeting China to the UN’s top rights body, seeking as a bare minimum a discussion on Xinjiang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move came after former UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet released her long-delayed Xinjiang report, citing possible crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the far-western region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in a moment of knife-edge drama, countries on the 47-member council in Geneva voted 19-17 against holding a debate on human rights in Xinjiang, with 11 nations abstaining
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amnesty International branded the vote farcical, while Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it betrayed abuse victims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The United States condemns today’s vote preventing a discussion about Xinjiang,” US ambassador to the council Michele Taylor tweeted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Washington and some Western countries have used Xinjiang “to spread rumours and cause trouble, engaging in political manipulation under the guise of human rights, attempting to smear China’s image,” a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One Western diplomat stressed that regardless of the outcome, “the number one objective has been fulfilled” in putting Xinjiang in the spotlight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amnesty secretary general Agnes Callamard said Thursday’s vote put the council in “the farcical position of ignoring the findings of the UN’s own human rights office”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “For council member states to vote against even discussing a situation where the UN itself says crimes against humanity may have occurred makes a mockery of everything the Human Rights Council is supposed to stand for.” HRW’s China director Sophie Richardson called it an “abdication of responsibility and a betrayal of Uyghur victims”

                Haaland has started his Manchester City career in breathtaking form, scoring 19 goals in just 11 games in the Premier League and Champions League so far this season  With 19 goals already this season, teams have been left scrambling to find a way to stop Manchester City striker Erling Haaland

            <p>
                An account named 'Ten Hag's Reds!' has set up a petition on website Change in a bid to get Haaland banned from playing football altogether

            </p>
            
            <p>
                District Judge Kow Keng Siong said that when a crime has been committed on a cruise ship operating from Singapore involving Singapore citizens and residents, Singapore's criminal law must have the ability to bring the perpetrator to justice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng faces one charge of housebreaking for climbing over the balcony of the victim's cabin and then entering her cabin to commit theft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also faces a charge of theft for stealing the victim's bra and a piece of her luggage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was agreed that the legal issue - whether the Act has the effect of extending Singapore's criminal law to extraterritorial acts committed on foreign ships - should be determined before proceeding with his trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the course of arguments, a question arose over which provision under the Act should have been used
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution said it chose section 180 as it extended Singapore criminal law to extraterritorial acts, and also conferred jurisdiction on the Singapore courts to try the charges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Judge Kow said section 178 ought to be stated as the applicable provision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He concluded that section 178 extended Singapore's criminal law to acts committed on foreign ships outside Singapore, while section 180 gave Singapore courts the authority to try offences committed outside Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The housebreaking charge carries up to 10 years' jail and a fine, while the theft charge carries up to seven years' jail and a fine.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am a member of the Cabinet, there is a notice for tomorrow..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                the weekly meeting is usually held on Wednesday, but because Parliament is in session, it is held on Friday,” Astro Awani reported him as saying during a Special Task Force on Jihad against Inflation press conference at Parliament on Thursday (Oct 6)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s a Cabinet meeting tomorrow, Parliament is not dissolved yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The outcome of today’s results (PM’s audience with the King) will be brought forward to tomorrow because the Cabinet (agreement) must be asked, so the issue of dissolution does not arise, because Cabinet is convening tomorrow,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that he was not in the know regarding when Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri would announce the dissolution of Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In the Cabinet, we don’t vote on the matter of whether to dissolve or not dissolve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Still, as per the law, parties do not dissolve Parliament,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister can advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, when you read the Constitution, only the King can dissolve Parliament, and His Majesty can accept or decline,” said Annuar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “All party members must agree with the party’s decision,” said Annuar.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am a member of the Cabinet, there is a notice for tomorrow..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                the weekly meeting is usually held on Wednesday, but because Parliament is in session, it is held on Friday,” Astro Awani reported him as saying during a Special Task Force on Jihad against Inflation press conference at Parliament on Thursday (Oct 6)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s a Cabinet meeting tomorrow, Parliament is not dissolved yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The outcome of today’s results (PM’s audience with the King) will be brought forward to tomorrow because the Cabinet (agreement) must be asked, so the issue of dissolution does not arise, because Cabinet is convening tomorrow,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that he was not in the know regarding when Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri would announce the dissolution of Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In the Cabinet, we don’t vote on the matter of whether to dissolve or not dissolve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Still, as per the law, parties do not dissolve Parliament,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister can advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, when you read the Constitution, only the King can dissolve Parliament, and His Majesty can accept or decline,” said Annuar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “All party members must agree with the party’s decision,” said Annuar.

                Azmin noted that whoever forms the new government after the 15th General Election (GE15) would implement the CPTPP

            <p>
                He also said 11 laws were already amended which would allow the country to fulfill its obligations under the CPTPP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, to a question by Wong Hon Wai (PH-Bukit Bendera), Azmin said Malaysia has ratified the CPTPP and officially submitted the instrument of ratification with the CPTPP depositary in New Zealand on Sept 30
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The CPTPP is considered ratified for Malaysia and it will come into force on Nov 29 this year," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The CPTPP was signed on March 8, 2018 and had been ratified and implemented in stages by Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam and Peru
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The agreement would allow Malaysia to gain priority access to new markets in Canada, Mexico and Peru

            <p>
                Apart from the CPTPP, Azmin said Malaysia and Turkiye inked an agreement on Sept 29 to expand bilateral trade in the service, e-commerce and investment sectors

            <p>
                She added that the boy’s 29-year-old mother, who works as a hypermarket sales assistant, was too shattered to speak to anyone

                Commenting on the incident, Johor Baru North Deputy OCPD Supt Fariz Ammar Abdullah said the family arrived at the restaurant at around 2pm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The boy was said to have suddenly kicked the table, tipping the baby chair over
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The father rushed the boy to a nearby private clinic, where the doctor advised him to seek help at  a hospital due to the toddler’s  injuries

            </p>
            
            <p>
                She added that the boy’s 29-year-old mother, who works as a hypermarket sales assistant, was too shattered to speak to anyone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The body, the relative said, would be placed at his family home in Taman Universiti before the funeral today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She declined to disclose where the boy would be buried

            <p>
                Commenting on the incident, Johor Baru North Deputy OCPD Supt Fariz Ammar Abdullah said the family arrived at the restaurant at around 2pm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The boy was said to have suddenly kicked the table, tipping the baby chair over
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The father rushed the boy to a nearby private clinic, where the doctor advised him to seek help at  a hospital due to the toddler’s  injuries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When the father took the boy to a private hospital in Iskandar Puteri, the child was pronounced dead by a medical officer there,” said Supt Fariz Ammar

                Thursday, 06 Oct 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has filed an application for leave to initiate a judicial review of the Prisons Department’s decision to turn down his request to attend the Dewan Rakyat meeting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the notice of application, the Pekan MP named the government, the Home Minister and the Commissioner-General of Prisons as the first, second and third respondents, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his supporting affidavit, Najib said the department had rejected his request, citing “security grounds”, on Sept 28
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then appealed to the Home Minister on Sept 30, along with a request for a quick decision, as the Parliament meeting began on Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, there has been no response from the Home Minister so far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib, who has been Pekan MP since 1976, said he had been adversely affected by the refusal to let him have access to his officers and aides for the purposes of parliamentary, legislative and constituent work as well as access and attendance in Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib, who was convicted and sentenced in the RM42mil SRC International Sdn Bhd case, said that although his appeal was dismissed at the Federal Court, he remains as Pekan MP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said he is entitled to retain his status as Pekan MP until his petition for a royal pardon and review of the Federal Court’s dismissal of his appeal is decided
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is seeking for an order of certiorari to quash the commissioner-general’s refusal as well as a court declaration that he is entitled to have access to his constituency and Parliament

                Michael Owen had held the record, taking him 48 games.   Erling Haaland has trounced all before him since arriving in the Premier League this summer The raw statistics lay bare what a mockery of the Premier League Haaland is making at the moment

                One-time boy wonder Michael Owen held the record for the fewest number of games to score three Premier League hat-tricks Salah's Premier League season record - 32 goals  Having been cast out by Chelsea, Mohamed Salah returned to the Premier League with a vengeance after rebuilding his career at Roma.  In his first proper season in England, Salah broke through all before him, scoring 32 league goals as Liverpool finally began to look like a force to be reckoned with both domestically and in Europe.  His season was most notable for his performances in Europe, guiding Liverpool to their first Champions League final since 2007, but his league tally ensured he put himself above Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez in enjoying the most prolific 38-game Premier League season ever.  Haaland could trump his record in 20 games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamed Salah could soon see his 38-game Premier League goal-scoring record beaten Should the Manchester City forward continue scoring at his current rate of 1.75 goals per game, Salah's record could be gone by the time the champions travel to Manchester United on January 14.  Nobody needs any reminder what Haaland did to Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez in their most recent fixture.  Even factoring in some sort of second half of the season slow down, Haaland could conceivably have wrapped up the record by the time the Champions League roles around again in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Son Heung-min was emotional after sharing the golden boot last term - Haaland could soon have surpassed the South Korean's tally All-time Premier League goal scoring record - 260 goals  There has been much debate over whether or not Alan Shearer's record of 260 goals can ever be broken
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former Newcastle and England striker's final goal in the league came on April 17, 2006, fittingly against Sunderland.  Haaland's arrival, and his start to life in the Premier League, now has supporters questioning whether it is a case of when, not if.  Should he continue hitting the back of the net at his astonishing rate, Shearer's record will be matched within 141 games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Harry Kane, the likeliest candidate at present to trouble Shearer's record, has scored his 190 Premier League goals in 290 appearances at a rate of 0.66
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he could edge himself further up the Catalan's stellar list of players coached by getting close to Messi's league goalscoring record.  Haaland could surpass the tally with games to spare at his current rate - nine to be exact.  The Argentine scored seven hat-tricks that season, Haaland could match that figure after just 15 games.   Lionel Messi (R) enjoyed a miraculous season in 2011-12, notching 50 goals alone in the league English single season goalscoring record - 60 goals A statistic that has survived pretty much all the major events in modern history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only 36 fixtures to surpass the legendary Everton forward.  Many questioned whether or not Haaland would adapt to life quickly in the Premier League after a difficult start to life in the Community Shield against Liverpool at the end of July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How laughable those doubts look now.  Injury free, why can't he challenge one of English football's most esteemed records?  Haaland is looking to break Dixie Dean's record for most goals in a single English season of 60 - a record that has stood since 1928

                In a press conference broadcast on his Facebook page on Thursday (Oct 6), the PKR deputy president said this was alongside nominations from its members and leaders to help the party widen its talent pool

                The website has been launched today and will be online until next Thursday

            <p>
                He said those who fill in the nomination forms will be subject to certain conditions under the official website and they will go through a screening process by the nomination committee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "A scoring system will be used by the nomination committee to rank the candidates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because only the top five candidates will be discussed by the nomination committee and their candidacy will be decided by the president and myself as the party election director
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, Rafizi said, online nominations are open for all 222 parliamentary and state assembly seats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "But we know that PKR will only compete in certain seats when the seat negotiation process ends next week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If the competition between the candidates is balanced, PKR's central elections department will conduct a final process which is a telephone survey to evaluate the candidate by contacting voters in the area, that is around 500 to 600 people," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi also said that individuals nominated by the party branches or wings will be given additional marks in the evaluation process since they are believed to have the ability to help the party in the election.

                The Selangor Sultan, who is also the National Council of Islamic Religious Affairs (MKI) chairman, said the MKI muzakarah committee played a very important role and function in the Muslim community in Malaysia and is a tower of legal reference at the national and international levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, since each state had its own fatwa committee, there is bound to be conflicts between state fatwas and muzakarah decisions at the national level as well as between one state and another
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This legal ruling by the muzakarah committee is a collective ijtihad (ijtihad jama'i) of all the muftis of the states assisted by experts in certain fields," said Sultan Sharafuddin in his speech during the 121st MKI muzakarah committee meeting at Masjid Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, Shah Alam, Selangor on Wednesday (Oct 6)

            <p>
                Sultan Sharafuddin added that the coordination and standardisation of fatwas by the muzakarah committee do not touch or affect the authority of the Sultan and Rulers in the states as the Head of Religion, as stated by Regulation 9 (1) of the MKI Regulations 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to procedure, the decisions and views of the muzakarah committee would be informed to the MKI, which was chaired by Sultan Sharafuddin

            <p>
                "This is important to ensure that muzakarah decisions at the national level and fatwas at the state level are not influenced by elements of party politics," said Sultan Sharafuddin

                Cheah Tek Kuang, who is currently a non-independent and non-executive director of the bank, went over to the Pekan MP’s home in Langgak Duta as he was tasked to get Najib’s signature for various forms to open a current account with AmBank

            <p>
                As he arrived at the residence in a car, Cheah said that Low, better known as Jho Low, came out from another car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To a question by Najib’s lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah during the RM2.28bil 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) trial yesterday, Cheah said Low did not interact with him

            <p>
                The witness also testified that prior to the meeting at Najib’s home, he had met Low before as Low had wanted to meet with him as the bank’s managing director
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                “But he has a habit of turning up late,” he said, adding that Low would be late for more than 30 minutes

                After two or three meetings, where Low still turned up late, Cheah said he did not entertain further meeting requests from Low
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday, Cheah had testified that the bank account was opened to receive a US$100mil from Saudi Arabia, which he was told was a contribution for Najib’s work in championing Islam

                Lawyer Alaistair Brandah Norman, who is part of Najib's defence team, informed High Court judge Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah that Muhammad Shafee has fever and severe throat infection, rendering him unable to address the court here on Thursday (Oct 6)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have to inform that Tan Sri (Muhammad Shafee) has taken ill this morning and was given a medical leave for four days, starting today until Oct 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was unable to attend the Court of Appeal matter this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “For 1MDB trial arrangement next week on Oct 11, we asked for a case management to be fixed at 2.30pm as Tan Sri has been instructed to attend another appeal case before Judicial Commissioner Azhar Abdul Hamid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He is required to submit on six grounds for a case that has been going on since 1999 and would not be able to come for the morning trial session,” Norman said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defence also requested for the 1MDB hearing scheduled on Oct 12 to start later in the day as Muhammad Shafee will be in another High Court before Justice Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The matter before Justice Ahmad Kamal is regarding Najib’s judicial review hearing to challenge the Prisons Department’s decision that rejected his request to attend Parliament sitting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Sequerah said these witnesses would be kept hanging if such delay continues and asked for the prosecution to arrange for a new witness to ensure there is a continuity in the trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This (1MDB) case has been delayed for so long

                We can’t be waiting for this court and that court, we also have a commitment to finish this trial

                Gareth Southgate will have to re-jig his defence if Walker is ruled out of the World Cup The 32-year-old has become a key player in Gareth Southgate's England squad over the years, earning 70 caps, the majority of which have come on the right side of a back three in recent times
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Walker does miss out, this would leave Southgate with an unwanted defensive conundrum to solve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A back three of Stones, Dier and Maguire (and don't forget Coady) Walker only just returned from injury in time to make England's squad for their Nations League clashes against Italy and Germany last month.  With this in mind, Southgate started him on the bench for the latter fixture and went with a back three of John Stones, Eric Dier and Harry Maguire
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Southgate may want to rely on John Stones and Harry Maguire, but they are currently injured Eric Dier is back in the England setup and could play alongside Stones and Maguire His absence would leave England with an alarming lack of pace at the back if they go with Stones, Dier and Maguire
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no guarantee that either man will get much game time between now and the World Cup, too, and playing them either side of Dier in a back three could be deemed a risk by Southgate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another option to slot into a back three would be the reliable Conor Coady
            </p>
            
            <p>
                James has played on the right side of a back three for Chelsea on a number of occasions over the last 18 months, and Southgate could be tempted to shift him inside from his wing-back position to add a little more pace centrally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Switch to a back four Walker has been a fundamental part of England's back three under Southgate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Surely there is no need for a back five against Iran, Wales and the United States?  It is a concern that Stones has largely operated as the central player in a back three for England, while James can play centrally but is currently thriving as a right-back at Stamford Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Southgate may be better off keeping James on the right flank, settling on a centre-back partner for Stones and reverting to a back four rather than asking these players to move away from their best roles just to keep the back three intact.

                In addition to the regular variants, the German carmaker also revealed updated AMG options for those who want more performance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latter is now a single bar of light at the top of each cluster instead of an L-shaped design on the previous car

            <p>
                Without the AMG package, the standard look features small faux side intakes at the corners of the bumper and the single slat running through a Mercedes-Benz logo sits atop a black grille insert
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The aggressive theme that you get with the AMG package applies to the rear bumper too, which has faux corner outlets and a diffuser element sandwiched between the chrome exhaust finishers – the standard look has a more reserved design
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While we are at the rear, both the hatchback and sedan retain the shape of their taillight clusters, although the lighting signature has been tweaked for the facelift

                As before, dual screens dominate the dashboard and they come in two configurations, with the base option consisting of a seven-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.25-inch central touchscreen, while the upgraded option includes dual 10.25-inch displays instead

                The Parking Package also now supports longitudinal parking and offers, among other things, a 360-degree camera with 3D images

                The space, in a four-storey River Valley shophouse, is about 60sq m in size, as big as a two-bedroom condo unit in the area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I considered buying a home, but it’s a big commitment for the long term and I wanted to explore living in different types of places,” said Guay, 29, who has been renting the space run by CP Residences since June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                CP Residences chief executive Wendy Yap said the tenant mix across its co-living apartments has changed from one that is being largely composed of foreigners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A shift in mindset in the local population towards renting compared with buying, and the time it takes for the young to attain home ownership due to increasing property prices, are some factors that have propelled the increase,” she said.Those aged 29 to 34 yearn to have their own space away from their family home, and more young couples turn to co-living spaces before buying a flat, Yap added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cove co-founder Luca Bregoli said some are “impatient to have their own space and freedom”, citing couples living at Cove co-living spaces while waiting for their Build-To-Order (BTO) flats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Co-living spaces offer a good option – for her, the draw was the three-month lease term offered by Figment, which manages the co-living space in a heritage shophouse in the city centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The S$3,900 (RM12,685)-a-month rent is “a lot of money that’s not going towards a mortgage”, she noted, but it is worth it

                The space, in a four-storey River Valley shophouse, is about 60sq m in size, as big as a two-bedroom condo unit in the area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I considered buying a home, but it’s a big commitment for the long term and I wanted to explore living in different types of places,” said Guay, 29, who has been renting the space run by CP Residences since June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                CP Residences chief executive Wendy Yap said the tenant mix across its co-living apartments has changed from one that is being largely composed of foreigners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A shift in mindset in the local population towards renting compared with buying, and the time it takes for the young to attain home ownership due to increasing property prices, are some factors that have propelled the increase,” she said.Those aged 29 to 34 yearn to have their own space away from their family home, and more young couples turn to co-living spaces before buying a flat, Yap added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cove co-founder Luca Bregoli said some are “impatient to have their own space and freedom”, citing couples living at Cove co-living spaces while waiting for their Build-To-Order (BTO) flats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Co-living spaces offer a good option – for her, the draw was the three-month lease term offered by Figment, which manages the co-living space in a heritage shophouse in the city centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The S$3,900 (RM12,685)-a-month rent is “a lot of money that’s not going towards a mortgage”, she noted, but it is worth it
            </p>

                McClatchy News is not naming the stepfather to protect the identity of the teen girl

            <p>
                The man has pleaded not guilty to sexual imposition and posted his bond of US$50,000 (RM231,550), according to WOIO

                One of the most common ways to create this income is to buy yourself an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Essentially, an annuity is an insurance contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will generally be a minimum payment that guarantees you don’t lose your principal, but it’s possible that the money won’t grow at all, which is not a concern with a fixed annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of this is determined when you buy your annuity contact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That percentage only ticks up to 95.9% if you use an annuity, not enough of a difference to justify using an annuity

                Social Security Bridge – Another Option Morningstar also details an alternative plan for making sure you have enough money in retirement without having to buy an annuity, a strategy known as the Social Security Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you turn 70, you file for Social Security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you start taking these payments, you can reduce the amount of money you take out of your retirement accounts each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Morningstar analysis, though, shows that if you have at least 36 times your needed annual income saved at the time of retirement, you likely don’t need to get an annuity

                A 529 plan can be a powerful way to save for college, offering tax-free growth and other tax benefits

            <p>
                In the past, there was a downside to a grandparent 529, though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here’s how the grandparent 529 loophole works
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor could help you put a financial plan together for your family’s education needs and goals

            <p>
                How Grandparent 529 Distributions Were Treated on FAFSA While distributions from grandparent 529s weren’t directly reported on the FAFSA in the past, they were counted as untaxed student income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So a large distribution from a grandparent 529 could detrimentally impact their grandchild’s need-based eligibility because of its treatment as student income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So let’s say a grandparent saved $35,000 in a 529 plan to cover one year of college for their grandchild
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That $35,000 distribution would be counted as student income, which would then be reported on the FAFSA, effectively reducing the student’s financial aid package by $17,500
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other Benefits of a Grandparent 529 Plan In addition to being a smart way for grandparents to help their grandkids save for college, grandparent 529 plans also have valuable tax and estate planning benefits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You’re allowed to change the beneficiary of a grandparent 529 plan as well, and this flexibility can be useful
            </p>

                Ten Hag believes it is part of the ups and downs he faces in trying to turn United around, and took the unusual step of thanking Guardiola for the brutal reality check
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag has thanked Pep Guardiola and Manchester City for hammering his United tea United were soundly beaten 6-3 on Sunday, ending a run of four straight Premier League wins ‘I know when you’re in a process it will not go only upside, you will have setbacks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We beat the No.1 in the league, we beat Liverpool, on Sunday we had a bad at the office and we got beaten,’ said Ten Hag

            <p>
                ‘It was a reality check, so we have to learn from it and carry on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘We will do that also in the future, but we can get a lot of confidence about this when you beat Arsenal and Liverpool, now we get a reality check with Man City
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Get back to the best results as we can, win games

                Erik ten Hag has thanked Pep Guardiola and Manchester City for hammering his United tea United were soundly beaten 6-3 on Sunday, ending a run of four straight Premier League wins ‘I know when you’re in a process it will not go only upside, you will have setbacks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We beat the No.1 in the league, we beat Liverpool, on Sunday we had a bad at the office and we got beaten,’ said Ten Hag

            <p>
                ‘It was a reality check, so we have to learn from it and carry on

            <p>
                ‘We will do that also in the future, but we can get a lot of confidence about this when you beat Arsenal and Liverpool, now we get a reality check with Man City

                Najib’s lawyer Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee confirmed to Malay Mail that his client’s application for judicial review was filed at the High Court in Kuala Lumpur this afternoon at around 1pm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Farhan confirmed that the scheduled Dewan Rakyat dates which Najib was seeking to attend are the dates from October 3 to November 29
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shahid is scheduled to hear Najib’s application for leave for judicial review on October 12
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In this lawsuit, Najib is seeking six main reliefs or court orders, including a certiorari order to quash or set aside the commissioner-general’s decision to not allow Najib access to his officers or aides for parliamentary, legislative and constituent work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The remaining three court orders sought by Najib are for a certiorari order to quash or set aside the commissioner-general’s decision to not allow him to attend Parliament on the scheduled dates of Parliament sittings; and a declaration that he is “entitled” to attend Parliament on such dates; and a mandamus order to compel the respondents to take the necessary steps to allow his attendance of Parliament on such dates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The full Dewan Rakyat schedule for the remaining meeting this year would be October 3 to 7, October 11 to 13, October 17 to 20, October 26 and 27, October 31 to November 3, November 7 to 10, November 14 to 17, November 21 to 24, and November 28 and 29

                Najib’s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah is currently scheduled to be heard on October 3 to 6, October 11 to 13, November 7 to 10, November 14 to 17, November 21 to 24, December 5 to 8, December 12 to 15, before continuing in January and February next year

            <p>
                Najib’s lead defence lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah had on Monday denied that the bid to have his client be allowed to attend Parliament is an attempt to delay the 1MDB trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib had on September 19 wrote to the Kajang Prison director-general to ask for access to his officers three times a week for parliament and constituent matters and to be allowed to attend Parliament under prison supervision to carry out his duties as MP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In conveying the government’s and commissioner-general’s decision, the Kajang prison had in a September 28 letter informed Najib that his application had been rejected on security or safety reasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Najib had filed an appeal to the home minister on September 30, the minister has yet to reply at the time the lawsuit was filed this afternoon.

            <p>
                This year, she finally built up her courage and signed up for the Miss Sabah Tourism pageant and won, thus bringing her to the national level pageant held in Ipoh, Perak in September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ong said in Sabah for example, she wishes to highlight its nature and friendly people, as well as the uniqueness of Sabahans who live peacefully regardless of race and religion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I want to tell the world and fellow Malaysians how beautiful Sabah is, how wonderful the people are and the importance of tolerance, mutual respect and love for harmony,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, she wants to also educate locals on the need to maintain their homestays or any tourist sites so that people will want to return for another visit

            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also urged women to find courage to try something new, something they are afraid of and just widen their experience and knowledge in various fields
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said they would be surprised at what they can accomplish, not to mention the wonderful experience gained, as well as the new friendships made throughout their journey by trying out something new.

                Valuation risks for the benchmark index “will persist well into 2023, and most downside in the coming months will come from slowing profitability,” which threatens to push the S&P 500 as low as 3,200 in the fourth quarter, according to Max Kettner, HSBC’s chief multi-asset strategist
            </p>

                That puts the firm’s year-end target below the average of 4,346 in the last Bloomberg survey conducted in mid-September

                On Monday, Credit Suisse strategists lowered their year-end goal for the S&P 500 by 10% to 3,850, citing the prospect of weakening corporate earnings growth next year

                Last month, Goldman slashed its 2022 target for the index to 3,600 from 4,300 on a higher-rate scenario
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite this year’s selloff, Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian said on Monday that there is “no full capitulation on Wall Street yet.” Last month, Subramanian reaffirmed the bank’s year-end target of 3,600

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement was accurate and with no exaggeration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee said the statement was made in response to queries by media members about the money that was deposited into Najib's accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At this juncture, senior Deputy Public Prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram responded, saying that his only complaint was that Muhammad Shafee could have raised the matter in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Does he (Muhammad Shafee) expect us to go to the media and say Tan Sri Shafee is wrong? "I’m perfectly happy if he makes the complaint before your Lordship

            <p>
                On Tuesday (Oct 4), Sri Ram warned Muhammad Shafee from conducting a trial in the media of the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was in response to a media statement by Muhammad Shafee on Monday (Oct 3) which highlighted the inflow of funds into Najib's account in February and June 2011 amounting to about RM60.6mil (about US$20mil) from Saudi royalty, Prince Faisal Turki Al Saud
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee also said the prosecution had only highlighted the two transfer transactions, but did not highlight five other transfers into Najib's account between Aug 2011 and Aug 2012 which were allegedly from Prince Turki and the Ministry of Finance Riyadh amounting to about US$180mil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee had also included letters from the former governor that were addressed to Najib, stating different sums of donations made to the former premier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The trial then proceeded with 39th prosecution witness, former AmBank non-executive director Cheah Tek Kuang, taking the witness stand to be cross-examined by Muhammad Shafee

                “Well, we didn’t talk much because I don’t know English and he [Klopp] doesn’t know Spanish,” he laughed

            <p>
                The PSSP was set up on Aug 2 to further scrutinise the proposed Tobacco and Smoking Control Bill (GEG) which was tabled by Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin in Dewan Rakyat on July 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, no vote was taken on the Bill during the second reading on Aug 2 with a motion passed instead to refer the matter to a bi-partisan PSSC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee also recommended that a clause is also included to make community service a punishment for offenders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PSSC also agreed with the Attorney General's Chambers that those penalised under the GEG will not be subject to a criminal record or a non-registrability of smoking offence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday (Oct 4), Khairy said that the GEG Bill will be tabled in Parliament on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Bill could be passed by Dewan Rakyat on Thursday (Oct 6) or after the Budget 2023 debate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he said it was uncertain if the Bill would be tabled in Dewan Negara if the Parliament is dissolved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He noted that like other Bills that do not make it to Dewan Negara if Parliament is dissolved, it has to be tabled again in Dewan Rakyat by the new government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dewan Rakyat's meeting is scheduled to end on Nov 29 while Dewan Negara will meet from Nov 21 to Dec 7.

                Wednesday, 05 Oct 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PSSP was set up on Aug 2 to further scrutinise the proposed Tobacco and Smoking Control Bill (GEG) which was tabled by Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin in Dewan Rakyat on July 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, no vote was taken on the Bill during the second reading on Aug 2 with a motion passed instead to refer the matter to a bi-partisan PSSC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee also recommended that a clause is also included to make community service a punishment for offenders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PSSC also agreed with the Attorney General's Chambers that those penalised under the GEG will not be subject to a criminal record or a non-registrability of smoking offence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday (Oct 4), Khairy said that the GEG Bill will be tabled in Parliament on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Bill could be passed by Dewan Rakyat on Thursday (Oct 6) or after the Budget 2023 debate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he said it was uncertain if the Bill would be tabled in Dewan Negara if the Parliament is dissolved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He noted that like other Bills that do not make it to Dewan Negara if Parliament is dissolved, it has to be tabled again in Dewan Rakyat by the new government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dewan Rakyat's meeting is scheduled to end on Nov 29 while Dewan Negara will meet from Nov 21 to Dec 7.

                “I must first of all profusely apologise to my learned friend if there was a misconstruction of the purpose of the media statement,” Shafee said in court, proffering an apology to lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram who warned the defence yesterday against conducting the 1MDB trial through the media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Sri Ram maintained that Shafee’s actions took the trial outside the courtroom when it should rightly be conducted inside before the judge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “My only point is he could have raised this before Your Lordship, because he has to fight in court, we cannot fight in the media

                I will be very grateful to my learned friend to refrain from doing this, if he has any complaint with how we conduct the case, he can place it before Your Lordship, I have no problem with it,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Shafee alleged “selective reporting” by certain media outlets covering the trial, purporting that the reporters focused on the prosecution's case and not the defence’s questions to witnesses during cross-examination
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Shafee conceded that it was only “fair” not to publicly comment on how the prosecution runs its case and limit his remarks to the media on how the defence does it when the judge pointed out that Sri Ram was saying that any comment on the way the prosecution is conducting the 1MDB case should be raised in the courtroom and not outside
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The judge said this was because the prosecution said it could not respond to Shafee's complaints if he made it outside of court

                Yesterday, Sri Ram told High Court that he objected strongly to Shafee’s press statement and said he will seek a court order against the defence lawyers if they continued to conduct the 1MDB trial through the media

            <p>

                Yesterday, Sri Ram told High Court that he objected strongly to Shafee’s press statement and said he will seek a court order against the defence lawyers if they continued to conduct the 1MDB trial through the media

                Cheah had yesterday related in court how he had gone to Najib’s house to open a new personal account with AmIslamic Bank during which the latter directly told him that US$100 million would be deposited into the new account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Cheah, Najib said the money was from Saudi Arabia and purported it was a donation for his “Islamic activity”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Cheah reiterated that Najib volunteered the information about the US$100 million “donation” from the Saudi Arabian government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his testimony yesterday, Cheah related that he had met privately with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) governor Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz to tell her about Najib’s new bank account and the latter’s expectation of US$100 million from Saudi Arabia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah agreed with Shafee today that it was a private bank account and that it was just a matter of courtesy for him to inform the BNM governor about it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Seri Najib must follow all the rules,” Cheah added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meeting Najib at his house for opening of account  Cheah said AmBank's then relationship manager Joanna Yu informed him in 2011 that “VVIP” client Najib wanted to open an account with the bank, and she felt it was not good protocol-wise for her to meet the then prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah said it was the first time he was dealing with Najib, adding that Azman asked him to attend to the matter of helping Najib open the bank account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah said Azlin sent a driver to pick him up from his house to go to Najib’s, confirming that they were the only two occupants in the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Chea affirmed that he saw Low Taek Jho – better known as Jho Low — at Najib’s house during that visit when asked by Shafee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He confirmed that he met Najib alone to set up the latter’s bank account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, who was in the courtroom also giggled at parts of Cheah's testimony

                Watching local team Arema FC play on Saturday was a special outing for soccer fan Andi's family, including his two-year-old son
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The overcrowded stadium in Malang in Indonesia's East Java province descended into chaos after police fired tear gas to disperse agitated fans who had poured on to the pitch at the end of the match
            </p>

            <p>
                Sputtering and stumbling through the tear gas, they managed to get to medics for help

            <p>
                Soccer's world governing body FIFA bans the use of "crowd control gas" at matches and an Indonesian police watchdog has said some officers wrongly used tear gas inside the stadium when there were no orders to do so

                Kuala Lumpur police chief Comm Datuk Azmi Abu Kassim said the 31-year-old victim was kidnapped at about 11pm on Sept 28
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A man emerged and dragged the victim into the vehicle before they drove away," he told reporters at the KL police headquarters on Wednesday (Oct 5)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His friend then lodged a police report at Dang Wangi police headquarters at 1am on Sept 29, he said

            <p>
                "We formed a task force of teams from the KL and Dang Wangi police headquarters to track down the victim," he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The task forces led by KL deputy CID chief Asst Comm Nasri Mansor managed to rescue the victim in Kuala Langat and arrested 12 Malaysian men and an Indonesian man late afternoon on Sept 29, Comm Azmi said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We are still tracking down the mastermind of the kidnapping, who is still at large," he said

                By Anirban Sen (Reuters) - Elon Musk's U-turn on buying Twitter Inc could not have come at a worse time for the banks funding a large portion of the $44 billion deal and they could be facing significant losses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As in any large acquisition, banks would look to sell the debt to get it off their books
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Musk will provide much of $44 billion by selling down his stake in electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc and by leaning on equity financing from large investors, major banks have committed to provide $12.5 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They include Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp and Barclays Plc

            <p>
                The Twitter debt package is comprised of $6.5 billion in leveraged loans, $3 billion in secured bonds, and another $3 billion in unsecured bonds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The banks have their backs to the wall - they have no choice but to finance the deal." Leveraged financing sources have also previously told Reuters that potential losses for Wall Street banks involved in the Twitter debt in such a market could run to hundreds of millions of dollars

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The increase comes days after the return of the F1 Grand Prix race that attracted more than 300,000 people at the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The race was not held in the last two years during the Covid-19 pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another likely reason for the spike is the large number of people now moving in and out of the country, not just for F1, added Professor Tambyah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The week-on-week infection ratio was at 1.56, and over the last 28 days, 68,891 people have tested positive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Leong said this trend is normal and each new variant will bring a spike in numbers before the situation settles again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said, so far, most people are reporting only a mild cough and sore throat and perhaps, a fever that will last for a few days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As long as the hospitalised or intensive care case numbers do not spike up significantly, it is acceptable,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MOH website on Tuesday said 286 people were in hospital, up from 257 the day before
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There were 11 people in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 28 on oxygen supplementation

                There is usually a spike in case numbers on Tuesdays, due to people socialising over the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The increase comes days after the return of the F1 Grand Prix race that attracted more than 300,000 people at the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The race was not held in the last two years during the Covid-19 pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another likely reason for the spike is the large number of people now moving in and out of the country, not just for F1, added Professor Tambyah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The week-on-week infection ratio was at 1.56, and over the last 28 days, 68,891 people have tested positive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Leong said this trend is normal and each new variant will bring a spike in numbers before the situation settles again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said, so far, most people are reporting only a mild cough and sore throat and perhaps, a fever that will last for a few days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As long as the hospitalised or intensive care case numbers do not spike up significantly, it is acceptable,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MOH website on Tuesday said 286 people were in hospital, up from 257 the day before
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There were 11 people in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 28 on oxygen supplementation

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company had filed the Order 89 application at the High Court in January last year to evict the monks by claiming that they were unlawful and unknown squatters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The monastery’s spokesman, Leong Cheok Keng, who is also Malim Nawar assemblyman, said the house of worship has been there for a century and should be preserved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Special flora and fauna species can only be found on the hill.” Geologists say there are many endangered species found in the five million-year-old limestone hills

                “We are happy with the verdict,” said Leong

                The plaintiff can still make an appeal or make a civil case, but we hope that they will leave the monastery alone.” The monastery’s legal team was led by Chan Kok Leong while the company was represented by Nimisha Jaya Gobi and Vong Sze Xin.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 5 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob's government will be tabling only his second federal Budget on October 7 but it could be the most significant one for his political career

            <p>
                With the 14th Parliamentary term set to expire by next July, Budget 2023 will be an “election Budget” — to be tabled by Finance Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz — regardless of when the 15th general election is held

                Still, the country’s ninth prime minister is expected to unveil a spending plan that will push his approval ratings up, which means it’s more than likely to be an expansionary Budget

                No political party can confidently predict how this demographic will cast their votes, or if they will even turn up, posing a challenge for Ismail Sabri and his party as they formulate next year’s spending plan

                The process was all done by the book, said AmBank’s non-independent and non-executive director Cheah Tek Kuang, who helped Najib open the current account

            <p>
                The process to open Najib’s account, Cheah said, was quite special due to his stature as the prime minister at the time

            <p>
                After the meeting with Najib, Cheah set up a meeting with Zeti to inform her about the opening of the 694 account and the incoming US$100mil from Saudi Arabia

            <p>
                A letter was also sent to Zeti to inform her of the code name, which would make it easier for the central bank to monitor the account

                Trent Alexander-Arnold has drawn praise for his performance against Rangers Rio Ferdinand said the fullback was like a 'magician' on the ball after the game "He's going to go down as one of the best right-backs we've ever seen in England."The highest of praise for Trent Alexander-Arnold from @rioferdy5..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This team has been built to get the best out of him in an attacking sense.' Alexander-Arnold did have one poor moment when he gave away a free kick just outside the Liverpool box
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If he can create a team where they can protect him defensively, then great.  'He’s going to go down as one of the best right back’s we’ve seen in England
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He wants to be the best
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ferdinand also said he would 'go down as one of the best right back’s we’ve seen in England' For Michael Owen, the fullback was aided by the performance of his captain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When he's got Henderson in the team, Alexander-Arnold is a different player

                Trent Alexander-Arnold has drawn praise for his performance against Rangers Rio Ferdinand said the fullback was like a 'magician' on the ball after the game "He's going to go down as one of the best right-backs we've ever seen in England."The highest of praise for Trent Alexander-Arnold from @rioferdy5..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This team has been built to get the best out of him in an attacking sense.' Alexander-Arnold did have one poor moment when he gave away a free kick just outside the Liverpool box
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If he can create a team where they can protect him defensively, then great.  'He’s going to go down as one of the best right back’s we’ve seen in England
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He wants to be the best
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ferdinand also said he would 'go down as one of the best right back’s we’ve seen in England' For Michael Owen, the fullback was aided by the performance of his captain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When he's got Henderson in the team, Alexander-Arnold is a different player

                Many Star Online readers were also irked by the situation, with one reader even highlighting that raw material in lifts do not touch the floor or the walls of the lift

            <p>
                For non-halal goods, please use the staircase.” The hotel, not wanting to evict its long-time Chinese restaurant tenant, was also obeying Jakim’s rules on the transport of non-halal food as part of its licensing requirements.

                These are among several improvements made by the Election Commission (EC) to allow the public more time to vote, said Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Parliament and Law) Datuk Seri Dr Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mukhriz had asked about the EC’s measures to ensure a high voter turnout rate and to guarantee the transparency of the voting process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During GE14 in 2018, the voter turnout was 82.32% and there were long queues at some polling centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Junaidi said the number of voting centres and channels would be increased this time, taking into account Undi18 – which lowered the voting age to 18 – and automatic voter registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is to avoid any congestion at the voting centres and channels,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The EC had said that there would be 9,560 polling centres for GE15, compared to 9,010 centres previously, while polling streams will increase from 29,054 to 38,990
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Junaidi added that a special lane for voters aged 60 and above and the disabled group (OKU) will also be set up and limited to 450 voters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The EC will also abolish the previous conditions for postal voting that were implemented in GE14, he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those who were living in southern Thailand (Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala, Songkhla and Satun), Singapore, Brunei or Kalimantan, did not qualify for postal voting and had to come back to vote

            <p>
                The Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Parliament and Law) said the Royal Assent for the Bill was received yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The law will be enforced against any MP who switches parties from this date onwards,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The law received assent from the King on Aug 31 and was gazetted on Sept 6, but without the date of enforcement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the enforcement of the anti-hopping law, Wan Junaidi said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob would now write to the state governments to adopt the law as part of their own state constitutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Sabah, Sarawak, Kelantan and Penang already have their own anti-hopping laws, Wan Junaidi said the Federal Government wanted the nation to have uniform laws against party hopping
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On another matter, Wan Junaidi said the Prime Minister had the sole discretion to determine Parliament’s dissolution, and as such was not bound to discuss it with anyone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Since Independence, the prime minister has not needed to discuss with the Cabinet the date for the dissolution of Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is at the Prime Minister’s discretion,” he told a press conference in Parliament’s media centre yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Ismail Sabri did raise the matter with the Cabinet two weeks ago, Wan Junaidi said that discussion centred on seeking an audience with the King to propose a date to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is up to the discretion of the Prime Minister, and at least the idea (of dissolution) was discussed with the Cabinet,” Wan Junaidi added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Ismail Sabri could also discuss the matter with selected leaders of his choosing, but reiterated that the King had the constitutional power to withhold consent to dissolve Parliament.

                The Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Parliament and Law) said the Royal Assent for the Bill was received yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The law will be enforced against any MP who switches parties from this date onwards,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The law received assent from the King on Aug 31 and was gazetted on Sept 6, but without the date of enforcement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the enforcement of the anti-hopping law, Wan Junaidi said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob would now write to the state governments to adopt the law as part of their own state constitutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Sabah, Sarawak, Kelantan and Penang already have their own anti-hopping laws, Wan Junaidi said the Federal Government wanted the nation to have uniform laws against party hopping
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On another matter, Wan Junaidi said the Prime Minister had the sole discretion to determine Parliament’s dissolution, and as such was not bound to discuss it with anyone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Since Independence, the prime minister has not needed to discuss with the Cabinet the date for the dissolution of Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is at the Prime Minister’s discretion,” he told a press conference in Parliament’s media centre yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Ismail Sabri did raise the matter with the Cabinet two weeks ago, Wan Junaidi said that discussion centred on seeking an audience with the King to propose a date to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is up to the discretion of the Prime Minister, and at least the idea (of dissolution) was discussed with the Cabinet,” Wan Junaidi added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Ismail Sabri could also discuss the matter with selected leaders of his choosing, but reiterated that the King had the constitutional power to withhold consent to dissolve Parliament.

                SERIE A table-toppers Napoli confirmed themselves as the dark horses in the Champions League with a barnstorming 6-1 win away at Ajax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Napoli kick-started their Champions League group stage off with a 4-1 win over last season's finalists Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And they smashed SIX past their final group opponents, Ajax, in their own back yard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it sparked life into Napoli, who proceeded to score three before half-time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The win keeps Napoli top of their group with Liverpool trailing just behind on six points, following a 2-0 home win over Rangers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hakan Calhanoglu netted the only goal of the game and with three games left in the group, Barca still need to play Bayern Munich again, who made light work of them last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bayern are running away with Group C
            </p>

                SERIE A table-toppers Napoli confirmed themselves as the dark horses in the Champions League with a barnstorming 6-1 win away at Ajax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Napoli kick-started their Champions League group stage off with a 4-1 win over last season's finalists Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And they smashed SIX past their final group opponents, Ajax, in their own back yard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it sparked life into Napoli, who proceeded to score three before half-time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The win keeps Napoli top of their group with Liverpool trailing just behind on six points, following a 2-0 home win over Rangers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hakan Calhanoglu netted the only goal of the game and with three games left in the group, Barca still need to play Bayern Munich again, who made light work of them last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bayern are running away with Group C

                Liverpool picked up a vital 2-0 win over Rangers in the Champions League on Tuesday, with Jurgen Klopp in positive spirits after the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool looked a more cohesive unit in the process, and speaking after the game, Klopp admitted he liked what he saw
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Good game, the game we wanted to play,” Klopp said

            <p>
                “It was a really good defensive performance in a new team structure and offensively we created an awful lot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I liked the game a lot.” The fact that Liverpool stayed in a 4-2-3-1 even when substitutes were made could suggest that they will again line up that way at Arsenal on Sunday

            <p>
                Trent Alexander-Arnold roared back to form on Tuesday night, curling home a wonderful free-kick and setting Liverpool on their way to victory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The right-back’s all-round game shone, both going forward and at the back, amid widespread criticism in recent weeks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He played a good game, especially defensively, and scored a wonderful goal,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Trent doesn’t have a defensive problem, we’ve had a defensive problem, because our timing wasn’t right and we take risks defending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It will happen – it’s all good.”    Liverpool’s form has been woeful by their extremely high standard and nobody will be more aware of that than the boss
            </p>

                We are not over the moon about our situation, but tonight I saw a team fully committed and that’s what we have to do.” The real litmus test for Liverpool will now come in the form of Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday, before a trip to Ibrox next week and then the visit of Man City

                Two dead balls, two goals, one from Trent Alexander-Arnold and another from Mo Salah, secured a needed win against Rangers, opening up a discussion over Liverpool’s formation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here, This Is Anfield’s Joanna Durkan (@JoannaDurkan_) is joined by fellow writer Sam Millne (@sam_millne) to discuss the win over Rangers, Alexander-Arnold and where next with this formation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For a player who has looked to lack confidence recently, the game will hopefully act as a springboard and influence Klopp’s thinking around his formation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His average position was in his own half with Tsimikas the one to take up a higher position on the flank, keeping Trent to Van Dijk and Matip but still slingshotting forward when the opportunity arose
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was more help at hand with how Liverpool setup and the balance Liverpool struck was just what was needed to restore confidence and bank a solid showing, as Sam also mentioned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On occasion, Nunez and Jota did get on top of each other in attacking positions but Klopp has said they have only had one session to work on the system and was impressed with how they have adapted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It doesn’t help also that Nunez has admitted he doesn’t understand the manager particularly well yet so he can only improve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The double pivot of Thiago and Henderson is perhaps where the system could fall against a team better than Rangers, who can beat Liverpool’s first line of pressure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The midfield has lacked in a 4-3-3 and it has left Liverpool vulnerable too many times, and the form the Gunners are in could make for plenty of chances to slice through the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I can see Klopp putting Firmino behind Jota in the same formation but I wouldn’t be opposed to keeping Nunez in the side and taking Jota out for Firmino – the good thing is that Liverpool have options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The system, whichever way Klopp goes, is nothing without the intensity and Liverpool have to bring that on Sunday – there’s a statement win waiting to be had

                Wednesday, 05 Oct 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kuala Lumpur goalkeeper Kevin Ray Mendoza, making his first start in the AFC Cup, was superb in goal, making six magnificent saves in regulation time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The game ended 0-0 after regulation and extra time at the Sogdiyana Stadium in Jizzakh, Uzbekistan, on Wednesday (Oct 5)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In normal time, Sogdiana was the side with the better chances and possession but could not find a way past Kuala Lumpur’s sturdy defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kuala Lumpur goalkeeper Kevin Ray Mendoza, making his first start in the AFC Cup, was superb in making six saves during that period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The game entered a penalty shootout to decide who gets to the final to face Omani club Al-Seeb on Oct 22 at the Cheras Football Stadium in Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kuala Lumpur captain Paulo Josue scored the first penalty to beat goalkeeper Shirinboy Abdullaev
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Midfielder Akram Mahinan scored the fourth penalty, and the winning penalty was taken by defender Giancarlo Gallifuoco
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Javokhir Qakhramanov got the ball rolling for Sogdiana by scoring the first penalty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mendoza continued his fine performance when he saved Sogdiana’s second penalty taken by Shakhboz Jurabekov
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Luka Cermelj scored the third for Sogdiana but it proved too little too late as Gallifuoco brought the City Boys to the final of the continental competition.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kuala Lumpur goalkeeper Kevin Ray Mendoza, making his first start in the AFC Cup, was superb in goal, making six magnificent saves in regulation time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The game ended 0-0 after regulation and extra time at the Sogdiyana Stadium in Jizzakh, Uzbekistan, on Wednesday (Oct 5)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In normal time, Sogdiana was the side with the better chances and possession but could not find a way past Kuala Lumpur’s sturdy defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kuala Lumpur goalkeeper Kevin Ray Mendoza, making his first start in the AFC Cup, was superb in making six saves during that period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The game entered a penalty shootout to decide who gets to the final to face Omani club Al-Seeb on Oct 22 at the Cheras Football Stadium in Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kuala Lumpur captain Paulo Josue scored the first penalty to beat goalkeeper Shirinboy Abdullaev
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Midfielder Akram Mahinan scored the fourth penalty, and the winning penalty was taken by defender Giancarlo Gallifuoco
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Javokhir Qakhramanov got the ball rolling for Sogdiana by scoring the first penalty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mendoza continued his fine performance when he saved Sogdiana’s second penalty taken by Shakhboz Jurabekov
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Luka Cermelj scored the third for Sogdiana but it proved too little too late as Gallifuoco brought the City Boys to the final of the continental competition.

            <p>
                This 10-seat version of the Staria is the true replacement for the Grand Starex, which can finally retire

                Three variants of the Staria 10-seater are available

                It’s black Nappa leather for the Max variant, which is the the only one here to get a powered driver seat (eight-way adjustment with four-way lumbar)

                Aren’t there 11 seats? Indeed, the Staria is marketed in some markets as an 11-seater, and that extra seat is in the front row, an extension of the front passenger seat

                "In sum, the CPTPP places Malaysia in a strategic position, elevating our competitiveness in the global arena
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As a bloc that advances regional economic integration, the CPTPP is also a testament to the significance of the multilateral trading system," it added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Miti, the CPTPP will broaden Malaysia's access to new markets such as Canada, Mexico and Peru, which are not covered by any existing Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The CPTTP will also elevate Malaysia's prominence as a global trading economy and boost total trade to US$655.9bil in 2030
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In addition, the findings of the CBA also indicate that Malaysia’s exports are projected to reach USD354.7bil in 2030, with trade balance remaining in strong surplus at 8.5% of GDP for the same year," said Miti
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the CPTPP, by January 1, 2033, almost 100% of Malaysian exports to all CPTTP countries will enjoy duty-free treatment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Miti, as soon as the CPTPP enters into force for Malaysia, all of the country's exports to Australia and Singapore will enter these markets without being subjected to any duties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Exports to New Zealand and Canada will be duty-free in 2024 and 2029 respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Miti said the CPTPP contains trade-facilitative Rules of Origin (ROO) that are designed to support modern business practices and further promote deeper integration of Malaysian businesses into regional supply chains
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The Agreement allows Malaysian manufacturers to source raw materials from all CPTPP countries for purposes of fulfilling the ROO requirements and consequently, qualifying for reduction and elimination of import duties," said Miti

            <p>
                It added that Malaysian companies will also have immediate access to the government procurement markets of other CPTPP countries at much lower thresholds, as compared to the high thresholds committed by Malaysia

                In a statement on Tuesday (Oct 4), the ministry said the article was inaccurate, misleading and gave a negative perception of the overall quality of roads in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also said the article used a report published by Zutobi, an online driver's education company as a reference, which calculated the scores based on only four factors – road quality; improvements in road quality; road deaths and the relative size of the road network, and it only took into account data for 59 countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ministry also explained that another report published by Utusan Malaysia on Aug 10 titled "Kualiti Jalan di Malaysia 21 Terbaik di Dunia, Mengatasi Australia, Britain, New Zealand" (Road quality in Malaysia among 21 best in the world, surpassing Australia, Britain, New Zealand), based on the road quality rankings issued by The Global Economy using the data obtained from the Global Competitiveness Index
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the news report, Malaysia scored 5.3 points out of the total seven points to be in the 21st position, surpassing Sweden (23), Canada (31), Australia (33) and Britain (37)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia is also ranked second in Southeast Asia, after Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There are various ongoing commitments carried out by the ministry, specifically in maintaining the quality of roads in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The ministry also received over RM900,000 in allocations for road maintenance costs throughout the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ministry said it also focused on continuous efforts to maintain road quality through the Zeropotholes campaign since 2016 and the Kita Jaga Jalan Kita Campaign launched in November 2021

            <p>
                The ministry also explained that another report published by Utusan Malaysia on Aug 10 titled "Kualiti Jalan di Malaysia 21 Terbaik di Dunia, Mengatasi Australia, Britain, New Zealand" (Road quality in Malaysia among 21 best in the world, surpassing Australia, Britain, New Zealand), based on the road quality rankings issued by The Global Economy using the data obtained from the Global Competitiveness Index
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the news report, Malaysia scored 5.3 points out of the total seven points to be in the 21st position, surpassing Sweden (23), Canada (31), Australia (33) and Britain (37)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia is also ranked second in Southeast Asia, after Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There are various ongoing commitments carried out by the ministry, specifically in maintaining the quality of roads in the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The ministry also received over RM900,000 in allocations for road maintenance costs throughout the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ministry said it also focused on continuous efforts to maintain road quality through the Zeropotholes campaign since 2016 and the Kita Jaga Jalan Kita Campaign launched in November 2021

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah was explaining how he facilitated the opening of Najib’s current account 211-202-200969-4 on Jan 13, 2011 (known as the “9694” account)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The purpose of the meeting was to inform her that Najib had opened an account and there were incoming funds of US$100 million from Saudi Arabia,” he said

            <p>
                The former MD added that the “AmPrivate Banking-MR” code name was used for Najib’s current account and it was managed by AmBank customer relationship manager Joanna Yu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The name was assigned to the account “to avoid private information from being misused”

            <p>
                Cheah said he wasn’t sure if Najib was informed of the code name, but that it fell within the purview of the bank’s operation to choose the code name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, Cheah said he had first gone to Najib’s house in Jalan Langgak Duta, Kuala Lumpur in 2011 to facilitate the opening of the bank account, after being given the green light by AmBank chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim

                Cheah said he didn’t ask Najib what the purpose of the funds were coming in for, but that Najib voluntarily said it was a donation to him from Saudi Arabia, in line with some “Islamic activity”

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 4 — Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said that his party’s alliance with PAS can continue for the next general election (GE15) on the condition that the latter cuts its political ties with Perikatan Nasional (PN)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking after the party’s meeting with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob and other top leaders, Ahmad Zahid said that PAS can even use its own logo when campaigning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if Umno had set a deadline for PAS, Ahmad Zahid only stated it should happen sooner rather than later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his insistence on going solo for GE15, he said that it does not mean Umno is brimming with confidence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But if PAS wants to be with Umno and Barisan Nasional (BN), they are free to use their party symbols
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 4 — Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said that his party’s alliance with PAS can continue for the next general election (GE15) on the condition that the latter cuts its political ties with Perikatan Nasional (PN)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking after the party’s meeting with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob and other top leaders, Ahmad Zahid said that PAS can even use its own logo when campaigning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if Umno had set a deadline for PAS, Ahmad Zahid only stated it should happen sooner rather than later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his insistence on going solo for GE15, he said that it does not mean Umno is brimming with confidence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But if PAS wants to be with Umno and Barisan Nasional (BN), they are free to use their party symbols

                It also said that the appointment of KPISoft Malaysia Sdn Bhd to develop the MySejahtera application did not follow procedures set by Putrajaya, and moving forward, the government needs to take a more prudent approach in all procurement processes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wong said while the government had guaranteed that it owned the app, and its data would not be abused, KPISoft was the owner of MySejahtera’s intellectual property
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Cabinet’s decision to procure the app from the app developer goes to show that the app is, in principle, still owned by the developer,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee found that the appointment of KPISoft Sdn Bhd as the MySejahtera application developer in March 2020 was not organised and not in line with the public procurement procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                KPISoft Sdn Bhd, the developer of the MySejahtera application, allowed the government one year to use the app for free and then started to charge the government from April 2021 onward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report said the government was not clear in terms of KPISoft’s appointment, the concept of CSR, and the ownership of MySejahtera
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PAC also found no document showing the one-year time frame set by KPISoft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The development and continuous use of the App should have continued to be a CSR effort
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of April this year, the government had yet to register the intellectual property for the MySejahtera application on MyIPO, which may cause the application to be claimed for ownership by the developer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PAC recommended that the government ensure full ownership of the MySejahtera application, besides the need to guarantee the security of users' personal data in the application and ensure that the data is not misused by any party
            </p>

                Lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram today told the High Court of his strong objection to Najib's lead defence lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah's act of issuing a media statement regarding evidence in the ongoing 1MDB trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reading out parts of Shafee's press statement issued on Najib's behalf which claimed that the prosecution had failed to disclose details of five transactions of hundreds of millions that entered Najib's account, Sri Ram said the statement was a "direct attack" on the prosecution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram said this was unfair as the prosecution — which conducts the 1MDB trial in court instead of through the media — could not be making a response in public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With respect, the accused must conduct his trial in court, he cannot be conducting it in public,” he said, referring to Najib as the accused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And we are put in an invidious position, because we cannot respond, I cannot respond in public and it is not proper for me to respond in public,” he pointed out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the three letters purportedly by an alleged Saudi prince Saud Abdulaziz Al-Saud which Najib's lawyers had been showing the High Court in the 1MDB trial of purported promises of hundreds of millions of US dollars as a “gift” to Najib, Sri Ram said these same letters had been rejected by all three tiers of the court in the SRC case against Najib
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is fairness to us, but they cannot say suppressed to us
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee was not present when Sri Ram made his objection, as he was said to be unwell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed informed the High Court that he was not in a position to respond to the objection, and that Shafee will be replying the first thing tomorrow morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram then said he was not inviting judge Collin to make any finding, but that he was merely saying that the prosecution was being put in an "invidious" position by Najib's lawyers as the prosecution was wrongly portrayed to be suppressing evidence
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram today told the High Court of his strong objection to Najib's lead defence lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah's act of issuing a media statement regarding evidence in the ongoing 1MDB trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reading out parts of Shafee's press statement issued on Najib's behalf which claimed that the prosecution had failed to disclose details of five transactions of hundreds of millions that entered Najib's account, Sri Ram said the statement was a "direct attack" on the prosecution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram said this was unfair as the prosecution — which conducts the 1MDB trial in court instead of through the media — could not be making a response in public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With respect, the accused must conduct his trial in court, he cannot be conducting it in public,” he said, referring to Najib as the accused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And we are put in an invidious position, because we cannot respond, I cannot respond in public and it is not proper for me to respond in public,” he pointed out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the three letters purportedly by an alleged Saudi prince Saud Abdulaziz Al-Saud which Najib's lawyers had been showing the High Court in the 1MDB trial of purported promises of hundreds of millions of US dollars as a “gift” to Najib, Sri Ram said these same letters had been rejected by all three tiers of the court in the SRC case against Najib
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is fairness to us, but they cannot say suppressed to us
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee was not present when Sri Ram made his objection, as he was said to be unwell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed informed the High Court that he was not in a position to respond to the objection, and that Shafee will be replying the first thing tomorrow morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram then said he was not inviting judge Collin to make any finding, but that he was merely saying that the prosecution was being put in an "invidious" position by Najib's lawyers as the prosecution was wrongly portrayed to be suppressing evidence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's 1MDB trial resumes this afternoon

                Saravanan slammed the former human resources minister during the Pakatan Harapan administration for imposing a moratorium on the recruitment of workers from Bangladesh on Sept 1, 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "From Sept 1, 2018 to the change of government, we have been lacking foreign workers," said Saravanan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Once the government changed, we took over, but Covid-19 pandemic hit the country and due to this, we could not take any foreign workers for about three years," he said in his reply to M

            <p>
                Saravanan added that he managed to finalise the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Bangladesh and Indonesia during his tenure, saying that both countries are the largest sources of foreign workers for Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kulasegaran had asked the Human Resources Ministry to explain the initiatives taken to address the shortage of foreign workers in various critical sectors including the plantation sector, which had delayed the country's economic recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The number of foreign workers that are currently working in our country at the moment is about 1.24 million in various sectors," said Saravanan in his reply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So within the next one or two months, we expect to see an estimated 2.1 million foreign workers coming into the country," said Saravanan

                He added that the ministry will review any future application carefully and in an orderly manner to ensure that Malaysia will not end up being a 'dumping ground' for foreign workers.

                It said in a report tabled in Parliament on Oct 4 that this included the appointment of KPISoft (Entomo) as the app’s developer as this was not done according to government procurement procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee found that the government lacked clarity on the direction of the procurement of the app due to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) concept proposed by KPISoft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The government was confused in terms of the appointment of KPISoft, the CSR concept and the ownership period of the MySejahtera app,” it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This amount is high and goes against the concept of CSR,” said the committee in the report

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee also said that as of April, the government has yet to register the intellectual property (IP) for MySejahtera on MyIPO, which means the developer could still lay a claim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The government had stressed that it is the owner of the MySejahtera app, but the developer KPISoft (Entomo) was found to have claimed that it was the owner of the IP for the MySejahtera app,” the report said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It further added that Cabinet’s decision to have the government take over the application from the developer shows that the application is still owned by the developer

                Leicester City's James Maddison scored two first-half goals as they beat promoted Nottingham Forest 4-0 on Monday to move off the bottom of the table with their first Premier League win of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pressure, for now, is off Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers, who looked and sounded like someone who could no longer get the best out of his squad following a 6-2 loss at Tottenham Hotspur before the international break
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "And to get the performance we did, hopefully we can push on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I felt we had a horrendous summer -- that is the reality -- and it continued into the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We just didn't play to the levels, but we've been able to reset that." The Foxes, who had taken one point from their first seven games and were the only winless side in the top flight, moved ahead of Forest on goal difference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maddison broke the ice with the first in the 25th minute, his shot from just outside the box deflected in off the arm of Forest defender Scott McKenna, and Harvey Barnes doubled the lead two minutes later with a stellar shot from distance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a stellar all-round display from Maddison, who was disappointed to be overlooked in the latest England squad despite having strong form for much of 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defeat was a fifth in a row for Forest, piling pressure on manager Steve Cooper as he tries to gel a team packed with new signings, and Leicester's first clean sheet in the league this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I'm doing my job
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Brendan Rodgers called it "a shame I think for the country and for the boy himself" that James Maddison hasn't really been part of England's roster.

                Leicester City's James Maddison scored two first-half goals as they beat promoted Nottingham Forest 4-0 on Monday to move off the bottom of the table with their first Premier League win of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pressure, for now, is off Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers, who looked and sounded like someone who could no longer get the best out of his squad following a 6-2 loss at Tottenham Hotspur before the international break
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "And to get the performance we did, hopefully we can push on
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I felt we had a horrendous summer -- that is the reality -- and it continued into the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We just didn't play to the levels, but we've been able to reset that." The Foxes, who had taken one point from their first seven games and were the only winless side in the top flight, moved ahead of Forest on goal difference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maddison broke the ice with the first in the 25th minute, his shot from just outside the box deflected in off the arm of Forest defender Scott McKenna, and Harvey Barnes doubled the lead two minutes later with a stellar shot from distance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a stellar all-round display from Maddison, who was disappointed to be overlooked in the latest England squad despite having strong form for much of 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defeat was a fifth in a row for Forest, piling pressure on manager Steve Cooper as he tries to gel a team packed with new signings, and Leicester's first clean sheet in the league this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I'm doing my job
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Min odds, bet and payment method exclusions apply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Brendan Rodgers called it "a shame I think for the country and for the boy himself" that James Maddison hasn't really been part of England's roster.

                Ronaldo, 37, was an unused substitute for the 6-3 defeat at Manchester City and has not started a Premier League game since the 4-0 defeat to Brentford in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                UEFA rules would allow Ronaldo to sign for a team in the Champions League in January and play in the knockout rounds in the new year despite having made two appearances for United in the Europa League this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that Ten Hag is understanding of Ronaldo's situation but would still be reluctant to let him leave in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Rashford and Martial have already missed games through injury this season, and Ten Hag is wary of leaving himself short of options during a congested season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo has a contract at Old Trafford until the end of the season, plus an option to extend until the summer of 2024.

                Ronaldo, 37, was an unused substitute for the 6-3 defeat at Manchester City and has not started a Premier League game since the 4-0 defeat to Brentford in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                UEFA rules would allow Ronaldo to sign for a team in the Champions League in January and play in the knockout rounds in the new year despite having made two appearances for United in the Europa League this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that Ten Hag is understanding of Ronaldo's situation but would still be reluctant to let him leave in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Rashford and Martial have already missed games through injury this season, and Ten Hag is wary of leaving himself short of options during a congested season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo has a contract at Old Trafford until the end of the season, plus an option to extend until the summer of 2024.

            <p>
                On Sunday, Azmin took a swipe at his now arch nemesis and Opposition leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, saying that he is ready to contest the latter for the Gombak parliamentary seat

            <p>
                At the PKR branch election machinery launch today, some 250 to 300 people showed up to listen to speeches from various party leaders including Anwar, despite the moderate downpour of rain

                While Suarez's 59 goals in his first 100 European games is very impressive, it's still nowhere near a match for Haaland

                ERLING HAALAND has averaged BETTER than a goal every game in his first 100 appearances in Europe's major leagues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Haaland has netted a bonkers 103 goals in 100 league games across his time with Borussia Dortmund and City
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's more than double Mbappe's 48 strikes in his first 100 Ligue 1 games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While two of the all-time greats in Messi and Ronaldo are even further behind
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Messi netted 41 times in his first 100 La Liga games for Barcelona, while Ronaldo could only muster a measly 16 strikes in his first century of games in Europe's major leagues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Suarez's 59 goals in his first 100 European games is very impressive, it's still nowhere near a match for Haaland

                HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBALL The striker is on track to beat the Prem's goal scoring record for a single season by JANURAY

            <p>
                Haaland's record is so mind blowing, Liverpool legend Carragher reckons the City man is talk of training grounds up and down the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kop icon claimed Haaland is already "mentally" impacting Prem defenders off the pitch

                Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens praise Gonzalo Higuain, but ask if his career could have been even better after the striker announced his retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Higuain, 34, will play out the rest of the season with Miami, which is currently in the playoff positions in Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference with two games left to play
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But despite regaining his form for the Herons, a tearful Higuain told a press conference on Monday morning that he was calling time on his career at the end of the 2022 MLS campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                the time has come to say goodbye." Higuain began his professional career with Argentine giants River Plate in 2005 after progressing through the club's youth system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Higuain departed after seven seasons in Madrid, moving to Napoli in the summer of 2013 for $53.1m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the summer of 2016, Juventus activated a release clause in Higuain's contract, allowing them to acquire the Argentine for just under $100m, a Serie A record at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After an impressive initial season that saw him score 32 goals, Higuain's production soon dropped off, leading the Bianconeri to loan him out to be both AC Milan and Chelsea during the 2018-19 campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After one final season with Juventus in 2019-20, in which he helped the club to a third Serie A title during his tenure there, Higuain moved to Inter Miami, where he has scored 27 goals and added 14 assists in 65 league appearances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "My biggest motivation is helping my teammates," Higuain said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was part of the Juventus side that lost the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League final, 4-1 to Real Madrid, as well as the Argentina side that fell to Germany in the 2014 World Cup final, a match that saw Higuain spurn several chances, including a one-on-one with Germany keeper Manuel Neuer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Higuain will still go down as one of the better forwards of his generation, having scored over 300 goals at club level

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 4 — Lawyer Datuk Zaid Ibrahim has called for a suspension of all high-profile criminal court cases involving politicians until a new attorney general is appointed replacing incumbent Tan Sri Idrus Harun
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Pending the appointment of a new AG, which is bound to take place after the coming general election, all high-profile cases ought to be suspended,” Zaid was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zaid said there were concerns of selective prosecution in those cases and cited excerpts from a recent book authored by former AG Tan Sri Tommy Thomas — who is now under investigation for sedition among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also blamed Idrus for creating a “negative perception” of the justice system after dropping the bribery and money laundering charges against Baling MP Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim without explanation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This clearly shows the deplorable state of affairs in our justice system

                Zaid, who was briefly disgraced ex-prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s defence lawyer in the latter’s last SRC International Sdn Bhd appeal at the Federal Court, listed the ongoing court cases against Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Umno Johor chief Tan Sri Shahrir Samad, as well as DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng, and Muda president Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He faulted Idrus for doing nothing to inspire confidence, especially after Najib’s conviction for SRC International
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also claimed “everyone knows” that the trial judge in Najib’s SRC International case should have recused himself due to “serious conflict of interests” and that the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) had issued a report to confirm this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zaid claimed that Najib was “wrongly convicted” as a result of the combination of Thomas’ alleged “indiscretions” and Idrus’ “inaction”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was granted a one-year extension till March 2023 when his two-year contract expired this year.

                Warren Buffett is widely considered to be one of the most successful investors of all time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Berkshire trades at about $400,000 and Buffett has a net worth of $97 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This strategy involves selling an option where you promise to buy a stock at a specific strike price below its current value sometime in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This immediately gives you money from the sale of the option
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the share price doesn’t fall, you keep the money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the price does fall below the strike price, you purchase the stock at a price that’s less than you would have paid at the time you sold the option, with the cash from the option sale further reducing your cost basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is a good strategy on a stock that you wouldn't mind owning in the first place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The option is considered “naked” because you haven’t secured another option to buy the stock, such as shorting shares of that same stock to offset your purchase cost
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But just because those little outfits are off-limits to Buffett today doesn’t mean you can’t go after them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Buffett’s “buy and hold” approach doesn’t extend to never admitting that even he sometimes gets it wrong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for Buffett, his big misstep recently was investing in airline companies

                Leicester City's James Maddison scored two first-half goals as they beat promoted Nottingham Forest 4-0 on Monday to move off the bottom of the table with their first Premier League win of the season

                Johor police chief Comm Datuk Kamarul Zaman Mamat said police were notified about the incident at Jalan Ria 2 after the victim’s father lodged a report between 10pm and 11pm on Sunday (Oct 2) night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that police arrested the 28-year-old salesman, who had priors, and a 40-year-old Indonesian maid on Monday (Oct 3) afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The victim and his younger sibling, who is one year old, has been under the suspect’s care, three months ago,” he said in a press conference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Comm Kamarul Zaman added that only the victim was abused as the body showed bruise marks and small wounds, while the younger sibling did not suffer any injuries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the body has been sent to Sultanah Aminah Hospital for a post mortem, while the police would bring the two suspects to the Johor Baru magistrate’s court for a remand application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Comm Kamarul Zaman added the police would investigate the case under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder

                On Friday, Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Koerner reassured staff that the bank has a “strong capital base and liquidity position” and told employees that he will be sending them a regular update until the firm announces a new strategic plan on Oct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Koerner, who was named CEO in late July, has had to deal with market speculation, banker exits and capital doubts as he seeks to set a path forward for the troubled Swiss bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Credit Suisse’s market capitalization dropped to around 10 billion Swiss francs, meaning any share sale would be highly dilutive to longtime holders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The market value was above 30 billion francs as recently as March 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Credit Suisse executives have noted that the firm’s 13.5% CET1 capital ratio at June 30 was in the middle of the planned range of 13% to 14% for 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The five-year credit default swaps price of about 250 basis points is up from about 55 basis points at the start of the year and is near their highest on record
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deutsche Bank saw its credit-default swaps climb, its debt rating downgraded and some clients step back from working with it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Credit Suisse doesn’t face any one issue on the scale of Deutsche Bank’s $7.2 billion settlement, and its key capital ratio of 13.5% is higher than the 10.8% that the German firm had six years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stress Deutsche Bank faced in 2016 resulted in the unusual dynamic where the cost of insuring against losses on the lender’s debt for one year surpassed that of protection for five years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Credit Suisse’s one-year swaps are still significantly cheaper than five-year ones
            </p>
            
            <p>
                16 Last week, Credit Suisse said it’s working on possible asset and business sales as part of its strategic plan which will be unveiled at the end of October

                Monday, 03 Oct 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Truss, and her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, announced a new "growth plan" on Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                23 that would cut taxes and regulation, funded by vast government borrowing to snap the economy out of years of stagnant growth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the plan triggered a crisis of investor confidence in the government, hammering the value of the pound and government bond prices and jolting global markets to such an extent that the Bank of England had to intervene with a 65 billion pound ($73 billion) programme to shore up the markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the removal of the top rate of tax only made up around 2 billion out of a 45 billion pound tax-cutting plan, it was the most eye-catching element of a fiscal package that was to be funded by government borrowing, with Kwarteng not explaining how it would be paid for in the long-term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision to reverse course is likely to put Truss and Kwarteng under huge pressure, less than four weeks after they came to power
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kwarteng said he had not considered resigning

                Monday, 03 Oct 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Truss, and her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, announced a new "growth plan" on Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                23 that would cut taxes and regulation, funded by vast government borrowing to snap the economy out of years of stagnant growth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the plan triggered a crisis of investor confidence in the government, hammering the value of the pound and government bond prices and jolting global markets to such an extent that the Bank of England had to intervene with a 65 billion pound ($73 billion) programme to shore up the markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the removal of the top rate of tax only made up around 2 billion out of a 45 billion pound tax-cutting plan, it was the most eye-catching element of a fiscal package that was to be funded by government borrowing, with Kwarteng not explaining how it would be paid for in the long-term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision to reverse course is likely to put Truss and Kwarteng under huge pressure, less than four weeks after they came to power
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kwarteng said he had not considered resigning

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 3 — The reason many areas that supposedly should have 5G internet connection still haven't is because the telecommunication companies are not playing ball with the government, Deputy Minister of Communications and Multimedia Datuk Zahidi Zainul Abidin said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "First and foremost, please inform the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) if your area has poor internet access
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We at the MCMC give the money to build these transmission stations using government and taxpayers money but the telcos are in charge of fastening the transmitters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We at MCMC can only ask them or implore them to place these transmitters to increase the strength of the transmitters while DNB don't have the authority to force them or reprimand them for not doing so
            </p>
            
            <p>

                He said boosting internet signals to rural areas will cost a lot of money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However this costs money

            <p>
                We can take money from the SB (statutory bodies) fund or state government money as they have their own multimedia agencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The contention over 5G rollout in the country began when the government decided to create DNB, a special purpose vehicle to roll out the network in the country under a single wholesale network model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After much objection from the telcos who proposed a dual wholesale network to counter the single wholesale network, the government decided to offer a 70 per cent stake in DNB to the players while keeping 30 per cent and holding a golden share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal to take up a stake in DNB also requires shareholders to be 5G access seekers — they must also buy 5G capacity from DNB — with Tengku Zafrul also saying that foreign players were "knocking on our doors" to participate.

                The MACC chief commissioner said the number of corruption cases with women as the perpetrators was on the rise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When I first joined the organisation, which was then known as BPR (Badan Pencegah Rasuah), there was hardly a woman arrested for corruption in a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Corruption is about people who have power, the people who are given the trust and responsibility, ” he said in an interview here recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MACC was established on Oct 1, 1967
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was formerly known as the Anti-Corruption Agency (BPR) before becoming an independent commission in 2009

            <p>
                When asked about political funding, Azam said there was a need to formulate a law on it to expedite the requirements for politicians and political parties to declare the funds they received
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether political funding was lawful or not depends on the definition in the law, which may differ from one country to another, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Malaysia, he said, there was no law yet governing funds received by politicians and political parties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, it is not a crime for politicians and political parties to accept political funding and donations, he said, adding that they could accept political donations from corporations or individuals, provided the money is not from unlawful sources
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam said the commission received many complaints about political entities receiving funds in the form of bribes

                KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 -- Members of Parliament voted for the Constitution (Amendment) Bill (No
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among others, the MOU outlined an anti-party hopping law and that Parliament was not to be dissolved before that date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A prior constitutional amendment in July 2019 which was also unanimously passed in Parliament saw the lowering of the minimum voting age to 18 from 21, as well as allowing for automatic voter registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The law, which has been gazetted and in force since Dec 15 last year, will allow 21.2million Malaysians to vote in GE15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A total of 29 new bills have been passed by the House, which included the long-awaited Anti-Sexual Harassment Bill, which will allow victims of sexual harassment (verbal, non-verbal, visual, gestural or physical) to report the harassment and have their case heard in a closed-door tribunal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s ahead Friday’s tabling of Budget 2023 will be a key focus of Parliament, along with the tabling of the Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022, which seeks to prohibit those born on and after Jan 1, 2007, from purchasing or possessing cigarettes or vape products
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said he was confident that the Bill, which is still being reviewed and studied by a Parliamentary Select Committee, will receive the support of the majority of MPs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 2, the Dewan Rakyat agreed that the Tobacco Product and Smoking Control Bill 2022 be referred to a Parliamentary Select Committee to examine and make recommendations for improvement, when the Bill was in its second reading
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bill was deemed by some MPs to be limiting freedom of choice after it was tabled in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bill is among eight bills that have been tabled for its first reading in Parliament this year

                KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 -- Members of Parliament voted for the Constitution (Amendment) Bill (No
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among others, the MOU outlined an anti-party hopping law and that Parliament was not to be dissolved before that date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A prior constitutional amendment in July 2019 which was also unanimously passed in Parliament saw the lowering of the minimum voting age to 18 from 21, as well as allowing for automatic voter registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The law, which has been gazetted and in force since Dec 15 last year, will allow 21.2million Malaysians to vote in GE15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A total of 29 new bills have been passed by the House, which included the long-awaited Anti-Sexual Harassment Bill, which will allow victims of sexual harassment (verbal, non-verbal, visual, gestural or physical) to report the harassment and have their case heard in a closed-door tribunal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s ahead Friday’s tabling of Budget 2023 will be a key focus of Parliament, along with the tabling of the Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022, which seeks to prohibit those born on and after Jan 1, 2007, from purchasing or possessing cigarettes or vape products
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said he was confident that the Bill, which is still being reviewed and studied by a Parliamentary Select Committee, will receive the support of the majority of MPs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 2, the Dewan Rakyat agreed that the Tobacco Product and Smoking Control Bill 2022 be referred to a Parliamentary Select Committee to examine and make recommendations for improvement, when the Bill was in its second reading
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bill was deemed by some MPs to be limiting freedom of choice after it was tabled in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bill is among eight bills that have been tabled for its first reading in Parliament this year

                Malaysians, say political observers, are looking forward to seeing what is in store for them and what the coalition government under Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob has got to offer in Budget 2023

                Rather than having two full-backs in the three, Alexander-Arnold would position himself alongside Fabinho and Thiago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sustained use of a 2-3-5 might, then, be a natural evolution for this Klopp side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But there are reasons to believe this might work for Liverpool, given Alexander-Arnold’s skillset and their current defensive frailties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if Liverpool continue to persist with their current set-up, then it’s hard to envisage a significant uplift in results.

                In Naples, Koulibaly was known for his explosive physical strength but it was used in conjunction with strong tactical intelligence.  Kim Min-jae has been a huge success since joining Napoli in the summer from Fenerbahce By contrast, Kim seems to prefer direct aggression - and it's working too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Koulibaly is certainly among the strongest defenders in the world and will be remembered as a Napoli icon but Kim looks set to be even more useful to the Italian side.  Kim uses all the dark arts a defender can use during a game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His aggressive form of defending has already rattled Premier League sides including Liverpool Kim's physical strength has been key in helping Napoli lead Serie A in the early stages this term Standing at 190cm and about 88kg, moving Kim is like trying to shift Mount Vesuvius
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his giant physique and aggressive nature, Kim appears to stick to the rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim is inspired by Sergio Ramos and Fabio Cannavaro but soon dreams of inheriting the leadership of Koulibaly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim though has not allowed such a move to hinder his game - he appears to now thrive on the pressure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim is focused precisely on his career and his move from Fenerbahce underlines his desire to become an elite player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rival clubs could soon be showing interest in Kim though as in his 40-page contract there is a €50m (£44m) release clause
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Considering his physical attributes, Kim would be the ideal player in any top international club but would probably be perfectly at home in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United have shown interest in Kim, who has been compared to club captain Harry Maguire in terms of his strength but of having greater concentration Kim signed a contract of three years plus another 24 months on top as an option to Napoli
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim has the physique of Harry Maguire but compared to the English defender he has exceptional concentration which makes him difficult to overcome

                The remote control aspect is via Bluetooth control, which enable users to control the scale models through their mobile devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What will these cost? To purchase these scale models individually, customers will need to purchase a minimum of RM50 in Shell fuels, in order to be eligible to purchase the models at RM30 each
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These however do not include the smart battery which is sold separately at RM30, which enables Bluetooth remote control of the models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the purchase of a four-litre pack of Shell Helix engine oil, customers will receive the exclusive Ferrari SF90 F1 scale model for free, along with the Bluetooth smart battery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, purchasing a minimum of RM80 worth of Shell V-Power Racing petrol (at participating stations) will make the buyer eligible to purchase the exclusive collector’s box for RM80

            <p>
                In conjunction with the launch of this Shell Motorsport Collection, Shell Malaysia will be holding events at KL Sentral from October 17 to 23, as well as at the Mid Valley Megamall from October 26 to 30, and these venues will be where the public will get to try out all seven remote control scale models on a specially designed course

                These however do not include the smart battery which is sold separately at RM30, which enables Bluetooth remote control of the models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the purchase of a four-litre pack of Shell Helix engine oil, customers will receive the exclusive Ferrari SF90 F1 scale model for free, along with the Bluetooth smart battery

                Jin Wei, who had to play in three games in her previous two rounds, was served a blow by Vietnam’s Nguyen Thuy Linh with a 21-15, 21-13 win in 32 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was the 22-year-old’s first defeat to the world No
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nova said it was heartwarming to see Jin Wei complete a tournament without breaking down and believed she would be in a position to win a title soon
            </p>

            <p>
                “She can also avoid playing in the qualifying rounds.” Jin Wei is ranked 50th in the world

            <p>
                The two-time world junior champion will take a one-week break before returning to two competitions – Indonesia International (Oct 11-16) and the Indonesia Masters (Oct 18-23) in Malang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jin Wei has not won any major title although she had reigned as the country’s best before she was affected by her stomach ailment in 2019

                Statistics by Meltwater from 30 September to 3 October showed that chatter surrounding this issue spiked on 30 September and the top keywords included "video of paraplegic", "down aisle", "passenger, "aisle wheelchair", and "disabled man aisle"

                AirAsia has apologised for a paraplegic passenger having to crawl across the cabin to get to his wheelchair when the plane landed at Changi Airport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was also clutching a seat handle for support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The video was accompanied by a caption which explained that the passenger landed at Changi Airport with AirAsia QZ268 from Jakarta on 29 September and were asked to pay SG$40 for an aisle wheelchair when the passenger's seat was only three metres away from the exit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AirAsia is unable to reveal guest details due to privacy laws
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Statistics by Meltwater from 30 September to 3 October showed that chatter surrounding this issue spiked on 30 September and the top keywords included "video of paraplegic", "down aisle", "passenger, "aisle wheelchair", and "disabled man aisle"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A wheelchair service from Indonesia to Singapore costs approximately IDR120,000 (SG$11)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AirAsia also contributed 36% of the complaints surrounding flight cancellations

                Customer experience is no doubt an important aspect of a customer's relationship with brands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The study also revealed that 66% of customers are less patient than last year, while 64% of companies say customer service has a direct impact on business performance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To remain on top, companies need to evolve the role of customer experience by rethinking the role of support teams

            <p>
                They are also 62% more likely to find sales opportunities during customer interactions compared to starters, which are still relatively early in their customer experience maturity

                As for the Corolla Sport, which matches the hatchback European and United States customers get, it receives a more expressive front apron with more prominent fog lamp surrounds as well as an arrow-themed insert for its lower intake

            <p>
                The hybrid powertrain comes with an e-CVT to send drive to the front wheels, although the Corolla and Corolla Touring can also be had with the E-Four all-wheel drive system that adds a rear 1WM electric motor with 41 PS and 84 Nm

                The Corolla retails for between 1.99 and 2.998 million yen (RM63,756 and RM96,050) in Japan, while the Corolla Touring is from 2.07 to 3.048 million yen (RM66,319 to RM97,652) and the Corolla Sport is priced between 2.2 and 2.89 million yen (RM70,485 and RM92,592)

                Already, the recent reopening of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan is likely to further increase year-end flights, as airlines respond to demand from Asian travellers, he said

            <p>
                Pre-Covid-19, China accounted for about 20 per cent of Singapore's tourists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We plan with the capacity in mind, but we also need to be vigilant." He was responding to questions from Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC) and Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC), who were concerned about Changi Airport's capacity to handle higher year-end flight volumes during the winter season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saktiandi was also worried that the authorities might have over-budgeted when it set the target for 80 per cent of pre-Covid-19 flights by the year end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Iswaran said there is predictability to these figures, which are derived from airlines when they submit to Changi Airport for flight slots that they operate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had said previously that the sector wanted to hire another 4,000 people by the year end, restoring manpower to 90 per cent of 2019 levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From Oct 30, there will be an additional daily service to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport, bringing the number of flights SIA operates daily to Japan’s capital to four
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will also be a second daily flight to Osaka

                This comes after the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, EP Blueshark had received approval by the road transport department (JPJ) for the licensing and registration of its electric two-wheeler products, which itself followed the conditional approval for the construction of its first manufacturing plant in Malaysia

                The approval from MITI was granted under the Industrial Coordination Act 1975, and has been applied retrospectively from July 25, 2022, the company said

                Having received the manufacturing license from MITI, EP Manufacturing will, in its initial years be on its way to producing 50,000 units of the Blueshark electric scooter per year, it said, and foresees that future demand will call for increased production capacity

            <p>
                The Blueshark R1 weighs 92 kg without batteries, has a payload rating of 200 kg and a seat height of 760 mm, along with linked front and rear disc brakes

                Many researchers are advocating for and urging the government to impose foreign exchange (forex) controls, that is pegging the ringgit to the US dollar, to mitigate the current and expected decline in the value of the ringgit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Is this the right move? First of all, we have to realise that the currency depreciation is not unique to Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Secondly, exchange rate controls would mean intervention in the forex market to defend the ringgit and this will come at a hefty price to the country’s foreign exchange reserves (see chart)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the exchange rate is fixed as proposed, the country is likely to experience a drop in competitiveness due to external shocks, which will affect its reserves
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Studies have also shown that a fixed exchange rate is unsustainable when there is an unexpected increase in government spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Broadly speaking, a currency contagion or spillover can happen in the short, or medium to long term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The short-term drivers of currency contagion are often associated with market sentiments, financial panic and herding behaviour, as Keynes (1970) famously said, “It is better to have failed conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.” The medium to long-term currency contagion or spillover is usually driven by trade and financial linkages, external shocks and similarities in macroeconomic vulnerability indicators to the country of shock origin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What is needed in the long term is a buffer against the exchange rate shocks by strengthening the fundamentals of the country, which goes beyond the traditional growth and macroeconomic indicators
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the results are not expected to be immediate, it is necessary to ensure the future competitiveness of our country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The policy focus should not be on controlling the exchange rate or implementing a pegged exchange rate regime
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ringgit is expected to rebound and we will experience stronger long-term trends if we can strengthen our economic fundamentals

                The assistant to the director of a hospitality company in Reading said he had wired all his money to the UK in 2019 at an average exchange rate of HK$10.71 with the pound

                Jeffrey Leung, 40, who owns a skiing school based in Niseko, Hokkaido, seized the chance in late August to buy 20 million yen (US$138,220) through a broker at an average exchange rate of HK$1 to 17 yen because he wanted to expand his business

            <p>
                The further slide in yen doesn’t really matter to me and my business partners,” Leung said, emphasising they were not speculating for profit

            <p>
                He said he had spent HK$30,000 to buy yen for the trip a few days ago

            <p>
                “The exchange rate is really alluring, even though the package is more expensive than the period before the pandemic hit

            <p>
                Gabriel Leung Wai-chun, director of the Birdy Exchange Company in Hong Kong, said he had noticed more customers buying yen for travel

            <p>
                They’ve been longing to travel and took advantage of a very low currency rate,” Leung said

            <p>
                “We are seeing Hong Kong investors that are gradually accumulating to benefit from favourable exchange rates.” Casanova added most people that had bought the yen and British currency were people who wanted to travel or relocate and were not speculators

                All in all, next year could shape up to be a bumper year for tourism in Asia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan has announced that it will reopen to all international visitors, allowing individual travel for tourism purposes to restart from October 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thailand, meanwhile, has ended its state of emergency in relation to Covid-19 and, as of October 1, it will no longer be necessary to present proof of vaccination or a negative test upon arrival to enter the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Vietnam, the visa waiver for stays of less than 15 days is once again valid, and a Covid test is no longer mandatory upon arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, in Hong Kong, foreign visitors are no longer required to quarantine on arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, the big hitters of the Asian tourism scene are gearing up to welcome back their visitors after two and a half years of pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, many signals point to more tourists being drawn to the Asian continent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asia will see the smallest increase in rates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, rates could rise by +7% in Dubai
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If 2023 should be a year of recovery for tourism on the Asian continent, the effect will still be limited by several factors

                But more than six weeks on, Casemiro has played just 82 minutes of Premier League football
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is yet to start a league game for his new club and when Ten Hag picked the team to face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, the 30-year-old was left on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The team is doing really well, it's not against Casemiro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He [Casemiro] will find himself in the team but it has to come in a natural way." Ten Hag is set to make changes following the humiliating defeat to City and Casemiro is likely to start against Omonia FC for the Europa League tie in Cyprus on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lisandro Martinez and Antony played under Ten Hag at Ajax; Christian Eriksen, a former Ajax player, trained with the Dutch giants while he recovered from his cardiac arrest; Tyrell Malacia was signed from Feyenoord and would have been on Ajax's radar last summer had Ten Hag stayed in Amsterdam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag was desperate for a No
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you're desperate you pay over the odds, I suppose." Gab Marcotti and Don Hutchison debate whether Casemiro will suit Erik ten Hag's style of play
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those close to Casemiro insist his move to United was nothing to do with money and that he will only earn more than he was doing at Real Madrid if he can help the club get back into the Champions League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "These are the subplots to what Ten Hag has to deal with," the former England defender said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He [Ten Hag] didn't have those problems at Ajax with the players he had, he was very much in control, the master of the universe there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But that was also true of the Manchester derby and Casemiro was forced to watch most of it from the bench.

                But more than six weeks on, Casemiro has played just 82 minutes of Premier League football
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is yet to start a league game for his new club and when Ten Hag picked the team to face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, the 30-year-old was left on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The team is doing really well, it's not against Casemiro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He [Casemiro] will find himself in the team but it has to come in a natural way." Ten Hag is set to make changes following the humiliating defeat to City and Casemiro is likely to start against Omonia FC for the Europa League tie in Cyprus on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lisandro Martinez and Antony played under Ten Hag at Ajax; Christian Eriksen, a former Ajax player, trained with the Dutch giants while he recovered from his cardiac arrest; Tyrell Malacia was signed from Feyenoord and would have been on Ajax's radar last summer had Ten Hag stayed in Amsterdam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag was desperate for a No
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you're desperate you pay over the odds, I suppose." Gab Marcotti and Don Hutchison debate whether Casemiro will suit Erik ten Hag's style of play
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those close to Casemiro insist his move to United was nothing to do with money and that he will only earn more than he was doing at Real Madrid if he can help the club get back into the Champions League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "These are the subplots to what Ten Hag has to deal with," the former England defender said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He [Ten Hag] didn't have those problems at Ajax with the players he had, he was very much in control, the master of the universe there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But that was also true of the Manchester derby and Casemiro was forced to watch most of it from the bench.
