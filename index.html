            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At a press conference here, DAP secretary-general Loke Siew Fook said this was to safeguard the party from a “loophole” in the anti-hopping law
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under the anti-hopping law passed by the Dewan Rakyat last week, an MP who is sacked by the party does not need to vacate the seat, meaning the party loses the seat in the Dewan Rakyat
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said DAP was concerned about elected representatives who no longer supported the party but chose to remain in it
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Loke said opposition to the party and its leaders would be allowed, but elected representatives needed to behave in accordance with the party’s decisions in Parliament
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Some might call DAP draconian for this, but it is only for very specific circumstances where fundamental issues are involved, such as electing the prime minister, or voting on the budget,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                DAP will hold a special congress on Sept 25 to debate the proposed amendments to the party constitution

                China considers Taiwan part of its territory and has never renounced using force to bring it under its control
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The United States warned China against using the visit as a pretext for military action against Taiwan
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Military drills Shortly after Pelosi’s arrival, China’s military announced joint air and sea drills near Taiwan and test launches of conventional missiles in the sea east of Taiwan, with Chinese state news agency Xinhua describing live-fire drills and other exercises around Taiwan from Thursday to Sunday
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s foreign ministry said Pelosi’s visit seriously damages peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, “has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations, and seriously infringes upon China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Before Pelosi’s arrival yesterday, Chinese warplanes buzzed the line dividing the Taiwan Strait

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles was quoted by the Philippine News Agency as saying that the proprietary claim by the heirs was "in the nature of a private claim"
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Marcos Jr's recent statement about the country's territory, Cruz-Angeles explained, also still needs to be clarified

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The President’s articulation of his statement about not giving up a square inch of territory will have to be reduced into writing and into specifics, after which, we will announce these to you if they are in any way related to the Sabah claim," she said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, without knowing the decision of the Madrid Court to cancel Stampa's appointment as an arbitrator, a French arbitration court went ahead with the Sulu descendants' case against Malaysia last September
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Feb 28 this year, the Paris Arbitration Court awarded the Sulu heirs US$14.92bil (RM66.4bil) from Malaysia
            </p>

                The former finance minister refuted a claim by Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob that DAP dominated the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government, pointing out that only six of the 29 ministers in the PH Cabinet were from the party
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Umno is playing on extremist sentiments to win the general election by blaming everything on DAP.” Lim said another of Umno’s “false narratives” was the claim that DAP refused to implement subsidies or direct financial assistance
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said former transport minister Loke Siew Fook, who is now the DAP secretary-general, was the one who proposed the reimbursement of RM555 million to the armed forces pension fund (LTAT), which it spent to take over the concession of the Automatic Enforcement System (AES) for driving offences as per a 2014 government directive
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim said DAP also initiated an 18% toll reduction for the North-South Expressway (PLUS) as the first step towards the complete abolition of PLUS tolls by the end of 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This is in contrast to Ismail’s government, which has failed to reduce toll rates by a single sen,” he said

                Political analyst Anantha Raman Govindasamy of Universiti Malaysia Sabah told FMT he believed Umno made a top-down rather than a grassroots decision in appointing Tengku Zafrul to the Selangor post

                With the rate being restored to 11% after having been cut to 9% in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Universiti Putra Malaysia’s (UPM) Rusmawati Said cautioned that if employees are unable to save now, it would get complicated when they were older

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last year, the employee’s share of the statutory contribution rate to EPF was reduced to 9% to boost disposable income during the pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In July, it was set back to 11%
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rusmawati said an individual earning RM2,000 a month would contribute RM220 based on the current rate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “When employees retire, they will have savings that would allow them to get by.” Barjoyai also said employees should not look at the amount deducted for such contributions as a loss as the sum would eventually “return” with interest
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “EPF isn’t a tax but a long-term saving scheme,” he said, adding that this was the best time to revert to the 11% rate to ensure that retirement plans would not be disrupted

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “How was PJD Link given its approval in principle when Kidex was to be removed from the Selangor State Structural Plan 2035?” He noted that menteri besar Amirudin Shari had “confirmed (Kidex’s) rebranding” at a PKR political bureau meeting last September
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Moqhtar said the coalition was seeking Fadillah’s consideration to review the validity of the PJD Link’s concession agreement since the minister had acknowledged the cancellation of Kidex in Parliament in 2016
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                His statement comes a day after Fadillah met with representatives of “Say No To PJD Link”, a group of Selangor residents against the planned highway, to assure them that the project would have to get the state government’s nod, and approval by the works ministry, before going ahead
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The project was approved in principle by the Cabinet on Nov 12, 2017, and by the Selangor government on Sept 3, 2020

                Nearly seven years after the blog post, Zaid and Najib have a date in court again
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But this time, the former law minister is in Najib’s corner as the Pekan MP appeals his SRC International conviction in the Federal Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib has roped in Zaid’s law firm to take over from lawyer Shafee Abdullah
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Aug 15, on the first day of Najib’s appeal case at the Federal Court, the judges will decide on his application to adduce fresh evidence, something that could well decide the outcome of the case
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, Najib had failed to adduce other new evidence in the Court of Appeal, which his defence said then was fundamental to a fair trial
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Whether the apex court will allow new evidence to be admitted remains to be seen, but Zaid’s involvement in the case will make for an interesting closure to the SRC International case

                Community health specialist Dr Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh said having a PSC look into the bill was wise as it would be able to address the concerns that had been raised

                “We believe most MPs do support the GEG in principle but some fine-tuning to the GEG bill is necessary for its smooth and effective implementation.” Economist Carmelo Ferlito said that it was a good move to refer the GEG bill to the PSC, allowing more time for deliberation

                On March 24, Judicial Commissioner Datuk Mohd Arief Emran Arifin ordered the Pekan Member of Parliament to disclose to SRC’s lawyers in writing his assets in or outside Malaysia, up to the value of RM42 million within 30 days after the order has been served on Najib
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mohd Arief Emran directed that Najib must not remove, dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of any of the assets in and outside Malaysia up to the value of RM42 million, pending the final determination of the suit
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib also disclosed that he had a total of RM1.24 million in an Affin Bank account and a deposit of RM2.52 million with Amanah Saham Nasional Berhad
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Through the affidavit filed on April 25, Najib confirmed that he did not have assets amounting to RM42 million

                On July 28, 2020, the High Court sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined RM210 million after he was found guilty of misappropriating RM42 million belonging to SRC

                Fadillah, who met with representatives of “Say No To PJD Link”, a group of Selangor residents against the planned construction of the controversial elevated highway, also assured them that the project would have to get the state government’s nod, and approval by the works ministry, before going ahead
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “During the meeting, the minister gave a detailed explanation regarding the proposed implementation of the PJD Link project to the representatives,” said the ministry in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “(Fadillah also) expressed the government’s commitment in ensuring that the companies which have proposed the project carry out the environmental impact assessment (EIA), traffic impact assessment (TIA) and social impact assessment (SIA) in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the concession agreement.” The impact assessments have to be submitted by April 5, 2023, a year after the concession agreement was signed on April 5 this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The main objective of the proposed highway is to disperse traffic congestion in Petaling Jaya by providing major connections with six existing highways and five major railways
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the project’s critics claimed it would channel more traffic to the roads in Petaling Jaya and that it was incongruent with the city’s aspiration to achieve low-carbon city status by 2030
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The project was approved in principle by the Cabinet on Nov 12, 2017 and by the Selangor government on Sept 3, 2020

                In a statement, police secretary Noorsiah Saaduddin said 201 roadblocks were set up nationwide during the operation dubbed Ops Tapis Khas

                “Throughout the operation, 9,684 individuals were inspected, out of which 4,243 were arrested for various drug-related offences,” she said, adding that the individuals were aged between 14 and 70 years old

                Deputy defence minister Ikmal Hisham Abdul Aziz said the ministry had completed all tender evaluation processes to acquire the unmanned aircraft for use by the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) to strengthen its defence capability

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the ministry’s procurement board had certified the selected tenderers and submitted them to the finance ministry on July 7

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The maintenance ecosystem would be implemented after the expiry of the warranty period from the original equipment manufacturer, based on the maintenance concept determined by RMAF

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ahmad Tarmizi had asked about the status of the tender, procurement, maintenance for the MALE UAS aircraft during the question-and-answer session

                In reply to a supplementary question from Awang Husaini Sahari (PH-Putatan) regarding the objective of acquiring the system, Ikmal said the aircraft would carry out intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions for the armed forces

                In a written parliamentary reply, Tengku Zafrul said the federal government’s debt stood at RM1.045 trillion, or 63.8% of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), as of the end of June

                “However, 1MDB, SRC and SSER are entities that have received government guarantees under the Loans Guarantee (Bodies Corporate) Act 1965 or Section 14 of the Financial Procedure Act

                It was only after a year later that they finally met up unintentionally, because when Ting first met Chin in person, she did not know that he was the one she had been chatting with as well

                Soo had given a total of RM103,000 to the man between March and May this year, all transactions in cash

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Chin had told him that some of the investments were making losses and that he needed to top up more cash for it to stay afloat, and later also claimed to need money for medical treatment and surgery

                Hamzah said the tier-based assessment used by the US State Department in its annual TIP report was based on its own law on human trafficking, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The report released last month saw Malaysia remain in Tier 3 of the US Trafficking In Persons report
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia was placed on Tier 2 from 2018 to 2020 before dropping to Tier 3, the lowest tier, last year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also refuted several claims in the report, key among them that the country had no safe houses against trafficking in the northern region
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hamzah also said the TIP report incorrectly stated that human trafficking victims in the country were handcuffed
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Larry Sng (PBM-Julau) defended the government and home ministry for Malaysia’s ranking, claiming that several sections of the TIP report, such as that on the palm oil industry, were based on outdated information

                Labuan domestic trade and consumer affairs department director Junaidah Arbain said the sugar was imported by three wholesalers

                The contractor had commenced its lawsuit against the government, transport minister Wee Ka Siong and two others in 2020, seeking to declare that the termination of its contract was illegal, unlawful and a violation of a settlement agreement both parties had previously entered into

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 1 — After Malaysia’s chicken shortage a few months back, the chicken industry has stabilised thanks to several steps taken by the government, said Agriculture and Food Industries (Mafi) Minister Datuk Seri Ronald Kiandee
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “There was a slight disruption in the supply of chicken in the past few months
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                These steps taken by the government can be seen as a success and have stabilised the chicken industry in Malaysia,” he said in Parliament here
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said that the Malaysian chicken industry has been recovering so well that now Malaysia has an oversupply of chicken, causing the price of chicken locally to plummet lower than the ceiling price of chicken set by the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                That means we have the capacity to export chicken from our country to other countries

                He also said it was disappointing that the courts appeared to have not read the 1878 agreement signed by then Sulu Sultan Jamal Al Alam

                However, last September, the French Arbitration court, without knowing the decision of the Madrid Court to cancel Stampa's appointment as an arbitrator, went ahead with the Sulu descendants' case against Malaysia

                Muhyiddin couldn't have done many of these things without the support of the turncoat House Speaker Azhar (Art) Harun

                The first thought that sprang in me on reading Azhar's glowing garlanding of Muhyiddin as a "reformist" had me confused as to who is the "Don Quixote" (impractical idealist) - is it Muhyiddin or Azhar? Muhyiddin’s desperate look for a spot in the roundtable of peers is just a dream

                It’s their right,” he said when asked to comment on BN’s move to appoint Tengku Zafrul

                “Before this, I thought Tengku Zafrul served Muhyiddin Yassin, so I’m surprised that he chose Umno.” The Seremban MP was speaking to reporters at the launch of a DAP fundraiser in preparation for the next general election (GE15)

                Tengku Zafrul was the CEO of CIMB Group Holdings Bhd when then prime minister Muhyiddin picked him for the finance portfolio in March 2020

                However, last May, Umno secretary-general Ahmad Maslan revealed that he had been an Umno member even before he became a federal minister in 2020
