                In a post on his official Facebook page on Friday (Aug 12), Dr Wee said this was the first bilateral Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) that Malaysia has with a foreign country
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "This MRA will facilitate all citizens of both countries who can then ultimately contribute to the development of the social and economic sectors of both Malaysia and the Republic of Maldives," he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He then thanked his counterpart from the Republic of Maldives, Aishath Nahula, (Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation) for co-signing the MRA with Transport Ministry Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "I am pleased to welcome Aishath and her delegation together with Maldives Minister of State for Transport and Civil Aviation Ahmed Zuhair, Deputy High Commissioner of Maldives to Malaysia Mariyam Mizna Shareef

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Dr Wee added that he looked forward to having more collaborative arrangements in transport with the Maldives.

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Anwar had announced last Saturday (Aug 6) that Sangkar would be the Sabah PKR state leadership council chairman for the 2022-2025 period, replacing Liew who has held the post since October 2016

                KINIGUIDE | Over the last two weeks, the country has been gripped by the latest multi-billion ringgit scandal involving the Royal Malaysian Navy’s (RMN) second generation patrol vessel - more commonly known as the littoral combat ship (LCS) - project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                What is an LCS?  The concept was first introduced by the US Navy with two classes of LCS - Freedom and Independence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The concept is for cheap - for the US - small, and stealthy surface combat vessels for littoral zone warfare and operations
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Littoral warfare means military operations in the littoral zone

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Apart from the US, Malaysia is the only country to have surface combatants designated as LCS

                Karl Andersson from the University of Manchester spent three months researching how readers “experience sexual pleasure” when reading Japanese shota comics
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I had hit a wall in my research,” Anderson wrote in the abstract of his 4,000-word article published in the journal Qualitative Research
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “And so I realised that my body was equipped with a research tool of its own that could give me, quite literally, a first-hand understanding of shota.” Andersson, who is originally from Sweden, also concluded that masturbation could be an act of “self-care”, and that the activity was when “we are least alone”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Thinking more critically about my own masturbation also made me wonder if all sex is masturbation, in the sense that people are focused on their own pleasure and use other people as ‘masturbation material’,” he wrote
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While the paper was originally published online in April, it went viral on Twitter earlier this week, sparking debate about research ethics and values

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Many questioned the ethics of the paper, saying it was bordering on paedophilia due to the nature of shota comics

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 12 — Parti Bangsa Malaysia (PBM) is urging the federal government to enact new legislation criminalising cyberbullying
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As a point of reference, Muniraa cited an example of Singapore's Protection from Harassment Act
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Enacted in 2014, the law was designed specifically to make cyberbullying, stalking and online harassment within and out of the workplace a criminal offence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Stressing the need to stamp out the menace, Muniraa also cited a Unicef report which had ranked Malaysia second in Asia for cyberbullying among youths in 2020
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She also said victims should also have easy access to counsellors while being taught online etiquette and how to respond when harassed by online bullies

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Citing the Public Accounts Committee’s (PAC) report on the project, Bukit Mertajam MP Steven Sim said then defence minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had decided on the SETIS system instead of the navy’s choice of the Tacticos system
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The SETIS system chosen by the minister is not only more expensive, it has yet to be fully developed, and is also at risk of becoming obsolete in five to 10 years
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sim said switching from the initial Sigma-class ships chosen by the navy to the Gowind design of Naval Group of France in 2011 could have set Malaysia’s naval ship manufacturing industry back by years
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Malaysia missed out on the chance for technology transfer, pointing to how the Sigma-class was designed by the Dutch company Damen Shipyard, which was supposed to make Malaysia its manufacturing hub
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said this would have allowed for important technology transfer for the local combat ship manufacturing industry while creating high-value jobs for Malaysians

                The former finance minister said the tax should be waived until after the “threat” of an expected recession was over

                This flat rate will be imposed on LVG sold online priced below RM500 and will come into effect from next January

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Tabling the bill, deputy finance minister Shahar Abdullah said the government was expected to collect RM200 million a year from the implementation of this tax

                Lim acknowledged that there was a need to create a level playing field but argued that the government should have instead waived the 10% sales tax for local suppliers

                However, Rewcastle Brown also made the reference application to have the Federal Court determine the constitutionality of the charge

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Section 84(2) of the CoJA allowed the High Court to stay proceedings should the constitutionality question be referred to the Federal Court

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Justice Department asked a judge on Thursday to make public the warrant that authorized the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, after Trump, a Republican, portrayed it as political retribution

                The Say Hong Chun and an effigy of the King of Hades (Tai Su Yeah) will be burnt in a final ritual to send off departed loved ones to mark the seventh lunar month celebration

                “The MRDC will be developing professional, skilled and semi-skilled talent in the rail industry, improving standards, assuring quality as well as coordinating rail technology studies and research by higher learning institutions through collaboration with local industry players in order to keep up with the needs of the industry,” said Dr Wee at the launch of the Rail Technology Expo (RTX) at KL Sentral yesterday

                The Malaysian government adopted the LEP in 1982, and targeted social and economic development in the country through learning from Japan

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail Sabri said four decades of successful cooperation between Malaysia and Japan were now centred on new areas in line with the technological revolution that brought changes to the industrial and global economic landscape
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                “I hope the Japanese government will provide continuous support to encourage more cooperation through the implementation of joint-venture projects under the LEP,” he added

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail said as a pioneer in the global halal industry, Malaysia can help Japan develop its halal industry

                “Malaysia as a pioneer in the global halal industry can certainly help Japan which has a high interest in developing its halal industry.” Ismail Sabri also suggested that both countries explore cooperation to resolve problems related to supply chains, adding that during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in May, he called for regional supply chains to be strengthened with supporting investment in digital infrastructure

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia University of Science and Technology economics professor Geoffrey Williams told StarBiz that a ringgit to US dollar peg should not be the government’s policy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Tengku Zafrul explained that a peg would not be the best move for the economy, as it would require Malaysia to follow the monetary policy of the country to which the ringgit is pegged to

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Williams also explained that it is a fallacy to claim one can “buck the market” and control the exchange rate because the ringgit’s value depends on the value of the US dollar as well, which one cannot control

                The Parti Solidariti Tanah Airku (STAR) president also said that GRS would be monitoring the political situation in Peninsular Malaysia, which he described as being “very fluid” and might turn out to be a “free-for-all”

                In a Facebook post, Sydney Yap said that “instead of taking positive action” to review the working conditions of journalists after she raised concerns about various bureaucratic practices in Bernama, the agency’s CEO Roslan Ariffin had instead “made false allegations to me (sic)”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “… (this) is extremely unprofessional and I will post a full statement to respond as soon as possible.” However, the newsreader did not elaborate on the false accusations allegedly made by Roslan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yap, who is set to leave the news agency, previously said she wanted to speak out during her final days at Bernama in order to raise awareness of problems faced by the media
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was previously reported that Bernama wanted to sue the newsreader for alleged defamation over claims that the Mandarin broadcast news unit was seeing pay cuts and less airtime
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yap wrote a lengthy Facebook post last week after Bernama announced that its 6pm Mandarin news programme would only air from Monday to Friday
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, speaking to Malaysiakini yesterday, Roslan said that the message circulated to the media that Yap would face legal action was actually an internal report and recommendation from Bernama’s human resources department

                During the interview, Pelosi said that "it was only about saying, China is one of the freest societies in the world, don't take it from me, that's from Freedom House, it's a strong democracy, courageous people." Soon after Pelosi's tongue slip, Drew Hammill, her deputy chief of staff tweeted that what Pelosi referred here is the island of Taiwan

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The transcript of the interview from Pelosi's website also replaced "China" with "Taiwan" in this sentence
