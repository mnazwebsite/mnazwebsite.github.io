                The maximum price of bottled cooking oil is to be fixed after negotiations with manufacturers failed, task force chairman Annuar Musa said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Discussions with manufacturers to lower the price of cooking oil had proven ineffective despite the decline in crude palm oil prices

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Annuar had urged manufacturers to lower the price last week, as the price of crude palm oil had dropped from RM7,000 per tonne to RM3,600 per tonne this week

                He said it also raised questions as to whether Apandi was aware of the fugitive businessman’s current whereabouts as well as his role in the 1MDB case

                Isn’t he now in a position of conflict of interest by helping Jho Low?,” Rafique said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Pejuang’s Youth wing information chief Akif Rusli said Apandi’s position as a “middleman” for Jho Low begged the question as to whether he had received any payment to help arrange the meeting

                “There are elements of treason since Apandi was responsible (as the AG at the time) for determining whether Najib would be investigated, and now Najib has been proven guilty at the High Court and Court of Appeal.” Akif pointed out that Jho Low’s alleged RM1.5 billion offer to the government to settle the charges against him were a mere 10% compared to the current RM15.8 billion suit against him by 1MDB and its four subsidiaries

                At 29, Dusty is in a wheelchair and severely impacted by Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a muscle-wasting disease that affects one in 3,500 boys

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When Dusty was diagnosed with the rare condition in the 1990s, Jayasuriya founded Coalition Duchenne, a non-profit organisation that aims to raise global awareness and funding for the condition

                Dusty and the challenges faced by people with Duchenne have inspired Ravi Everest, Coalition Duchenne’s official climbing partner, to become involved with the cause

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail filed the suit in February against the defendant for publishing an article titled “Ismail Sabri bimbang jadi PM paling singkat, ‘rayu’ jangan tarik sokongan”, saying it implied that he had begged his Perikatan Nasional allies for their continued support

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his statement of claim, Ismail said the posting, in its ordinary meaning and by inference, meant that he was concerned about ending up as the prime minister with the shortest tenure in Malaysian history

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 — Residents of Desa Sri Hartamas and Segambut MP Hannah Yeoh gathered today to object to a proposed development plan that they say will contribute to the traffic congestion in the area
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The noticeboard also displayed a picture suggesting a high-rise office building and a condominium will be built on the land
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “There’s no way a higher plot ratio here will increase the quality of life of our residents because of the congestion that is already here,” she added
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is understood that the proposed development plan involves land with a water sewage facility
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Multiple local representatives also spoke about the negative impact that a high-density development plan would have on the already congested road

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In addition, president of Desa Sri Hartamas Owners and Traders Association Abu Bakar Ibrahim said that DBKL should conduct a traffic impact assessment, environment impact assessment, and social impact assessment of the proposed development plan to make sure that the neighbourhood remains liveable

                About Us Advertise LONDON, July 25 — Rishi Sunak yesterday promised to get tough on China if he becomes Britain’s next prime minister, calling the Asian superpower the “number one threat” to domestic and global security
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s state-run Global Times has previously said Sunak was the only candidate in the contest with “a clear and pragmatic view on developing UK-China ties”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yet British government policy when both Sunak and Truss were in Johnson’s cabinet has warned about China before

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In March last year, its integrated review of security, defence and foreign policy called China “the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At the same time, London has recognised that China’s power and international assertiveness was here to stay, and called Beijing a “systemic competitor”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In July last year, Sunak himself called for a more nuanced approach to the debate on China

                He said a statement had been released a few hours ago to rebuke Lim's statement but he was adamant about his mistake and chose to attack him for not seeing the 12,000 road fatalities allegedly caused by mat rempit

                “The lessons from Covid-19 remain relevant for monkeypox,” global health specialist Dr Khor Swee Kheng said, adding that WHO’s announcement of monkeypox as a “public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)” highlighted the vigilance that countries needed to adopt against the disease

                Public health expert Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar urged the health authorities to embark on a strict epidemiological surveillance of monkeypox cases and develop appropriate prevention plans

                "Kalibr missiles destroyed Odesa port's military infrastructure, sending a Ukrainian military boat to the Kiev regime's favourite address in a precision strike," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The "favourite address" is an ironic reference to the exhortations of Ukrainian forces on Snake Island in the Black Sea who reportedly told a Russian ship to "go f***" itself before a Russian strike in February
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy denounced the strikes on Odesa as blatant "barbarism" that showed Moscow could not be trusted to implement Friday's deal, mediated by Turkey and the United Nations
            </p>

                The Ukrainian military had said Russian missiles hit the southern port on Saturday

                He said the tripartite agreement involving the then Sultan of Sulu, Sultan Jamal Al Alam, the then maharaja of Sabah, Baron de Overbeck, and British North Borneo Company’s Alfred Dent was written in Malay using the Jawi script
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The agreement has no reference for parties to resolve any dispute of North Borneo (Sabah) by way of arbitration,” he told FMT
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the 2019 letter to the lawyer of the Sulu heirs sighted by FMT, Thomas attached a copy of a 1939 judgment by the North Borneo High Court and said Malaysia did not dispute the identity of the individuals and their right to be paid
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Firoz said Malaysia had no choice but to set aside the award but it was going to be a “challenging” task because of Article 5 of the New York Convention
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under the agreement, Jamal ceded sovereignty over large parts of Sabah to Dent and Overbeck, who agreed that they and their future heirs were to pay the heirs of the sultan 5,000 Mexican dollars annually
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Although Malaysia took over these payments when it became the successor of the agreement following Sabah’s independence and the formation of Malaysia in 1963, these payments – equivalent to RM5,300 a year – ceased in 2013 after an incursion by armed men into Lahad Datu, along the eastern coast of Sabah

                Asked whether the MoU would push for the 15th General Election to be held earlier as claimed by certain parties, Hasni said that there would not be much difference if the election were to be held now

                The family of Kim Shih Keat, 36, have called for an inquest to be held and for a joint investigation by the police, the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission and the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam)

                Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh said it was important for the police to release the post-mortem report as the family could look into the possibility of an inquest

                Ramkarpal said he would ask the Johor prosecution director to look into the case, especially the post-mortem report, as the cause of death is still unknown
