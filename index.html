                According to newspaper Sinar Harian, Pejuang chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said that the remaining 80 parliamentary seats out of the 120-seat target by the party may be contested by Pejuang’s allies
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For these 80 Malay-majority seats, Dr Mahathir said those from Barisan Pejuang — non-governmental organisations and minor political parties that are cooperating with Pejuang — would be able to use Pejuang’s flag and symbol to contest GE15, despite not being party members
            </p>

                “For those dissatisfied with the current government, they can be involved in the election process and may become members of the administration formed with Pejuang in the future
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Maybe not in the form of a government by Pejuang and other parties, but together with an NGO front, especially the Malays

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “We believe NGO people, academics and professionals can be together with Pejuang and other small political parties to form an informal front to contest using one symbol and one flag (Pejuang),” he was quoted as saying by Sinar Harian
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This shows that a Malay-majority led government will be fair to all races,” he was also quoted as saying, and added that this is Pejuang’s stand.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 22 — The High Court here today dismissed an application by the prosecution to stay the execution of an order for the return of property seized from former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, his wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, their sons and several other individuals

                The site visit was supposed to end then, but on the insistence of the Jenkins’ family lawyer, Raveentharan Subramaniam, the court headed to Batu Gantong, where Jenkin’s skeletal remains were found three years after her disappearance

                In his statement of defence in a suit filed against him by Shahril, Rafizi said he raised the issue as Shahril's remuneration when he served as the CEO did not commensurate with Sapura's financial performance

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                MSWG, meanwhile, raised the issue of Shahril's remuneration package being excessive which had been brought up at a previous Sapura AGM

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The MSWG had further condemned Sapura's corporate governance mechanism at the 2018 AGM and the payment of the intellectual property rights, trademark and branding fee to Sapura Holdings Sdn Bhd in which Shahril holds a direct shareholding,” Rafizi added in his defence statement

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Shahril, who is presently the president and Group CEO of Sapura Group, had filed the suit via Messrs Zul Rafique & Partners following Rafizi's statement questioning the remuneration and the move to inject more public funds to bail out the company

                He said that between 2009 and 2021, Sapura had paid Shahril approximately RM1.1 billion in total remuneration, of which RM980 million to RM990 million was paid during Najib's tenure as the Prime Minister from 2009 to 2018

                About Us Advertise SIBU, July 22 — Sarawak Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg urged the federal government tonight to swiftly honour the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) in its entirety, in the spirit of Keluarga Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “What our Sarawak leaders had included then as provisions in the agreement as part of Malaysia were what they considered as necessary to protect the rights and interests of Sarawak and its people during their time, during our time and after our time,” he said at the Sarawak Day celebration at the Indoor Stadium here
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He noted that the events leading to the surrender of power of self-government to Sarawak on July 22, 1963 followed by the formation of Malaysia on September 16, 1963 based on MA63
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said agreement signed by Britain, Federation of Malaya, Sarawak, Sabah (North Borneo) and Singapore was a foundation on the formation of Malaysia which was recognised by the United Nations
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Singapore was later expelled from the Federation of Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As the head of the Sarawak government, I call on the federal government to facilitate the next consultation on MA63 for the good of the country as a whole,” he said

                Sabah Law Society president Roger Chin said Thomas’s admission had put Malaysia in a tight spot in its efforts to defend itself against the Sulu claim
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Thus the contents of Thomas’ letter were clearly “relied upon” by the Sulu claimants in their arbitration claim against Malaysia in Madrid and Paris, said Chin
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said that Thomas should have taken steps to defend Malaysia against the Spanish arbitration claim, instead of merely not recognising the Spanish court’s jurisdiction to arbitrate the Sulu claim
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Resorting to copying letters to the Spanish arbitrator was an admission that Malaysia was aware of the case, said Chin
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also questioned if Thomas had consulted the then de facto law minister Liew Vui Keong before responding to the Sulu heir’s letter of demand

                A source told FMT that Santhara submitted a letter to Bersatu secretary-general Hamzah Zainudin last week on his departure from the party
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Bersatu is trying to persuade him to change his mind, but he has said he will be going ahead with it.”  Santhara was the first non-Bumiputera MP to join Bersatu in August 2020

                In January this year, Santhara said he was staying on with Bersatu despite receiving numerous offers to join other parties in the next general election (GE15)

                When urged to take action against Tajuddin yesterday, Dewan Rakyat Speaker Azhar Harun said he would discuss the matter with deputy speaker Rashid Hasnon, who oversaw proceedings when the incident occurred
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It said the disproportionate action against the two MPs showed the deputy speaker’s poor judgment and also that the Standing Orders were ill-equipped to punish MPs who make offensive remarks in the Dewan Rakyat
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The SCPP called for Standing Order 36 to be amended to automatically refer any MP who makes any sexist, racist and offensive remarks to the rights and privileges committee
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It said the Standing Order must also provide for a fine of at least RM500 while the severity of punishments should be higher for repeat offenders, including suspension
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “While sexist, racist, treacherous, subversive and offensive expressions are all ‘out of order’ under Standing Order 36(4) and (10), no penalty is provided
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “To effectively deter vulgarity, the SCPP calls upon the Speaker as the chair of the Standing Order Committee to convene the committee and have the amendment of Standing Order 36 passed before the Parliament meeting ends in August,” it said

                Immigration director-general Khairul Dzaimee Daud said the operation was mounted following complaints that illegal immigrants had been carrying out fishing activities in the coastal areas and that it was affecting local fishermen’s catch

                “Yet, he (Mahathir) is now blaming the Barisan Nasional (BN) administration for stopping the payment to the heirs of the Sulu sultanate,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the report, Mahathir said the payment should be stopped because the alleged Sulu descendants had allegedly breached the terms

                Rizal, whose full name is Mohd Rizal Van Geyzel, claimed trial to the charges after they were read out by a court interpreter before Sessions Court judge Nor Hasniah Ab Razak yesterday
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rizal was charged under Section 233(1)(a) of the Communications and Multimedia Act, an offence punishable under Section 233(3) of the same Act
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the prosecution suggested RM30,000 bail if the court uses its discretion to grant bail to the accused
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lawyer Ramkarpal Singh asked the court to allow a RM2,000 bail for each charge
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Judge Nor Hasniah then granted RM12,000 bail for all charges and ordered Rizal to surrender his passport to the court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is learnt that Rizal paid the bail
