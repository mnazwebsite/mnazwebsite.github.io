            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said the decision to choose the party vice-president was made during a meeting with the party division leaders from Penang, Kedah and Perlis
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "During the meeting, I have explained to division leaders why the party top leadership has assigned the party deputy president and party vice-presidents to lead the election machinery in every state in Malaysia except for Sabah and Sarawak," he said at a press conference at the state party's headquarters in Bayan Baru here on Thursday (Aug 11)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said with the appointment, he hopes that the states’ party election machinery will be strengthened
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Anwar was also asked about which seat he is going to contest for GE15

                After the press conference Anwar was treated to a surprise birthday party by state PKR members to celebrate his 75th birthday.

                In a Facebook post, Sydney Yap said that “instead of taking positive action” to review the working conditions of journalists after she raised concerns about various bureaucratic practices in Bernama, the agency’s CEO Roslan Ariffin had instead “made false allegations to me (sic)”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “… (this) is extremely unprofessional and I will post a full statement to respond as soon as possible.” However, the newsreader did not elaborate on the false accusations allegedly made by Roslan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yap, who is set to leave the news agency, previously said she wanted to speak out during her final days at Bernama in order to raise awareness of problems faced by the media
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was previously reported that Bernama wanted to sue the newsreader for alleged defamation over claims that the Mandarin broadcast news unit was seeing pay cuts and less airtime
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yap wrote a lengthy Facebook post last week after Bernama announced that its 6pm Mandarin news programme would only air from Monday to Friday
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, speaking to Malaysiakini yesterday, Roslan said that the message circulated to the media that Yap would face legal action was actually an internal report and recommendation from Bernama’s human resources department

                Today, the Singapore Police Force said that it had been “working closely with various foreign law enforcement agencies” to secure the couple’s return to Singapore
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Singapore police then sought the Royal Malaysia Police’s help to locate them

                The couple was arrested by Malaysian police today and handed over to SPF

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They will face charges of criminal conspiracy to commit cheating as well as illegal departure from Singapore

                Two Malaysian men have already been charged with conspiring to arrange for the couple to be smuggled out of Singapore in a Malaysia-registered lorry through Tuas Checkpoint on July 4

                It is nothing new,” he said at a press conference after the launch of TalentCorp’s mynext initiative
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He pointed out that some people were inclined to work dangerous, dirty and difficult jobs in another country as opposed to their own due to the lucrative income
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saravanan said several factors like minimum wage and the economy needed to be considered to adequately solve the brain drain issue in the country
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Saravanan said the struggle his ministry was facing was unemployability due to skills mismatch which could be traced back to the outdated education system
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On a different note, Saravanan said it was “typical” of DAP’s Kula Segaran to call him out last week for allegedly failing to provide an adequate answer on the money spent by the Human Resources Development Corporation (HRD Corp) for overseas trips

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Court of Appeal judge Justice Kamaludin Md Said in his written grounds of judgment of last Friday's appellate court's 2-1 majority decision in disallowing citizenship to children born overseas to Malaysian mothers and foreign fathers, said the word "father" in Section 1(b) of Part II of the Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution refers to father only and is not intended to include the mother
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This means it precluded Malaysian mothers who are married to a non-Malaysian citizen from passing on their citizenship status to their children who were born outside Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the remedy for Malaysian mothers who are married to foreign spouses to get Malaysian citizenship for their children who were born overseas is provided under Article 15(2) of the Federal Constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said Article 14(1)(b) of the Federal Constitution and Section 1(b) of Part II of the Federal Constitution were not gendered discriminatory against women
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the word "father' in Section 1(b) Part II of the Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution should be read in a non-discriminatory way to include "mother' as by virtue of Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution, and it will be unconstitutional to practise gender discrimination by recognising the blood descent of the father, but not that of the mother for purposes of according citizenship to children born overseas
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Friday, the Court of Appeal panel had also made it clear that the status quo should be maintained for overseas-born children of the six Malaysian mothers who had obtained citizenship, pending disposal of their appeal to the Federal Court

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairy said that out of six million Malaysians who qualified for the screening programme, only 600,000 or 10% had come forward for their free screening
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “And perhaps there is a fear of finding out that they are suffering from something.” Khairy said it was important to change the perception that screening would bring “bad news”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that the general perspective toward health screenings had to be changed from one that was “almost fatalistic” to one that was more “corrective”

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On a separate issue, Khairy said the uptake for Covid-19 second dose booster shots was still quite low

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the low uptake had been expected but the health ministry would continue to recommend and encourage those aged 50 years and older, especially those with health risks, to get their booster shots

                In a statement, health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the ministry was notified of the product recall throughout the European market last month

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the product recall in Malaysia was voluntarily conducted by the company that imported the ice cream

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The vanilla ice cream was produced using vanilla extracts imported from Madagascar that contained ETO above the permissible amount for consumption

                The former Pandan MP alleged that Lodin ceded control of the project to CAD during a BHIC board meeting on April 28, 2010, more than a year before the government appointed BHIC subsidiary Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) as the LCS contractor via direct negotiations

                Rafizi explained that LTAT, a subsidiary of Boustead Heavy Industries Corporation (BHIC), approved the purchase of a 51 per cent stake in CAD, with the other 49 per cent going to Rheinmetall Air Defense AG (RAD), a German defence contractor company held through subsidiaries wholly owned company RD Investment AG
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that the purchase agreement between CAD and BHIC agreed that RAD has management control over CAD despite the fact that it is owned in majority by BHIC
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As a result of that ridiculous decision, CAD is only owned by Boustead and LTAT on paper

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The CEO and CFO, the two most important management positions in CAD, were agreed to be appointed by RAD instead of Boustead and LTAT,” he said, adding that the current CEO of CAD is one Gordon Hargreave who represents RAD

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said that the decision to give management control to the smaller shareholder was approved by chairman of the BHIC board of directors Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, who is the former CEO of LTAT

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, Aug 11 — The prosecution today rested its case after calling in a total of 18 witnesses and presenting more than a hundred documents in court in former home minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi’s case — where he is charged with receiving bribes from Ultra Kirana Sdn Bhd (UKSB)

                She also said the prosecution would also be offering a list of 27 witnesses that Ahmad Zahid could call to testify in his defence, if the High Court decides to call Ahmad Zahid to enter his defence

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Following the close of the prosecution’s case today, the High Court has fixed September 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 for oral submissions for both sides to present their final arguments before High Court judge Datuk Mohd Yazid Mustafa decides on whether the prosecution had made out its prima facie case

                A decision at the end of the prosecution case would be on whether there is a sufficient case for Zahid to be called to enter his defence or whether he would be freed of the charges

                Taiwan's drill on Thursday came after Beijing ended its largest-ever military exercises around the island, as China repeated threats to bring the self-ruled democracy under its control

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, Aug 11 ― A Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigator today disagreed with the defence team in Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi's foreign visa system (VLN) contract corruption trial that the prosecution against the former home minister was politically motivated and selectively conducted
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mahendran, who is also the 18th prosecution witness and investigating officer assigned to the case, made the assertion under cross-examination by defence lawyer Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Zainal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ahmad Zaidi then further cross-examined the witness on whether those named in a ledger UKSB owned for bookkeeping purposes on cash payments made by UKSB to various politicians, government staff and Ahmad Zahid himself have been called for questioning
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The witness also disagreed with the defence suggestion that there was no other documentary evidence supporting the charges filed against Ahmad Zahid except those of the ledger and witness testimonies of those from UKSB
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mahendran replied in the negative

                Ahmad Zahid was charged with another seven counts as home minister who obtained S$1.15 million, RM3 million, S₣15,000 and US$15,000 in cash from the same company for himself in connection with his official work

                According to a police statement, the six victims, aged between 24 and 44, were forced to work long hours at a cement factory after being duped by an employment agent

                “However, upon arriving, costs for travel and passports were deducted every month from their salaries and they were forced to work long hours to pay off this ‘debt’,” South Klang district police chief Cha Hoong Fong said

                “The agent had also confiscated their passports and, despite being promised work permits, they were forced to work without valid documents.” Cha said the case is being investigated under Section 44 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007

                Ayadali noted that there was no specific law in Malaysia to deal with cyberbullying despite a lot of talk about it for many years

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said it remained a huge challenge to eradicate cyberbullying, considering the many forms of online social interactions

                The virus, named Langya henipavirus or LayV, was found thanks to an early detection system for feverish people with a recent history of exposure to animals in eastern China

                There was no evidence they had been in close contact or had a common exposure history, suggesting human infection may be sporadic, the researchers said

                Former minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Redzuan Yusof said this could be done by eliminating the “senior” rank of certain ministers and reducing the number of deputy ministers

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was asked to comment on the debate among various parties on Bersatu pressing Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob to keep his pledge of offering the party the deputy prime minister’s post in exchange for its support to him for the premiership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This would have given an impression that the new prime minister is being frugal and has initiated impactful changes with reduced expenditure
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Having senior ministers with perks has been seen by the public as not being aligned to what the rakyat wants.” On speculation that a Bersatu survey among its Supreme Council members had chosen its secretary-general Hamzah Zainudin over vice-president Azmin Ali to be nominated as the deputy prime minister, Redzuan said he was not aware of this

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong Chin Huat of Sunway University said Azalina’s proposal for a recall election mechanism would be the best way of plugging loopholes such as one that leaves a party at a disadvantage if it were to sack a member who is an MP
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under the bill passed by the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara, MPs sacked by their parties would retain their seats, which means a party would lose out for taking action against an MP
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under Azalina’s proposal, a by-election could be triggered if 40% of the voters in a constituency signed a recall petition, if an MP were to be sacked by his or her party or if a party were to quit a coalition
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The power to punish party-hoppers would then be with the voters,” Wong told FMT
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This is something DAP plans to do by amending its constitution so that elected representatives who do not toe the party line on fundamental issues will automatically lose their membership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But he said the danger of this “roundabout remedy” is that the party constitution might become so constraining that MPs might lose their autonomy and become yes men

                In a Facebook post, Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi said the state government has presented its findings regarding the coordination of weekend rest days for His Majesty the Sultan of Johor’s consideration
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was first reported on June 14 that the Johor government is reviewing the current Friday and Saturday weekend rest days in the state following complaints by the public

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Following that, Malay Mail reported on June 20 that the state government may implement an official two-and-a-half-day weekend, with Friday as a half-day, followed by Saturday and Sunday as weekend rest days
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In late 2013, Sultan Ibrahim decreed the change of the state’s weekend rest days to Friday and Saturday from Saturday and Sunday

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Since January 1, 2014, Johor has been observed Friday and Saturday as its official weekend rest days

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Emilia’s counsel Nizam Bashir Abdul Kariem Bashir argued that Article 126 of the Federal Constitution indicated that the power to initiate committal proceedings lies within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, Court of Appeal and the High Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nizam said the Kuala Lumpur shariah court could not hear the committal proceedings against his client because she is no longer a resident of the Federal Territory and now lives in Kajang, Selangor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also rejected Emilia’s application to suspend the ongoing committal proceedings in the shariah high court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Other respondents are the Registrar of the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court, the Chief Registrar of the Federal Territories shariah court of appeal, the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court, the Kuala Lumpur shariah court of appeal and the government of Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Based on the judicial review application, Emilia said she did not live or reside in the Federal Territory during the “hadhanah” (custody) proceedings filed at the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court on July 23, 2018
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Emilia sought a declaration that the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court and shariah court of appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear and punish any individual who contravenes the court, as it is the exclusive rights of the civil courts, according to Article 126 of the Federal Constitution

                Judicial Commissioner Roz Mawar Rozain, in her decision, said it was unfair to have the charge looming over Hasanah’s head

                According to the Sexual Health and Intimate Wellness Survey 2022, which spoke to over 1,000 Malaysians aged between 18 and 30, 35.4% of them had had sexual intercourse, compared to 18.8% from the first survey in 2016

                Third Warrant Officer Jeffrey Heng suffered some injuries when he landed during the National Day Parade
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                3WO Heng, the last of 10 parachutists to land, was stretchered off after his rough landing on Tuesday that saw him tumble to the ground
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                We wish a speedy recovery to 3WO Jeffrey!" 3WO Heng had attempted to land at a safe distance away from his teammates, while fighting against strong crosswinds, said retired commando Chan Seck Sung, who was in the audience at the Marina Bay floating platform and witnessed 3WO Heng’s hard landing

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                You should just land where the wind takes you,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “It is also best to land on grass because it is softer.” Chan added that parachutists are trained to break their fall by rolling on the ground

                While the Red Lions land flawlessly most times given their gruelling training, there have been other accidents

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Taiwan rejects China’s sovereignty claims, says the island’s people should decide its future and vows to defend its democracy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China had said in two previous white papers on Taiwan, in 1993 and 2000, that it “will not send troops or administrative personnel to be based in Taiwan” after achieving unification
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                That line, meant to assure Taiwan it would enjoy autonomy after becoming a special administrative region of China, did not appear in the latest white paper
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s ruling Communist Party had proposed that Taiwan could return to its rule under a “one country, two systems” model, similar to the formula under which the former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A line in the 2000 white paper that said “anything can be negotiated” as long as Taiwan accepts that there is only one China and does not seek independence, is also missing from the latest white paper
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The updated white paper is called “The Taiwan Question and China’s Reunification in the New Era”
