                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 — The High Court here was told today that Tan Sri Shahrir Ab Samad had received RM25,700 in monthly allowances from the Parliamentary Affairs Division when he was a Member of the Dewan Rakyat
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Parliament of Malaysia’s Parliamentary Affairs Division senior assistant administrative officer, Rosli Mat Jinun, 49, said when Shahrir was elected as a Member of the Dewan Rakyat, he received monthly allowance as well as entertainment, telephone, travel, special payment, fixed car driver, petrol and toll allowances

            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Each Member of parliament is eligible to receive the fixed monthly allowances,” he said

                Rosli, who is among others, tasked with managing the payment and termination of allowances for members of Parliament, also confirmed that the allowances were paid by the Parliamentary Affairs Division to Shahrir through the former Johor Baru member of Parliament’s Public Bank account

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Judge Datuk Akhtar Tahir dismissed the application on grounds that there were no special circumstances for the court to grant a stay of execution of the judgment as by  the defendants

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "The grounds of appeal have been filed (by the five defendants) in the Court of Appeal and the problem in the procedure to withdraw money from the Treasury is not a special circumstances," he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the concern by the defendants that the money could not be refunded by the youth if they  won in their appeal at the Court of Appeal was not a special circumstance that justified the court granting a stay of execution of the judgment
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                In submitting a memorandum on the issue to the home ministry, outside the Parliament building, the PKR-backed group said 68% of commercial crimes since May 2020 involved online scams

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                PKR central leadership council member Lee Chean Chung said that the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp in Singapore had given RM44.4 million in goodwill payouts to around 790 scam victims early this year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “There have been cases where the bank was supposed to alert the victim about several irregular transactions, but did not do so because it was a public holiday,” he said at a press conference

                Saying Bank Negara Malaysia’s monitoring of commercial banks was too weak, the group urged the central bank to ensure that financial institutions took more responsibility for financial scams

                "JPSM sees this as a violation of terms, because the Musang King is not a forest plantation species and despite that, there are 5,000 trees planted in an area of 52ha in Gunung Inas," Takiyuddin said during Minister Question Time in Parliament on Tuesday (July 26) morning

                Takiyuddin said the JPSM had proposed to the Kedah government to gazette Gunung Inas as a forest reserve, so that it could act as a water catchment area

                Khairy said that the disruption of supply was due to the total lockdown in China where most of the supply for active ingredients for pharmaceutical products are produced and the Russia-Ukraine war where an ingredient which is added to the active ingredient was produced
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairy (BN-Rembau) added that the ministry has also agreed to release its stockpile to the private sector
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To ensure the country's drug security and self-reliance in times of crisis, local pharmaceutical companies are encouraged to produce their own active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) through public-private partnerships
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In addition to that, Khairy added that the ministry would also advocate pharmaceutical product patency by strengthening its cooperation with the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia to prevent patent ever-greening
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a related note, Khairy said the ministry was looking into the implementation of price control through the price transparency mechanism
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Noting that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a “devastating impact” on the global economy, Salleh said it had resulted in a significant decrease in demand for goods and services in the local market
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Large investments from GLCs can help increase spending and demand, thus increasing the income of households and businesses – as well as generating more tax revenue for the government.” Salleh, who is the Usukan assemblyman, also highlighted the decrease in foreign direct investment during the pandemic

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In March 2021, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) said the country recorded RM13.9 billion in net foreign investment in 2020 – a 56% drop from the RM31.7 billion recorded in 2019
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “There has to be an increase in domestic direct investment to compensate for the lack of foreign direct investment,” said Salleh

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “GLCs can play an important role in this.” He added that investment in sectors that had been badly affected by the pandemic, such as tourism, could help stimulate the sector and prevent some firms from going out of business

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Salleh also said increased domestic investment by GLCs was especially needed considering the government’s limited financial capacity, something, he noted, that was not unique to Malaysia

                I used to worry whether my ex-husband was beating and torturing them like he used to do to me.” It is the latest case in multi-ethnic Malaysia of a so-called “unilateral conversion” to Islam — one parent converting a child’s religion without the other’s permission
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Loh said those who sided with her ex-husband’s decision to convert the children from Hinduism to Islam, and sought to keep them separated from her, were not respecting the top court’s decision
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “They are stopping their children from being with their mother.” Loh has a mixed background, with an ethnic Chinese father and ethnic Indian mother
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While she was recovering from her injuries, Loh claims her husband took the children

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “It is all about power and control.” Loh’s saga is not over, with her lawyers challenging the children’s conversion to Islam in court, arguing it was unconstitutional

                The influential Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party — an Islamist group that forms part of the national government — urged Loh not to challenge the conversion

                Puad Zarkashi said the RoS promised to inform the party on the status of the application by July 16

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If the amendment is approved, Umno will be allowed to postpone its party elections by up to six months after a general election or up to 18 months from the end of its leadership’s term, whichever comes later
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Puad said the RoS had tarnished its credibility by taking so much time on a simple matter  “RoS has no right to dictate an organisation or political party’s constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This is the right of any registered organisation,” he said, adding Umno had followed the book in amending its constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This is not about Umno wanting to postpone polls, this is about Umno amending its constitution

                If other parties can get a response (to their application) within a week, why does Umno have to wait so long

                In a statement last night, the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) confirmed that the wanted Malaysian was currently under the custody of Thai authorities
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, Thai media quoted the country’s national police assistant chief Pol Lt-Gen Surachate Hakparn as saying that Teow, who is also wanted in China and Thailand, was expected to be deported to China today
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the Chinese embassy in Thailand was facilitating the extradition
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “With cooperation from the Malaysian police, we brought the boat back to our shore,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Teow founded the MBI Group and operated entertainment complexes, including a resort in Danok at the Thailand-Malaysia border, as well as built a business empire from online investment schemes attracting investors from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Macau

                In 2018, Malaysian authorities charged Teow with financial crime and his assets were seized for his alleged connection to a pyramid scheme, but he fled to Thailand last year

                Leadership contender says he will close 30 Mandarin teaching programmes to restrain Beijing’s soft power China is the biggest long-term threat to Britain, Rishi Sunak will say on Monday as he unveils plans to curb the country’s soft power by closing all of its 30 Confucius Institutes, which promote the teaching of Chinese language and culture, in the UK

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It said Sunak had a “pragmatic view of developing balanced ties with China”

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In an attempt to move the focus in the Tory leadership race on to national security and international affairs, Sunak is expected to say on Monday that China “is the biggest-long-term threat to Britain and the world’s economic and national security”, citing the views of the director general of MI5 and head of the FBI

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sunak’s remarks on Confucius Institute are likely to contrast with Truss, who oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding between University College London’s education faculty and Hanban – an agency under China’s education ministry that used to be a partner in the scheme – when she was an education minister in 2014

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 — Residents of Desa Sri Hartamas and Segambut MP Hannah Yeoh gathered today to object to a proposed development plan that they say will contribute to the traffic congestion in the area

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The noticeboard also displayed a picture suggesting a high-rise office building and a condominium will be built on the land

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is understood that the proposed development plan involves land with a water sewage facility

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 — Lawyer Gobind Singh Deo today challenged the validity of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) investigation on Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman after an investigator appeared ignorant of basic facts relevant to his fraud trial
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nurul could not recall when she spoke to Syed Saddiq’s father or name the officer who was in charge of speaking to Syed Saddiq during the investigation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She also disagreed with Gobind that during an election, money could be advanced and reimbursed later despite being shown several related payments
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As Gobind maintained the line of questioning, Nurul Hidayah began repeating her previous answers regardless of the question

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During cross examination earlier today, Nurul insisted that RM100,000 from this went from Maybank Islamic Bhd account belonging to Armada Bumi Bersatu Enterprise (ABBE) into Syed Saddiq’s personal bank account in two payments of RM50,000
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Syed Saddiq also faces two counts of engaging in money laundering activities, namely two transactions of RM50,000, believed to be proceeds of unlawful activities, from his Maybank Islamic Bhd account into his Amanah Saham Bumiputera account, on June 16 and 19, 2018
