                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Aug 21 —Singapore will decriminalise sex between men but has no plans to change the legal definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LGBTQ groups welcomed Lee’s decision to repeal Section 377A of the penal code, a colonial-era law that criminalises sex between men, but also expressed concern that ruling out same-sex marriage would help to perpetuate discrimination
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under Singapore’s Section 377A, offenders can be jailed for up to two years under the law, but it is not currently actively enforced
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There have been no known convictions for sex between consenting adult males for decades and the law does not include sex between women or other genders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For those that long for a more equal and inclusive Singapore, repeal signifies that change is indeed possible,” they said in the statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some religious groups including Muslims, Catholics and some Protestants continued to resist any repeal of the law, Lee said

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Aug 21 —Singapore will decriminalise sex between men but has no plans to change the legal definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                LGBTQ groups welcomed Lee’s decision to repeal Section 377A of the penal code, a colonial-era law that criminalises sex between men, but also expressed concern that ruling out same-sex marriage would help to perpetuate discrimination
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under Singapore’s Section 377A, offenders can be jailed for up to two years under the law, but it is not currently actively enforced
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There have been no known convictions for sex between consenting adult males for decades and the law does not include sex between women or other genders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For those that long for a more equal and inclusive Singapore, repeal signifies that change is indeed possible,” they said in the statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some religious groups including Muslims, Catholics and some Protestants continued to resist any repeal of the law, Lee said

                Surely in this day and age, when the world is battling gender inequality, we shouldn’t deny Malaysian mothers the right to confer citizenship on their children who were born abroad, just as Malaysian fathers are allowed to, says the columnist

                The English translation on Wikipedia has it as “My motherland, land of my birth”, while I’ve seen the more passionate “My country that I live and die for”

                It reminds me of the concept of jus soli (the right of the soil), or birthright citizenship, which is the idea that if you are born in a country, you are automatically a citizen of that country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was the principle applied in the early days of Malaya and Malaysia, that if you were born here before a certain date, no matter who your parents were, you were considered a citizen

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 21 — PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Abdul Hadi Awang’s “racist and extremist anti-non-Bumi and anti-non-Muslim rhetoric” blaming them for being the root of corruption is a shrewd strategy designed to strengthen PAS’ electoral prospects in the general election, DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng said

            <p>
                “They then damage our politics as they are the roots for corruption and the majority of them are non-Muslims and non-Bumiputras,” he said in a posting on his Facebook page

            <p>
                By putting a racial and religious slant on corruption with false and baseless claims, Hadi has clearly positioned himself as the principal proponent against non-Bumis and non-Muslims in Malaysia,” Lim added

                When I have time in between meetings or events, I will meet the president at his house," said Ismail Sabri

                The court had set Aug 15 to 19 and Aug 23 to 26 to hear the appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Mohamed Haniff Khatri Abdulla said this is because the court could decide based on the written submissions filed previously by Najib's defence team at the Court of Appeal last year

                The lawyer once again asked the court to postpone the hearing to Thursday (Aug 25) as he has other cases on Tuesday (Aug 23) and Wednesday (Aug 24), but it was rejected by the court as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 16, the court dismissed Hisyam's application to postpone the appeal hearing and ordered the appeal to proceed on Aug 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision and dismissed Najib's appeal to set aside his conviction and jail sentence as well as the fine

                Penang deputy police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Fisol Salleh (second leftt) with other police personnel looking at two motorcycles that have been confiscated at the Southwest District Police Headquarters in Balik Pulau, Penang.

            <p>
                This could happen once the police applies to impose these penalties against negligent parents under Section 33 of the Child Act 2001 in order to hold parents accountable when their underaged children end up as illegal racers, said Penang deputy police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Fisol Salleh

                It is your duty as a parent to know what your children are doing,” he said

            <p>
                The July 17 crash related to illegal racing killed Mohd Haziq Harris, 34, Muhammad Shazwan Hakim Mohd Abdul Sani, 22, Muhammad Eizreel Muhamad Roszaidi, 25, Ahmad Haikal Naif Ahmad Nazrul, 19, and Muhammad Harith Zikri Yusnizar, 17.Another rider who was injured, Muhammad Rahimi Shukor, 19, was discharged from hospital, while Muhammad Shazwan Hafiz Mohd Abdul Sani, 22, was transferred to a private hospital.
