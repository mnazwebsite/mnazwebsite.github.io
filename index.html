                Takahashi Katsuhiko said the success of the festival was due to the “palpable” support of Malaysians for diversity

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Recently I observed very intense discussions regarding the Bon Odori festival in Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Previously, the festival made headlines when religious affairs minister Idris Ahmad reminded Muslims not to take part in the Japanese community’s annual summer festival, claiming that the celebration was “influenced by elements of other religions”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Idris’ statement prompted the Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, to instruct the Selangor Islamic religious department (Jais) to allow the festival to proceed
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The ruler also reportedly asked Idris, Jais, and the Shah Alam City Council (MBSA) officers to attend Bon Odori to “see for themselves” what takes place at the festival

                If one party disagrees, then nothing can be done.” On Aug 3, Zuraida Kamaruddin, PBM’s president-designate, said the party had applied to join BN about three weeks ago

                Therefore, I told her to write a letter to the BN chairman so that the (application) will be considered during the coalition’s meeting.” Mohamad said several other parties were also interested to join the coalition, though they have been told to be part of the Friends of BN grouping first since they did not have elected representatives

                "There is a new normal, or a new status quo, in terms of kind of the military presence that China will have around Taiwan.” The strategy places greater pressure on the US to craft a response that encourages China to pull back without escalating tensions further, like when then-President Bill Clinton sent two aircraft carrier groups into the area during the last Taiwan Strait crisis
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s drills last week were larger and closer to Taiwan than a similar show of force in the mid-1990s

                China "deterred Taiwan independence forces and completely shattered the so-called strait median line,” Meng Xiangqing, a professor at the PLA’s National Defense University in Beijing, told state broadcaster China Central Television

                "But I don’t think they’re going to do anything more.” China’s exercises also demonstrated the risk that any conflict over Taiwan could quickly escalate and shake global supply chains

                Khairy said that when the country is transitioning to the endemic phase, the focus must be on the severity of the cases, which can be seen through the number of deaths and hospital admissions

                He pointed out that the country’s baseline number of cases has increased due to the Omicron BA.5 variant but the situation is under control as long as the number of deaths and hospital admissions remain low

                Agus Rizal Mat Ali, 50, a director of UC Travel Sdn Bhd, was charged with advertising haj package services using the furada visa for the 2022 season on the company’s Facebook page, claiming that he could organise travel for the purpose of pilgrimage to the holy land although the company did not have a valid haj operator licence from Lembaga Tabung Haji

                The charge was framed under Section 27 (1) (b) of the Tabung Haji Act 1995 punishable under Section 27 (2) of the same law, which provides for a maximum fine of RM100,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year or both upon conviction

                Joseph Wu told a press conference in Taipei that Taiwan, which is claimed by China as its own, would not be intimidated even as the drills continued with China often breaching the unofficial median line down the Taiwan Strait

                US President Joe Biden, in his first public comments on the issue since Pelosi's visit, said yesterday he was concerned about China's actions in the region but he was not worried about Taiwan

                He reminded Ahmad Zahid that after his appearance before the PAC on October 25, 2021, as former defence minister together with Datuk Seri Muez Abdul Aziz, secretary-general of the Ministry of Defence, Hansard was sent to him via registered post and he was given seven days to make any corrections

                Besides that, Wong gave an example of how the PAC handles sensitive information, citing the PAC Proceedings related to the Procurement of the Covid-19 Vaccine and its Use Against Malaysians, in which it reached an agreement with Khairy Jamaluddin, then minister of Science, Technology and Information, to remove the procurement price of Covid-19 vaccines from Hansard

                Seberang Perai Utara district police chief Radzi Ahmad said the syndicate sold drugs in the local market and also exported drugs using a courier service

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said police got their break after a weeklong surveillance when they arrested the mastermind and his lover, aged 36 and 32 respectively, by the roadside in Bayan Lepas on the island at 2.30pm last Thursday
            </p>

                “Following that, police raided a house in Taman Bagan, Butterworth, at 4.30pm and arrested the man’s parents, younger brother and sister-in-law

                “We then raided a courier company in Bayan Lepas at 6.30pm and seized 259gm of syabu,” he told a press conference at the district police headquarters here today

                He said police raided the family house again at 11.30pm the same day and confiscated 447 packets of MDMA powder weighing 13kg and 333gm of syabu

                After the PH government collapsed in 2020 and was replaced by Perikatan Nasional, Wee took over as the transport minister and said the project would be reopened for tender, before mocking Loke for not choosing this “cheaper” option

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sutera Auto Sdn Bhd account executive, Rozana Khalid, 43, who was involved in the process of closing the account for the purchase of the vehicle, said that Shahrir made full payment for the white car, using a cheque, on December 21, 2013
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The seventh prosecution witness also confirmed the copy of the cheque worth RM118,485 and the payment receipt, shown by deputy public prosecutor Rasyidah Murni Azmi
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During the examination-in-chief by Rasyidah Murni regarding the meaning of cash payment, the seventh prosecution witness said that there are three ways of cash payment, namely cash, credit card and cheque
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Rozana said that the probability for a person to buy a car in cash is only one or two per cent
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For example, out of 50 units of cars sold, maybe two or three people will buy in cash and the payment will be made either in the form of cash or credit card,” said Rohana, who has served the company for 13 years

                Shahrir, 72, was charged with money laundering, by not stating his real income in the Income Tax Return Form for Assessment Year 2013, which is a violation of Section 113(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1967, on the RM1 million, believed to be from unlawful activities, which he received from Najib through a cheque

                Malaysiakini yesterday quoted an unnamed Bersatu source saying Azmin is Bersatu’s only nominee for the role

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last week, The Star reported that the Bersatu-led Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition might pull its support for Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, which could trigger the collapse of the federal government

                The matter in question in the suit is an allegation by Muhyiddin that Ahmad Zahid sought his help to intervene in certain court cases

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Justice Rozana Ali Yusoff said this in her dismissal of Ahmad Zahid's injunction application against Muhyiddin during an online proceeding here on Monday (Aug 8)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court dismissed the application with RM5,000 in costs

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In today's proceedings, the court heard the plaintiff's (Ahmad Zahid) application for an interim injunction against the defendant

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Bagan Datuk MP claimed that Muhyiddin’s statement implied that he had used a shortcut to settle and postpone his ongoing court cases, that he had asked for Muhyiddin’s help to intervene in the court cases and the judiciary system, to order the dissolution of the Johor State Assembly and also implied that he was not a respectable and exemplary leader

                Muhyiddin claimed that when he heard the plaintiff’s request, he told the latter that he could not and would not interfere with the court proceedings and advised the plaintiff to defend himself in court if he was truly innocent
