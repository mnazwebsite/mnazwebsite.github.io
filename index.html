                At a press conference in Parliament, Wong said when the PAC presented its report on the AES on Nov 23 last year, its first recommendation was that a “Top Secret” report on the matter by the committee on governance, procurement and finance investigation (JKSTUPKK), a body under the PMD, be declassified
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, he said the PMD failed to declassify the report when attending proceedings on the transport ministry’s follow-up action on March 23
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that while the JKSTUPKK report was only declassified on July 8, information such as names of companies, their shareholders, and ministers involved in the AES project was redacted
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This proves that the government, especially the prime minister’s department, does not respect the institution of Parliament and the PAC

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The report, attached together with the PAC’s report on follow-up action by the transport ministry regarding the AES, was presented in Parliament today

                “Malaysia is actively involved in the working group discussions to ensure the interests of developing economies such as Malaysia are not left out of the policies made by OECD,” Nizom told reporters after officiating the Third Malaysia Tax Policy Forum here today

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the implementation of the tax system is to make sure business entities pay their taxes fairly to the host countries and avoid tax leakages

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The LHDN is also monitoring the MNCs operating in Malaysia and local companies operating in foreign countries to identify whether there is any occurrence of transfer pricing

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                He also said it was disappointing that the courts appeared to have not read the 1878 agreement signed by then Sulu Sultan Jamal Al Alam
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                So, in the absence of the arbitration agreement, the arbitration process should have not started in Spain
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, last September, the French Arbitration court, without knowing the decision of the Madrid Court to cancel Stampa's appointment as an arbitrator, went ahead with the Sulu descendants' case against Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last month, it was reported that bailiffs in Luxembourg had seized Luxembourg-registered subsidiaries Petronas Azerbaijian (Shah Deniz) and Petronas South Caucasus on behalf of the Sulu claimants

                Earlier during the morning session, Cha Kee Chin (PH-Rasah) pointed out mistakes in the Malay language copy of the Bill, accusing the attorney-general of failing to heed Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s request to uphold the Malay language

                “I want to give some advice, maybe not to Mafi, but to the AGC because I see in the Malay version of the amendment, under Schedule 3 which lists all six livestock should be written in Malay
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The AGC, apparently, is not upholding what the prime minister has outlined, which was about our national language, and in the House, it is our responsibility to lift the national language together,” he told the Dewan Rakyat

                The application was filed on March 25, 2022, with the Perlis State Registrar of Converts, Perlis Islamic Religious and Malay Customs Council (MAIPs), Perlis Mufti Datuk Dr Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin and the Perlis state government named as the first to the fourth respondent

                She also sought a certiorari order to revoke the Declaration of Conversion to Islam, dated July 7, 2020, issued by the Registrar of Converts of Perlis in the name of her three children, and also other cards on their conversion to Islam that have been issued by other parties, and also prevent any party from issuing such a card

                Rafick said the traffic impact assessment for the East Klang Valley Expressway had been conducted during a festive season which would have skewed the results

                Be open and work together with the community,” he said, adding that highway proponents and the Malaysia Highway Authority (LLM) had been reluctant in providing pertinent feedback upon request

                “Just don’t simply grant them (contractors) the leeway to mould and finalise the alignment, decide on the highway design and land use according to their preference.” The Kuala Lumpur Northern Dispersal Expressway (or KL Node) is the final portion of the Kuala Lumpur Outer Ring Road project

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rafick said KL Node must be directly connected to the EKVE and the Kuala Lumpur-Kuala Selangor highway (or Latar expressway) instead of allowing traffic to spill over to local roads upon exit points

                “If this is not addressed, it will be a repeat of the bottleneck, like the seven-lane situation in which the Duke Highway egress combines with roads and exits into mixed development, merging into the three-lane Middle Ring Road 2,” he said

                “Did he not read the (MoU) in full, or is he not understanding it on purpose due to certain reasons?” Fahmi said the MoU, signed between Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Pakatan Harapan (PH) leaders last year, said it would remain in effect until the day Parliament is dissolved

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The MoU also stated the government agreed not to propose dissolution of Parliament before July 31, Fahmi said

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nur Jazlan had said in a Facebook posting today that July 31 was the last day of the agreement

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Fahmi said the MoU stated that the agreement would not affect the opposition’s role in providing checks and balances on the government as well as ensuring that Putrajaya will be accountable to the Parliament and to the rakyat

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, July 31 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob today said that Barisan Nasional (BN) can’t assume they have the public’s support just because there are people who are dissatisfied with Pakatan Harapan (PH)

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During the Selangor BN Convention today, Ismail Sabri asked the state branch’s women’s wing, Wanita Selangor, to conduct a voter attitude study in order to have some "supporting facts” when preparing the party's general election strategy

            <p> </p>

                "Now people are comparing us with Pakatan Harapan (PH) and saying they don’t trust in PH anymore to give them a second chance,” he said during the event held in Setia City Convention Centre, Shah Alam today

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "I am afraid that if we don’t do a proper study, then [if we have an election] like in Johor and Melaka, they [voters] end up not coming out to vote

                So Sabah can finally get off the tag of the ‘state of political frogs’

                “It is puzzling and bizarre that we as one of the major victims of the political frog culture are not responding to this, what’s the Sabah government’s stance? This should be answered immediately as we do not want a wrong perception that Sabah is not in favour to end the political hopping culture,” said Phoong in a statement on Saturday

                He said the anti-hopping law is actually beneficial for Sabah’s political stability as both GRS and BN do not have simple majority in the state assembly as an individual coalition, this could prevent further political turmoil in Sabah

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Phoong urged all main political parties in the Sabah State Assembly to declare their stance towards the bill

                If the Malaysian property market suffered, he added, it would be due to the country’s own problems rather than the downturn in China’s real estate

                “Malaysia needs to look inwards as to how we deal with all these other issues such as the ‘super inflation’ and the complications arising out of the Russia-Ukraine war, instead of focusing just on what is brewing in China,” he told FMT

                On July 15, Bloomberg reported that China’s real estate slump, which began in 2021 with curbs on mortgages and funding for property developers, would damage the Chinese economy, and effects would be felt by the rest of the world

                Siva said Putrajaya would need to keep an ear on the ground should things take a turn for the worse, adding that “if China sneezes, Malaysia will also catch a cold”

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Real estate veteran Ernest Cheong told FMT that only those projects funded by Chinese investors would grapple with completion problems as China tightened its purse strings

                However, other government-backed projects in Malaysia carried out by Chinese companies would go on so long as the government continued to fund them, he said

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 — Touristic area, Jalan Pudu in Kuala Lumpur now has a new colourful mural by Poesy Liang
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The 105ft x 35ft mural, titled the Rooftop Cat is on a private building located next to Lalaport Bukit Bintang City Centre
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “However I completely forgot to factor in weather conditions and thunderstorms turned the whole production upside down.”   Speaking about the artwork, Liang said the Rooftop Cat is her signature art and is about great aspirations and leadership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “From the highest vantage point, the cat might attempt to balance uncomfortably at the pinnacle of a roof risking his life, but as the saying goes, a cat has nine lives.” The Rooftop Cat artwork has a personal story for Liang that dates back to 2011
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to her, she started drawing the Rooftop Cat in September 2011 after the world tour of social movement Bald Empathy Movement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I was financially strapped to make repairs due to medical bills.” Liang said when her rooftop collapsed, a tiny tuxedo cat appeared with his funny antics and distracted her from taking her own life
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “From that point on, Harry Putter was drawn into the Rooftop Cat and his character began to develop in song, poetry and other mediums.”

                Umno simply is not capable of reprimanding itself

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                And that is the reason Umno and PAS "hate" the DAP - because they cannot bully the DAP

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For me, the end of the MoU signifies that the government is free from the shackles of an Opposition that is smart enough to manipulate it for its own political benefit

                “The period of the MoU was supposedly for a political ceasefire, but the Opposition was more fervent in criticising the government that is led by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the other hand, at the end of the MoU, they demanded Ismail Sabri and the government fulfil all the demands in the MoU

                To the point that the president of PKR and his colleagues in PH want to meet Ismail Sabri to make the claim that some parts of the MoU have not been met by the government

                “This law is among the top institutional reforms that Malaysia must undertake to restore domestic and international confidence in the parliamentary democracy practised in Malaysia.” Ten days ago, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Political Financing had also submitted a motion to table a private bill on political funding to Parliament

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The bill, according to G25, was aimed at stopping the unethical and corrupt practice of political donations to Malaysian politicians, including those made by foreign donors

                On July 25, Ultra Kirana Sdn Bhd’s former administrative manager David Tan revealed during Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi’s corruption trial that it had made millions of ringgit in political donations to several politicians, notably to Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan, former transport minister Chan Kong Choy and former international trade and industry minister Ong Ka Chuan
