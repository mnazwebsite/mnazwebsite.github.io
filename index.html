                “That’s hilarious!” Najib responded in a Facebook post

                However, Najib did not respond to a threat by Rafizi that he would divulge details of shell companies used to launder money from the RM9 billion littoral combat ship project, which entails the construction of six corvette-class ships for the navy

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the finance ministry under PH had wanted to sell a 28-storey office tower in Hong Kong belonging to China Evergrande Group for RM1.6 billion, and had held talks to sell a 60% stake in the Bandar Malaysia mixed commercial project for RM7.41 billion to property developer Iskandar Waterfront Holdings and China Railway Engineering Corp

                The LCS project was the subject of a report by Parliament’s watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee, which said that not a single ship had been completed despite RM6 billion being spent since 2011

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Over the past month, some Bersatu leaders had been pressing Ismail to honour his promise to elect a deputy prime minister from the party, as was previously agreed when Bersatu decided to support Ismail’s appointment as prime minister
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Wasn’t there a promise with PH, in which Bersatu was a component, for Dr Mahathir Mohamad to be prime minister for two years, after which the position would be handed over to Anwar Ibrahim?” he said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “That was a clear breach of promise too.” Similarly, Hassan pointed to Hamzah’s collusion with Mahathir to organise the Malay Dignity Congress in 2019, calling it part of the efforts to derail Anwar’s promised premiership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the end, he said, it was Muhyiddin who became prime minister instead of Anwar
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “For them to now accuse Ismail of forgetting his promise, well it’s clearly a case of the pot calling the kettle black,” Hassan said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Ismail had cleverly countered Bersatu’s threats not to support his administration by stating that a general election (GE15) must be held if that happens
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, Aug 7 — Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg today stressed that the state government will protect non-Muslims and care for them to achieve togetherness and inclusion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said as an example the Sarawak government has channeled aid to non-Muslims through the Unit for Other Religions (UNIFOR) on the basis that non-Muslims also need the protection and care of the state government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the state government has also provided an allocation of RM70 million to build UNIFOR Building in Jalan Ong Tiang Swee, Kuching, so that its administration is more organised and the implementation of religious activities under UNIFOR is more orderly
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I am confident and believe that togetherness in terms of religious development between the Muslim and non-Muslim communities in Sarawak will give birth to a society that is friendly to each other and avoids prejudices that can cause division,” the premier said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said as the head of the state government who is a Muslim, he has always insisted that the “Charter of Medina” is a very suitable guide to guarantee fair administration for the multi-ethnic and multi-religious communities in Sarawak
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Abang Johari said in Sarawak, with the high spirit of understanding and unity that has been built over the years a multi-ethnic and religious community of small Keluarga Sarawak under the auspices of a large Keluarga Malaysia has been established

                He, however, said if there is any collaboration, that would only happen after the next general election

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Loke said collaboration between parties from different divides is more likely to happen since the 2018 general election when the country’s political landscape faced drastic changes, particularly the absence of a single dominant party

                On DAP’s stand regarding the prime minister candidate, Loke said the party was firmly behind Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, though the Seremban MP did not rule out the need for compromise if no party had a clear majority after the 15th general election

                When asked about the trial of DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng on whether corruption charges would affect the party’s chances at GE15, Loke said he did not believe it would

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “We do not think that that particular case will damage the party’s image,” he said indicating that the party trusts Lim and is confident of Lim’s integrity

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry said two agreements or conventions have been signed, namely the Treaty on Principle Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, 1967 (OST 1967) and Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space, 1968 (ARRA 1968)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It also said that Malaysia’s membership in the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN Copuos) since 1994 shows the country's commitment to carrying out its responsibilities in the space sector at the international level
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Malaysia’s commitment has been proven through the gazettement of the Malaysian Space Board Act 2022 (Act 834) on Jan 25, 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "With the existence of Act 834, it allows the government, through the ministry, to consider the necessary actions to ratify all international agreements or conventions related to space in line with the country's priorities and interests,” it said
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It added that three more international agreements or conventions related to space that have yet to be signed are the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 1972 (LIAB 1972); Convention of Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, 1975 (REG 1975) and Agreement Governing the Activities of State on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, 1979 (MOON 1979).- Bernama

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a statement today, Shahrizat said that the Court of Appeal's decision reinforcing that Malaysian women cannot confer citizenship is devastating for Malaysian women
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In this case, the Malaysian government had appealed against the High Court's September 9, 2021 decision, which recognised that Malaysia’s citizenship laws discriminated against women and which had ruled that Malaysian mothers whose children are born overseas should also be entitled to Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While waiting for the Court of Appeal to decide on the appeal, the six Malaysian mothers who filed the suit managed to obtain citizenship documents from the National Registration Department (NRD) for their overseas-born children
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This was because the High Court and Court of Appeal refused to allow the government to defer issuing the citizenship papers while waiting for the appeal to be decided
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After the decision on Friday, lawyer for the six Malaysian mothers, Datuk Gurdial Singh Nijar informed the Court of Appeal that his clients would be appealing to the Federal Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Court of Appeal however, ruled that status quo should be maintained for the overseas-born children of the six Malaysian mothers who had obtained the Malaysian citizenship papers, until the Federal Court decides on their appeal

                “They are the group we hope to target, and we will also carry out other efforts to attract non-Malay support for Bersatu and Perikatan Nasional (PN).” The former Pemanis assemblyman was asked about the wing’s efforts to attract non-Malay support for Bersatu after the resignation of Segamat MP Edmund Santhara Kumar as the head of the party’s associate wing

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked why non-Malays should join Bersatu when the party is spearheaded by one race only, Chong said that the wing he leads does not fight for race-based issues alone
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Bersatu’s associate wing is more about diversity of issues as opposed to becoming a ‘champion’ fighting for race and racial issues,” said Chong

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Bersatu president Muhyiddin Yassin accepted Santhara’s resignation as the party’s associate wing chairman on July 28

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Santhara will, however, remain a Bersatu member and continue to back Muhyiddin’s leadership, a source told FMT

                Many of these highly regarded convent schools were built over 100 years ago, with the first IJS school as well as orphanage set up in Light Street, George Town, in 1852

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a rare interview, Sister Mary Theresa Chua, the Provincial of the IJS – which is legally known as the Lady Superior of the Society of Saint Maur – says the estimated RM3mil annual grants from the Education Ministry (MOE) for all 56 schools would only be enough for basic maintenance, working out to around “RM50,000 to RM70,000 for each school’’
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The site borders the Kuala Lumpur Forest Eco Park, and Sister Theresa fears that the ongoing wet spell and the year-end rainy season would be a problem

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 2020, a landslip also hit the school, which was established in 1899, after heavy rain caused a near collapse of a retaining wall

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sister Theresa describes the plight of convent schools in Malaysia, which have produced hundreds of thousands of students including prominent figures, as desperate

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sister Theresa says there is an urgent need for the MOE to meet Mission school authorities to talk about critical building issues, such as, for example, electrical appliances like airconditioners, computers and projectors that have led to capacity overload

                Police said former sport and youth minister Roy Suryo's arrest was aimed at preventing him from removing any evidence

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Former sport and youth minister Roy Suryo's arrest, which included the seizure of his Twitter account and mobile phone, was aimed at preventing him from removing any evidence, said police spokesperson Endra Zulpan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Investigators decided to detain Roy Suryo Notodiprojo starting tonight as a suspect in a hate speech case," Zulpan told reporters at a press conference on Friday (Aug 5)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Suryo commented at the time that the edited pictures of the leader's face on a statue at the Unesco World Heritage Site were "funny"
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A Buddhist organisation and a Buddhist man filed separate police reports seeking his arrest

                Suryo, however, is not currently facing charges under that law.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 6 — The statement by Prime Minister’s Special Envoy to China Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing on US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s controversial visit to Taiwan does not reflect the Foreign Ministry’s stand, said Datuk Seri Saifuddin Abdullah

                Local media reported that Tiong in a statement yesterday had condemned Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan as it had added fuel to instability in the region

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was reported saying that Pelosi’s visit was a violation of the One China principle and the Three Joint Communiqués that underline the establishment of relations between the US and China

                Tensions between China and the United States heightened after Pelosi arrived in Taiwan on Tuesday
