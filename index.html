                Lawyers for Animal Rights spokesman Rajesh Nagarajan says it has sent a letter of demand (LOD) calling on MPK to take disciplinary action and the DVS to charge the perpetrators under Section 29 of the Animal Welfare Act 2015

                “If they have not done that, then they have failed in their duties, and action should be taken against MPK by the Selangor state government.” “Why is it that until now we haven’t got any statement from the MPK, the Animal Welfare Board (AWB), the Selangor state government and DVS?” The press conference this evening also saw two witnesses, known only as Sahana and Nithyah, sharing their account of the incident which saw more than one dog being hauled up by MPK

                Moreover, Sithambaram further argued that it was irrational for Najib to allege that Mohd Nazlan’s past employment with Maybank Group was a fact recently discovered or deliberately suppressed from him since they were known in the public domain
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said information of Mohd Nazlan’s previous appointment with Maybank Group became the centre of attention in August 2018, before the commencement of the trial, when the news that Mohd Nazlan was to preside over the trial was being widely reported in the media
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “My Lady, before the commencement of the trial, everyone knew Justice Nazlan was from Maybank
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They knew that,” he said, adding that even Najib’s own affidavit in support had disclosed Mohd Nazlan’s role in the financial institution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib’s first counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah previously claimed on June 7 that Mohd Nazlan had failed to disclose his position in Maybank Group, which was responsible for proposing the establishment of SRC International
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his supporting affidavit, Najib said the evidence he sought to adduce was not made available to him at trial, adding that the evidence was relevant to the issues before the High Court and Court of Appeal and thus would be relevant to his appeals that would be adjudicated in the Federal Court

                The project value is (circa) RM9 billion for six ships (LCS), so the cost for one ship is about RM1.5 billion, so with RM6 billion being spent, you would expect at least four to be built … but no, not even one
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                From the PAC report, it is understood that BNS had made additional claims which would have driven up the price of the six vessels to an astronomical RM11.14 billion, or RM1.86 billion per LCS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Until 2014, the government had forked out RM5 billion to BNS, out of which RM1.02 billion was deemed a “mobilisation payment”, which many say is huge for a project of this size
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This bit of history is relevant to what is going on now with the LCS because of the RM6.08 billion paid by the government for the RM9.13 billion contract, RM1.4 billion was not utilised for the project at all, RM1 billion was termed a cost overrun, and RM400 million was used to settle PSCI’s debts
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Strangely, BNS had total assets of RM1.51 billion, with total liabilities also pegged at RM1.51 billion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                BNS is also said to have been actively acquiring equipment and had amassed RM1.7 billion worth in its stores

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail Sabri, Malaysia’s ninth prime minister, also has suggested that Bahasa Melayu be made Asan's second official language
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Universiti Teknologi Malaysia geostrategist Prof Dr Azmi Hassan and international affairs analyst Associate Prof Dr Roy Anthony Rogers Peter Rogers told Bernama that Ismail Sabri’s effort to use the national language at international events should be appreciated
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "It is difficult for Malaysia as a small country to present this concept, but our foreign policy is in line with the concept of the Malaysian Family and 'World Family'," said Prof Azmi
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The World Family concept is the larger extension of Ismail Sabri’s Malaysian Family ideal that he introduced in his inaugural speech when he took over the country’s leadership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail Sabri has highlighted the concept at international conferences including during the 76th UNGA in September 2021
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At the regional level, particularly at the Asean level, Ismail Sabri has voiced Malaysia's steadfast position on the crisis in Myanmar since the Feb 1 (2021) coup, and the Rohingya refugee issue where Malaysia is hosting up to 200,000 of the refugees

                Love you mum and dad, now and forever." Aloysius Fong repeated these sentiments in Newcastle Crown Court on Friday (Aug 12) before his father was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder

                Najib’s lead defence counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah has requested from High Court judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah an adjournment of at least two weeks because the final appeal in the SRC trial in the Federal Court is scheduled to take place until Aug 26

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The other four companies — Celcom, DiGi, YTL and Telekom Malaysia — agreed earlier to take up shares in DNB that were offered to them by the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also pointed out that while the six Malaysian telcos have agreed to take up shares in DNB, a full completion of the deal can only happen once they agree to the access terms by August 31
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But the stakes are contingent on the former companies agreeing access terms with DNB
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                DNB was established in early March 2021 to accelerate deployment of 5G infrastructure and network in Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It will offer 5G as a wholesale network service to other telcos.

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was clear from the testimony by Abdul Aziz, 66, that he made the decision because many of the actions by Boustead Naval Shipyard (BNS), a unit of BHIC, was allegedly against the interest of the navy
            </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Abdul Aziz’s main grievance was RMN’s objection to the design of the ships as he felt the navy, as the end user, should have a say but his views were ignored by the contractor, BHIC, which was supposed to build the six LCS
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                BUSINESS owners and workers in Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman are divided over Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s (DBKL) plan to close the busy road to traffic every Sunday

                Textile shop worker Hartina Lanivi, 32, welcomed the plan to turn part of Jalan TAR into a pedestrian zone, but was against allowing buskers to perform along the two-lane road

                Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz is confident that Malaysia will have positive economic growth at least until the third quarter of this year and emphasised that the country must be prepared for a slowdown in the global economy

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier this month, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said that Malaysia will find it a challenge to avoid an economic recession next year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nevertheless, Tengku Zafrul is confident that Malaysia will have positive economic growth at least until the third quarter of this year and emphasised that the country must be prepared for a slowdown in the global economy

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Malaysia blindly followed the anti-scientific world trend and now finds itself sharing that same fate.” Ferlito said Malaysia’s economic recovery so far has been driven by private consumption and government spending
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “For the future, I expect Malaysia’s economic growth to be even more fragile, as government spending will have to slow down if we want to seriously tackle inflation.” Ferlito said inflation may slow down private consumption and that external trade may suffer due to the global uncertainties

                Malaysia’s economy grew 8.9% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2022, driven mainly by the continued pick-up in domestic economic activities following further reopening of the economy, as well as international borders

                A health worker inoculates a woman with a dose of the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine during a mass vaccination at a zoo in Surabaya on September 13, 2021

                He explained that in December of last year, roughly 30% of Indonesia's targeted 208 million population had not received Covid-19 vaccines, while last month only some 18% had not been inoculated

                As of Friday, more than 202 million Indonesians had received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines, some 170.4 million had been jabbed with a second dose and around 58.2 million had received a third shot

                Pandu said the highest increase in antibody titer was observed among respondents who had received a booster dose, with an average of 4,496 units per millilitre

                Indonesia’s monthly vaccine rollout has been decreasing significantly since March of this year, with the government attributing the slowdown to increasing vaccine hesitancy among the public due to the improving Covid-19 situation

                The government managed to increase its vaccine rollout to around 7.7 million doses after the mandatory booster regulation was in place, however, average daily vaccinations still hover at around 250,000 per day, much lower than the around one million shots administered per day achieved earlier this year

                Lorry driver Saffri Kamaruddin, 50, admitted that his EPF savings would not be enough to sustain him after retirement in view of the rising cost of living

                A factory worker, known as Krishnan, 55, said he has increased his monthly contribution to EPF to ensure his savings will be enough when he retires

                Meanwhile, a consultant at an aviation school, Zulfadli Halim, 50, said that the hike in the cost of living has made it difficult for him to increase his monthly contribution to EPF and he was worried about his future

                “EPF members’ savings are at a low and very worrying level, especially after the four withdrawals and the reduction in the employee share of the statutory contribution rate,” he said, adding that as of June 30, 6.62 million members — or 52% of the total of 12.78 million EPF members aged under 55 — had savings of less than RM10,000
