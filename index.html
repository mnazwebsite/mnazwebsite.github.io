                In a brief statement, police secretary Noorsiah Saaduddin said that Bukit Aman’s classified investigation unit (D5) will be recording Apandi’s statement at 2.30pm

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Azimah said this in her judgment when dismissing the defamation suit filed by Apandi against Lim

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On July 29, MalaysiaNow reported Apandi as saying that he would cooperate with the police in their investigation following the reports lodged against him

                He was in the spotlight again recently after he was reported to have acted as a “middleman” in talks between the government and fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low

                On July 16, Apandi was reported by The Malaysian Insight as saying that he had arranged meetings between the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) and Low’s representatives at the end of May

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Apandi had since been asked to explain himself over his roles in arranging these meetings by several parties, notably former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, former finance minister Lim Guan Eng and Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh

                Muhyiddin, who is also Perikatan Nasional (PN) chairman, was forced to step down after some 11 MPs from Umno withdrew their support for him

                At a press conference after his speech at the Selangor Barisan convention, Najib said that while it would be a tough battle ahead, it was possible to convince voters to vote for Barisan in Selangor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But we have a fighting chance to create the state government here and that hope is enough," he said at the Setia Convention Centre here on Sunday (July 31)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "We have to explain to the Selangor people that the successes that made Selangor an industrial and successful state is due to the efforts made by Barisan," said Najib

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saying that Barisan was "tired" of being the opposition in Selangor, Najib pointed out that the Pakatan-led state government had not shown good progress despite governing the state since 2008

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 — Tobacco manufacturers in Malaysia are unhappy with the proposed Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Act 2022, arguing that it gave too much power to authorities and will cause a breach of basic human rights

            <p> </p>

                “In the end, instead of creating a smoke-free generation, we are creating a generation of criminals who are being punished for buying a product others can buy,” the group said in a statement today
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Bill, which was tabled for its first reading by Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin last Wednesday, provides for, among others, the prohibition of smoking, buying or possessing tobacco products or smoking devices by the Generational End-Game (GEG) or individuals, born in 2007 onwards
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The punishments provided in the Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022 states there will be no criminal record for GEG offenders, and they will only be fined, if convicted
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to Section 17 of the proposed act, no person who was born on January 1, 2007 onwards shall smoke any tobacco product or substitute tobacco product; use any smoking device; or possess any tobacco product, smoking substance, substitute tobacco product or smoking device
            </p>

                US Space Command said the Long March 5B rocket re-entered over the Indian Ocean at approximately 12.45pm EDT Saturday, but referred questions about “reentry’s technical aspects such as potential debris dispersal impact location” to China

                “Doing so is critical to the responsible use of space and to ensure the safety of people here on earth.” Social media users in Malaysia posted videos of what appeared to be rocket debris

                The Long March 5B blasted off July 24 to deliver a laboratory module to the new Chinese space station under construction in orbit, marking the third flight of China’s most powerful rocket since its maiden launch in 2020

                Last year, Nasa and others accused China of being opaque after the Beijing government kept silent about the estimated debris trajectory or the reentry window of its last Long March rocket flight in May 2021

                If the Malaysian property market suffered, he added, it would be due to the country’s own problems rather than the downturn in China’s real estate

                “Malaysia needs to look inwards as to how we deal with all these other issues such as the ‘super inflation’ and the complications arising out of the Russia-Ukraine war, instead of focusing just on what is brewing in China,” he told FMT

                On July 15, Bloomberg reported that China’s real estate slump, which began in 2021 with curbs on mortgages and funding for property developers, would damage the Chinese economy, and effects would be felt by the rest of the world

                This is in contrast to the regular southwest monsoon season that occurs from May till September yearly, which is generally drier and hotter in Malaysia and its neighbouring countries, as explained in the Northeast Monsoon Report released by MetMalaysia in May

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The weather can become quite humid due to the monsoon break in which the south-west winds of the country become weak and occasionally multi-directional, resulting in the increased formation of thunderstorm clouds that can last from the afternoon until the night

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “MetMalaysia predicts that there will not be a prolonged period of days without rain and the country is expected to experience this kind of situation alternately throughout the southwest monsoon this year,” said MetMalaysia director-general Muhammad Helmi Abdullah when asked about the drastic change in the weather recently

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The country is currently receiving consistent westerly winds and the resulting squall line phenomenon that carries straight-line winds can cause thunderstorm weather conditions in the early morning especially in the waters of the Malacca Strait, the west coast of the peninsula and west Sabah

                “The country is still affected by the La Nina phenomenon that has a 62%-66% chance of continuing until December, thus affecting the southwest monsoon in the region which should cause the number of days without rain to decrease in most areas of our country,” he said

                Sultan Nazrin added that the country was the ninth largest importer of rice, importing around US$620mil (RM2.7bil) worth of rice in 2020
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The nearly three years that we have been affected by Covid-19 highlights the critical status of the lack of food supply in the country to the point that we have needed help from other countries to ensure we have enough food,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sultan Nazrin also said statistics in 2020 showed that 5.3 million hectares of land in the country comprised agricultural land
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “However, based on commercial estimates, only 900,000ha or 17% are used to produce food
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The culture of having every household produce one type of food crop should be instilled,” Sultan Nazrin said, adding that it was time to create a new generation of farmers, expand food crop areas and encourage production through modern methods, even on small pieces of land
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also lauded the Perak Islamic Religion and Malay Customs Council and the Perak Islamic Religious Department for working with the Agriculture Department in producing food, which he described as an “out-of-the-box” and strategic move

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On January 14, 2020, the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak granted all nine court orders sought by Malaysia, including declarations that there is no arbitration agreement in the 1878 document or between Malaysia and the eight; declarations that Malaysia did not waive its sovereign immunity to confer jurisdiction for the Madrid court to appoint Stampa as arbitrator and that he has no jurisdiction over the sovereign state of Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court in Sabah also granted Malaysia injunctions to stop the eight claimants from continuing the arbitration in Spain and to stop them from enforcing awards made in the Spanish arbitration
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia asked the High Court in Madrid to enforce the High Court’s January 2020 decision in Sabah, which said the Spanish arbitration should stop
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia continued trying to stop the arbitration

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Despite the Paris Court of Appeal’s court order which would effectively have required the arbitration to stop, Stampa rejected Malaysia’s December 17, 2021 request to immediately stop the arbitration by December 20, 2021

                Mohd Jafni defended the abrupt decision by the state government in shortening the councillors’ term of service, which was slated to end only on Dec 31, as necessary
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last week, Kulai Municipal Council (MPKu) president Natazha Hariss said during its full council meeting that the government had agreed to end the term of all local councillors following a state executive council meeting on July 19
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Johor Bersatu information chief Mohd Solihan Badri, when contacted, said he was unaware of the state government’s decision, but added that it was its right as the ruling coalition to do so
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                His party previously had representatives at all local councils

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The state government should have allowed the councillors’ term to end naturally by the end of this year as many of Bersatu’s councillors worked hard in serving the people despite having been treated unfairly since the state election (in March),” he said.

                The students were from different states across the country but share a common love for anime and decided to check out the Bon Odori for the first time

                “Malaysia needs to look inwards as to how we deal with all these other issues such as the ‘super inflation’ and the complications arising out of the Russia-Ukraine war, instead of focusing just on what is brewing in China,” he told FMT

                On July 15, Bloomberg reported that China’s real estate slump, which began in 2021 with curbs on mortgages and funding for property developers, would damage the Chinese economy, and effects would be felt by the rest of the world

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Real estate veteran Ernest Cheong told FMT that only those projects funded by Chinese investors would grapple with completion problems as China tightened its purse strings

                “So, I think the basis for the government to make a decision (on a targeted subsidy scheme) is very strong for a higher percentage to reach the target group (B40),” he said here after a meeting with Terengganu fishermen

                Fire and Rescue chief for Kota Kinabatangan Nurul Azlan Shah Jamalludin said based on information gathered from the victim’s family, the crocodile had snatched her and swam away very quickly

                Save the Portuguese action committee chairman Martin Theseira said anecdotal and imaginary pieces should not be used to rename a historic site
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Sadly, the move to rename St Paul Hill is seen as politically motivated and not based on authentic history

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "My community wouldn't object to the renaming of the hill if it is based on the actual Melaka history," he said when interviewed on Saturday (July 30)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Theseira said he will continue to demand for professional findings on the history of the hill before the state government erects any signboards to rename the site

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Theseira said recovering the relics would also back the move to change the name of St Paul Hill to Bukit Melaka

                Theseira was commenting on the move to change the name of St Paul Hill to Bukit Melaka that was confirmed in a written answer to Bandar Hilir assemblyman Lau Chau Yen during the state legislative assembly that ended on July 27.

                In a Facebook post on Friday night (July 29), GISTDA said there is still a small chance that some debris may land here because Thailand is in the rocket’s orbit path
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The massive 21-tonne booster, part of the Long March 5B rocket that was launched by China on July 24, may result in masses of debris even after most of it burns in space
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                GISTDA said it has been using the Space Traffic Management System or Zircon to analyse the situation and has urged people to monitor updates even though the chance of the debris hitting Thailand is quite low
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                It said it was wrong to compare the RM600 “presumed work value” of housewives under the Housewives’ Social Security Bill 2022 (SKSSR) with the RM1,500 minimum wage for workers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If the ‘presumed work value’ is revised to match the RM1,500 minimum wage, then the contribution rate would increase to RM418.80 a year or RM34.90 per month,” said Socso’s chief communications and corporate affairs officer Izad Raya, in a statement issued today

                Perkeso was responding to an FMT report earlier in which several women’s rights groups criticised the government’s RM600 “presumed work value” of a housewife, saying it did not reflect the amount of work she does
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Monday, the bill came under fire while being debated in the Dewan Rakyat due to a clause that mentions RM600 as the “presumed work value” of a housewife
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yeoh, who is a former deputy women, family and community development minister, also said if RM600 was seen as the presumed monthly income rate, then a housewife would only be earning RM20 per day

                Energy and natural resources minister Takiyuddin Hassan said about one million domestic, industrial and commercial account users were affected by the power outage that occurred at 12.39pm on that day

                According to TNB, the disruption that occurred in several areas in Peninsular Malaysia was caused by an equipment failure at the Yong Peng north main input substation in Yong Peng, Johor

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Saturday (July 30), at the Road March 2022 programme, in conjunction with 215th Police Day celebrations at Dataran Merdeka, people started lining up as early as 7am, even though the counters only opened at 9am
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Abu Kassim Karim, in his 40s, said he chose to pay the summonses at Dataran Merdeka despite the long queue, as he could enjoy some savings by doing so
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It's worth it,” he said when interviewed by Bernama here Saturday
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, the police, in a post on its official Facebook and Twitter accounts, announced that a 50% discount for selected traffic offences would be given to members of the public who make payment at the celebration

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the relaxation, which is aimed at simplifying the entry procedure for travellers to Malaysia, was decided due to the current state of the health system, which is at a good and controlled level
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "The Health Ministry will always increase the activity of monitoring internal symptoms among travellers at all international points of entry into Malaysia," said Khairy in a statement Saturday (July 30)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On arrival, if the traveller is detected to have a fever through the thermal scanner or found to be unwell, they will be referred for re-examination by the health department, he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After a health assessment is made and if there is a case of suspected illness due to infectious diseases such as Covid-19, monkeypox, MERS-CoV or others, the traveller will be referred to a nearby health facility for further check-up and treatment
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Accordingly, all newly arrived travellers from abroad must practice self-health status monitoring, comply with the set standard operating procedures (SOP) and are advised to go to a nearby health facility for examination if unwell," said Khairy.

                DEBUTANT Ng Tze Yong and his coach Hendrawan won admiration from the badminton fraternity for their acts of kindness in helping opponent Samuel Ricketts get a new pair of shoes after the Jamaican's footwear gave way during Malaysia's mixed team match at the NEC on Friday (July 29)

                Launching the celebrations at Dataran Putrajaya here today, Ismail said despite the independence, Keluarga Malaysia (Malaysian Family) was constantly faced with challenges from outside the country that could undermine the long-established harmony
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Liven up the National Day celebrations this year by decorating your premises with the Jalur Gemilang to show your love for the country,” he said at the launch of the celebrations here

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail said Covid-19 was the biggest challenge faced by the country and the whole world over the past two years, but Malaysia had managed the pandemic well because of the firm measures taken by the government
            </p>

                “Now, we are in the transition to the endemic phase and signs of economic recovery are visible, with Keluarga Malaysia beginning to enjoy the goodness of life like before.” Ismail said the National Day and Malaysia Day celebrations this year, themed “Keluarga Malaysia Teguh Bersama”, were most relevant to the concept of harmony in a big family living together in unity with a sense of gratefulness

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                I should know because Muhyiddin had asked me for DAP's support to be prime minister way back in July 2016 ..

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                but I declined to do so as the DAP was committed to Anwar Ibrahim as the prime minister candidate,” Lim said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “But Muhyiddin’s political life which culminated in his becoming the seventh prime minister but with the shortest term of 17 months had one saving factor — his uncompromising position against the 1MDB scandal, for which he was dismissed as deputy prime minister in July 2015 and later sacked from Umno in June 2016 by (Datuk Seri) Najib Razak,” Lim said

                “Idris should answer me based on facts, can he show us examples where the German culture festival has been a problem?” Oktoberfest, organised by the Malaysian-German Society, has been held in Penang for four decades

                Mak Hon Leong, 39, was charged on Wednesday with using and enjoying the title – which is not recognised – in his business and private dealings without the permission of His Highness the Sultan at the Kuala Lumpur High Court (Commercial Division), Sentul, here at 9am on Oct 22, 2021

                Asking for a reduced bail, lawyer Amer Hamzah Arshad, who represented Mak, said this was to ensure his client’s presence in court

                Non-stop rain that began at 2pm in Baling yesterday had caused water to rise above a newly built Bailey bridge in Kampung Iboi there

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nearly 80% of Penang’s tap water is sourced from Sungai Muda, which flows from two other rivers upstream of Baling
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When Baling was hit by floods earlier this month, water supply to Penang was interrupted for at least three days
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a statement, Penang Water Supply Corp (PBAPP) said the nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) level – the standard measurement of how turbid the raw water supply is – remained at a normal reading of 261
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During the previous Baling floods, which caused major disruptions to piped water supply throughout Penang, the NTU level hit 3,000

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                ON Dec 1, 1948, police found the body of a well-dressed man on Somerton Park beach in Adelaide, Australia, who had all the tags on his clothes removed and a scrap of paper in his pocket with the Persian phrase tamám shud (meaning finished) printed on it
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                So, for over 70 years, the man's identity was a mystery which spawned wild theories internationally of who he really was, from murdered spy to alien abductee
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Prof Derek Abbot from the University of Adelaide announced on Monday (July 25) that the Somerton Man was Carl "Charles" Webb, a 43-year-old electrical engineer from Melbourne who went missing around the same time
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Prof Abbot worked together with American Genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick using the DNA gathered from the body, as well as from hair gathered from a plaster face cast made of the man's by investigators after his body was found a match in a DNA database and developed a family tree to eke out his identity
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As to why the Melbourne man was in Adelaide, a city some 727km away, Prof Abbot told the daily that they had evidence that Webb was looking for his wife
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Australian police have yet to release a statement on the identity of the man, so his identity is yet to be confirmed though signs seem to point to the fact that Webb is the most likely candidate for the identity of the mysterious Somerton Man

                Sarawak has recognised the UEC since 2014, allowing holders of the certificate to work in the state civil service and apply for scholarships from Yayasan Sarawak and for entry into the state-owned University of Technology Sarawak

                Federal education minister Radzi Jidin recently said his ministry had no plans to recognise the UEC as it went against the National Education Policy

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Annuar said the world was now borderless and the government should not restrict anyone from acquiring the education of his or her choice
            </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The federal government’s role should be more towards financially supporting state governments in education matters.” Aside from its recognition of the UEC, the Sarawak government is aggressively pursuing mastery of English

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Due to cultural and religious biases, Malaysia struggles to acknowledge that FGM is a violation of bodily autonomy and bodily integrity," said Sivananthi Thanenthiran, executive director of the Asian-Pacific Resource and Research Centre for Women (ARROW) during the event here
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Speaking at the event, Reproductive Health Association of Kelantan president Datuk Dr Rashidah Shuib cited a 2020 study that pointed out that FGM here has been increasingly medicalised, with 20.5 per cent of the procedure done by doctors in Malaysia due to the perceived notion that the procedure is safer and more hygienic as such despite the fact that doctors are not taught FGM in the medical curriculum
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Small-scale, independent studies done in Malaysia have found that more than 90 per cent of Muslim women in Malaysia have undergone some form of FGM, with Type I (complete or partial removal of the clitoris or clitoral hood) and Type IV (non-medical harmful procedures such as pricking, piercing, incising, scraping, cauterising) being the most common
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Representatives from Muslim-majority countries had criticised Malaysia for allowing the practice of FGM, even when it is no longer considered to be in line with Islamic teachings
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Malaysian delegate then pointed out that Malaysia follows the Shafie school of Islamic jurisprudence, and that FGM is obligatory under a 2009 decision by the national fatwa committee unless it brings harm to the girl
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A representative from the Health Ministry had also claimed that FGM is safe and only medical professionals perform the procedure, while comparing it to immunisation programmes for female babies.

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Family Frontiers group said the ministry’s inefficiency and lack of responsibility demonstrated is incredibly unacceptable
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “With an approval rate of less than 0.6%, it can be deduced that it would take the home ministry around six centuries to process all applications,” the group said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The longer the home ministry delays the citizenship application process, the longer they deliberately place Malaysian women and their children in situations of harm and violence.” The lack of a long-term legal status in Malaysia creates heightened uncertainty and anxiety for Malaysian women and their non-citizen children, including the possibility of children being separated from their families at any point
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The group contrasted the ministry’s performance with its budget allocation of RM17 billion, one of the largest among all ministries
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Data by the national registration department showed that only 19 of the 3,407 citizenship applications had been approved from 2018 to June this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In slamming the ministry, Merbok MP Nor Azrina Surip, of PKR, said this meant the rate of approvals came up to 0.6% and it would take 681 years to approve all the child citizenship applications in Malaysia
