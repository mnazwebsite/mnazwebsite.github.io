                Penang PAS committee member Abdul Razib Abd Rahim said the state committee supported the central committee’s ummah unification agenda
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Penang is well known for being the heartland of Pakatan Harapan (PH)-DAP, so the agenda of unifying Malay parties is even more important here to prevent PH from taking advantage of any split in Malay-Muslim votes,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The slogan ‘Islam unites the ummah’ should be backed by all PAS supporters, so that efforts to unite Malay political parties are successful and in line with shariah and party policy.” Razib said the parties, which he did not name, must be committed towards this cause to ensure Malay-Muslim interests were not denied and neglected in Penang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Penang PAS calls for all parties to forgo their personal interests in GE15, and ensure that the Malay-Muslim vote can be united for the well-being and harmony of the people,” he said

            <p>

                Police and forensic investigators gather at the scene where suitcases with the remains of two children were found, after a family, who are not connected to the deaths, bought them at an online auction for an unclaimed locker, in Auckland, New Zealand, August 11, 2022 in this still image taken from video

                The grainy clips showed a man shouting “siau lang” (meaning maniac) in Hokkien while destroying furniture at a Taoist temple in Batu Itam, Balik Pulau
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In multiple videos that have since gone viral on social media, the man – carrying a backpack and wearing a yellow long-sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans – went on wrecking spree, destroying the temple furniture in the foyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The footage also showed him desecrating the temple by urinating in front of the shuttered doors to the shrine hall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                OCPD Supt Kamarul Rizal Jenal said they were made aware of the incident yesterday after two videos of the man misbehaving at the temple grounds began circulating on social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Supt Kamarul said the case would be investigated under Section 295 of the Penal Code for defiling a place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class and Section 427 of the Penal Code for committing mischief

                The grainy clips showed a man shouting “siau lang” (meaning maniac) in Hokkien while destroying furniture at a Taoist temple in Batu Itam, Balik Pulau
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In multiple videos that have since gone viral on social media, the man – carrying a backpack and wearing a yellow long-sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans – went on wrecking spree, destroying the temple furniture in the foyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The footage also showed him desecrating the temple by urinating in front of the shuttered doors to the shrine hall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                OCPD Supt Kamarul Rizal Jenal said they were made aware of the incident yesterday after two videos of the man misbehaving at the temple grounds began circulating on social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Supt Kamarul said the case would be investigated under Section 295 of the Penal Code for defiling a place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class and Section 427 of the Penal Code for committing mischief

                He urged civil servants to feel the spirit of Keluarga Malaysia among themselves so that they can instil a sense of belonging among all Malaysians

                The chief secretary to the government, Zuki Ali, said weaknesses and failings of the government were easily sensationalised by the media, rather than the successes and benefits achieved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We do not deny that there will be weaknesses, but the fact is we have also achieved a lot throughout this year,” said Zuki, who is the head of the civil service, when closing a Keluarga Malaysia symposium here today

                Singapore will decriminalise sex between men but has no plans to change the legal definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said today

                In Singapore, under Section 377A, offenders can be jailed for up to two years under the law, but it is not currently actively enforced

            <p>
                There have been no known convictions for sex between consenting adult males for decades and the law does not include sex between women or other genders

            <p>
                Resistance  In February, Singapore's highest court ruled that since the law is not being enforced, it does not breach constitutional rights, as the plaintiffs had argued, and it reaffirmed that the law could not be used to prosecute men for having gay sex

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Aug 21 — With the Covid-19 pandemic situation stabilising in Singapore, the Government will further relax rules on wearing of face masks in public, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To curb the spread of the coronavirus, people here used to have to put on face masks when they leave their homes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This rule was relaxed from March 29, with the wearing of face masks mandated only in indoor settings, though people were still encouraged to wear them when they leave home, especially in crowded areas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that beyond the infection controls, Singapore must learn the lessons from the pandemic, and be ready for a possible future where “a new virus will emerge, more transmissible, more adaptable and more dangerous than Covid-19”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The most important lesson is to maintain the spirit of personal and social responsibility,” Lee said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Continue to nurture the trust in our society — day in, day out — during normal times, so that during the next crisis, we can again draw upon a deep reservoir of trust to see us through, just like we have done during Covid-19.” In his speech, Lee also announced a new special state award called the Covid-19 Resilience Medal that will be presented to people who played a direct part in the fight against the pandemic.

                LGBTQ groups welcomed Lee's decision to repeal Section 377A of the penal code, a colonial-era law that criminalises sex between men, but also expressed concern that ruling out same-sex marriage would help to perpetuate discrimination

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Aug 21 — The investigation paper on the trial judge who heard Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s case over the misappropriation of RM42 million of government-owned firm SRC International Sdn Bhd is not with the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC), Tan Sri Idrus Harun said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last week, in a statement posted on Twitter, Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan claimed that a document alleged to be the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) investigation papers on judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali had been leaked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Maslan noted the Federal Court’s unanimous decision to reject Najib’s bid to admit new evidence on Mohd Nazlan’s purported conflict of interest as part of his final appeal over his conviction in the SRC International case, and that the MACC investigation paper on the judge was sent to the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) on May 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then said Umno is of the view that “MACC has to confirm or deny the validity of the investigation papers that have gone viral”, and that the “Attorney General’s Chambers has to announce if there will be further action for those investigation papers”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 23, news portal Malaysiakini reported Idrus as saying that the AGC is still examining the investigation papers by the MACC on Mohd Nazlan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are perusing the investigation paper before we make our decision,” he was quoted as saying via a text message.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 21 — PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Abdul Hadi Awang’s “racist and extremist anti-non-Bumi and anti-non-Muslim rhetoric” blaming them for being the root of corruption is a shrewd strategy designed to strengthen PAS’ electoral prospects in the general election, DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng said

                Surely in this day and age, when the world is battling gender inequality, we shouldn’t deny Malaysian mothers the right to confer citizenship on their children who were born abroad, just as Malaysian fathers are allowed to, says the columnist

            <p>
                The literal translation into English would be, “My country, the land upon which my blood has spilled”, but there’s clearly some poetic licence to be exercised

            <p>
                The English translation on Wikipedia has it as “My motherland, land of my birth”, while I’ve seen the more passionate “My country that I live and die for”

            <p>
                It reminds me of the concept of jus soli (the right of the soil), or birthright citizenship, which is the idea that if you are born in a country, you are automatically a citizen of that country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was the principle applied in the early days of Malaya and Malaysia, that if you were born here before a certain date, no matter who your parents were, you were considered a citizen

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 21 — PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Abdul Hadi Awang’s “racist and extremist anti-non-Bumi and anti-non-Muslim rhetoric” blaming them for being the root of corruption is a shrewd strategy designed to strengthen PAS’ electoral prospects in the general election, DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng said
            </p>

                However, the Marang MP also accused non-Muslims and non-Bumiputera of making up the bulk of what he called the “roots of corruption” to the detriment of the country’s economy and politics

            <p>
                “They then damage our politics as they are the roots for corruption and the majority of them are non-Muslims and non-Bumiputras,” he said in a posting on his Facebook page

                By putting a racial and religious slant on corruption with false and baseless claims, Hadi has clearly positioned himself as the principal proponent against non-Bumis and non-Muslims in Malaysia,” Lim added

                The court had set Aug 15 to 19 and Aug 23 to 26 to hear the appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Mohamed Haniff Khatri Abdulla said this is because the court could decide based on the written submissions filed previously by Najib's defence team at the Court of Appeal last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Lim Wei Jiet also concurred, saying that as the country's highest court, it will likely decide based on the grounds of appeal in the memorandum of appeal, appeal records as well as the Court of Appeal's previous submissions by Najib's defence team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyer once again asked the court to postpone the hearing to Thursday (Aug 25) as he has other cases on Tuesday (Aug 23) and Wednesday (Aug 24), but it was rejected by the court as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 16, the court dismissed Hisyam's application to postpone the appeal hearing and ordered the appeal to proceed on Aug 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision and dismissed Najib's appeal to set aside his conviction and jail sentence as well as the fine

            <p>
                Lawyer Mohamed Haniff Khatri Abdulla said this is because the court could decide based on the written submissions filed previously by Najib's defence team at the Court of Appeal last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Lim Wei Jiet also concurred, saying that as the country's highest court, it will likely decide based on the grounds of appeal in the memorandum of appeal, appeal records as well as the Court of Appeal's previous submissions by Najib's defence team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyer once again asked the court to postpone the hearing to Thursday (Aug 25) as he has other cases on Tuesday (Aug 23) and Wednesday (Aug 24), but it was rejected by the court as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 16, the court dismissed Hisyam's application to postpone the appeal hearing and ordered the appeal to proceed on Aug 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision and dismissed Najib's appeal to set aside his conviction and jail sentence as well as the fine

                Penang deputy police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Fisol Salleh (second leftt) with other police personnel looking at two motorcycles that have been confiscated at the Southwest District Police Headquarters in Balik Pulau, Penang.

                This could happen once the police applies to impose these penalties against negligent parents under Section 33 of the Child Act 2001 in order to hold parents accountable when their underaged children end up as illegal racers, said Penang deputy police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Fisol Salleh

                It is your duty as a parent to know what your children are doing,” he said

            <p>
                The July 17 crash related to illegal racing killed Mohd Haziq Harris, 34, Muhammad Shazwan Hakim Mohd Abdul Sani, 22, Muhammad Eizreel Muhamad Roszaidi, 25, Ahmad Haikal Naif Ahmad Nazrul, 19, and Muhammad Harith Zikri Yusnizar, 17.Another rider who was injured, Muhammad Rahimi Shukor, 19, was discharged from hospital, while Muhammad Shazwan Hafiz Mohd Abdul Sani, 22, was transferred to a private hospital.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 20 — The anti-government movement called Gerakan Tolak #KerajaanGagal initially slated to organise a street rally today has cancelled the event, announcing that it will take its campaign to rural areas and East Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spokesman for the movement Muhammad Syahmi Shamsudin said it decided against another protest in front of Sogo like last week since there is a need to raise awareness with the public outside Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We feel we can't do the same campaign or protests like before and this issue is so big that holding events in the city may not have the desired effect," he said in a press conference here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This government under Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob has failed the people miserably especially the MPs from Umno and Barisan Nasional
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Initially, a protest was planned in front of Sogo Mall in Kuala Lumpur at 2pm today but yesterday night plans were changed to a press conference and a gathering opposite the University of Malaya

            <p>
                So I will say here bravely and without fear that we are very serious with this movement and come what may we are committed to see it through," he added.
