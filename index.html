                Lorry driver Saffri Kamaruddin, 50, admitted that his EPF savings would not be enough to sustain him after retirement in view of the rising cost of living

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said he planned to use whatever he has as EPF savings as capital to run a business

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A factory worker, known as Krishnan, 55, said he has increased his monthly contribution to EPF to ensure his savings will be enough when he retires
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If it’s not enough, then I will have to work after retiring

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Meanwhile, a consultant at an aviation school, Zulfadli Halim, 50, said that the hike in the cost of living has made it difficult for him to increase his monthly contribution to EPF and he was worried about his future

                “EPF members’ savings are at a low and very worrying level, especially after the four withdrawals and the reduction in the employee share of the statutory contribution rate,” he said, adding that as of June 30, 6.62 million members — or 52% of the total of 12.78 million EPF members aged under 55 — had savings of less than RM10,000

                The PSB president revealed today that as its candidate in the Sarawak state elections last December, See signed a contract that required him to quit from the state assembly if he chose to resign from the party having won the seat under the PSB ticket
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said See’s resignation from the party, as announced by Sarawak state assembly Speaker Asfia Awang Nasar earlier today, would mean he must now vacate his seat
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “See is fully aware of the commitments, both oral and written, that he had given to PSB before he was selected to be the PSB candidate for Batu Lintang,” Wong said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Noting that See was a senior lawyer, Wong said the now independent assemblyman knew what he committed to in writing before he was chosen as a candidate for the state constituency
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As a matter of principle, PSB will avail itself of all necessary actions and remedies in respect of the commitments made by See.” Aside from vacating his seat, Wong said the agreement also included an undertaking to compensate the party if See quit the party after enjoying the benefit of PSB’s resources in getting elected
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Deputy chief minister Bung Moktar Radin said this is one of the main reasons behind high unemployment and poverty rates in the state

                He added that the state government was sensitive to the situation where the completion of infrastructure projects, especially the construction of the Pan Borneo Highway, is an important effort to attract investors and further stimulate the state’s economic development

                Bung Moktar, who is state works minister, was asked to comment on the latest economic report which states that Sabah has one of the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Kinabatangan MP said that the state government had also asked Putrajaya to increase the number of work packages for the highway construction project for implementation next year in order to speed up the completion of the Pan Borneo Highway

                John reportedly said Sabah PKR members were hoping for Anwar to resolve the problem of the existence of two camps there — one which was aligned with then Sabah PKR chief Christina Liew, and another one aligned with PKR Keningau division chief Datuk Sangkar Rasam and the latter's nephew and former Sabah PKR youth chief and current Pensiangan PKR division chief Raymond Ahuar
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Anwar on August 6 announced that Sangkar would replace Liew as Sabah PKR chief
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                John reportedly said he was not questioning the decision to change the Sabah PKR chief as it was the PKR president's prerogative to do so, but said this was the "wrong timing" and that the party's focus should instead be on the 15th general election (GE15) which he said was just around the corner
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                These were the only two seats that PKR had won in Sabah in the general elections in 2018, with Liew winning the Tawau seat then
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Liew is currently also the Api-Api state assemblyman and was formerly deputy chief minister of Sabah, and had been a PKR member for the past 20 years and had been the Sabah PKR chief since October 2016

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to The Star, Sangkar had last December led 16 Sabah PKR division chiefs in calling for Anwar to drop Liew as Sabah PKR chief

                "Is Malaysia’s stronger than expected 2022 second-quarter growth of 8.9 per cent due to the extraordinary increase in private sector consumption and investment of 18.3 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively following the one-off Employees Provident Fund (EPF) special withdrawals of RM10,000 disbursed in April 2022
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, Malaysia was announced to have recorded a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2022 when compared to the same quarter in 2021
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim noted that private sector consumption in Malaysia only grew by 5.5 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022, in contrast to the 18.9 per cent year-on-year growth in the second quarter of 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "If the RM44 billion from the RM10,000 one-off special EPF withdrawal did not generate the 18.3 per cent jump in private sector consumption for the second quarter, Bank Negara should determine the source of the increase
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim said there was concern about whether Malaysia's second-quarter economic growth is too reliant on firm domestic demand, particularly the RM44 billion one-off special EPF withdrawals
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Since there will be no more RM44 billion one-off EPF special withdrawals in the pipeline, Malaysia’s economic growth will depend on external demand, which is subject to slower global growth," he said
