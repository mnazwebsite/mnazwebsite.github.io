                While inflation is expected to increase this year at an average of 3.3%, it said, this will be significantly below the rate of disposable income growth of 7.2%

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Disposable income growth in 2023 will slow but still remain above the inflation rate

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This will remain the case in 2024, with the trend of household disposable income outpacing inflation maintained throughout our forecast period to 2026

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “These growth outlooks indicate that while Malaysian consumers are spending more on discretionary spending than they did during or before the pandemic, they are focusing that spending on experiences rather than tangible products

                The junta has sentenced dozens of anti-coup activists to death as part of its crackdown on dissent after seizing power last year, but Myanmar had not carried out an execution for decades

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Phyo Zeya Thaw, a former lawmaker from Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) who was arrested in November, was sentenced to death in January for offences under anti-terrorism laws

                Prominent democracy activist Kyaw Min Yu — better known as “Jimmy” — received the same sentence from the military tribunal

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                TODAY also asked if ICA is considering a review of its policy of not checking 100 per cent of outgoing vehicles at the border checkpoints
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In response, ICA said that Singapore’s land checkpoints are one of the busiest land crossings in the world, and about 200,000 travellers depart daily prior to the coronavirus pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Any delay in clearing departure traffic during peak hours can cause traffic tailback onto the roads inland, such as the Bukit Timah Expressway for Woodlands Checkpoint and the Ayer Rajah Expressway for Tuas Checkpoint, said ICA
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                ICA said that it adopts a “risk management approach” to departure clearance screening of people, goods and conveyances and takes an “arrival-centric approach” to border security, which ICA added is a common practice internationally and done to optimise resources
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This is why the approach to departure checks changes based on Singapore’s prevailing security posture, ICA said in its response
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                About Us Advertise LONDON, July 25 — Rishi Sunak yesterday promised to get tough on China if he becomes Britain’s next prime minister, calling the Asian superpower the “number one threat” to domestic and global security

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s state-run Global Times has previously said Sunak was the only candidate in the contest with “a clear and pragmatic view on developing UK-China ties”

                Yet British government policy when both Sunak and Truss were in Johnson’s cabinet has warned about China before

                In March last year, its integrated review of security, defence and foreign policy called China “the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At the same time, London has recognised that China’s power and international assertiveness was here to stay, and called Beijing a “systemic competitor”

                “The lessons from Covid-19 remain relevant for monkeypox,” global health specialist Dr Khor Swee Kheng said, adding that WHO’s announcement of monkeypox as a “public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)” highlighted the vigilance that countries needed to adopt against the disease

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sunak’s proposals include the closure of all 30 Confucius Institutes in Britain, preventing the soft-power spread of Chinese influence through culture and language programmes

                In March last year, its integrated review of security, defence and foreign policy called China “the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security”

                At the same time, London has recognised that China’s power and international assertiveness was here to stay, and called Beijing a “systemic competitor”

                The basis that Azam has adopted in dismissing any perception that Malaysia’s standing in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (TI-CPI) is alarming and should instead be seen as “I’m alright, Jack, the lark is on the wing” is perhaps as heartening as his other famous statement that “I was doing it for my brother”

                Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh said it was important for the police to release the post-mortem report as the family could look into the possibility of an inquest

                He said the tripartite agreement involving the then Sultan of Sulu, Sultan Jamal Al Alam, the then maharaja of Sabah, Baron de Overbeck, and British North Borneo Company’s Alfred Dent was written in Malay using the Jawi script
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The agreement has no reference for parties to resolve any dispute of North Borneo (Sabah) by way of arbitration,” he told FMT
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the 2019 letter to the lawyer of the Sulu heirs sighted by FMT, Thomas attached a copy of a 1939 judgment by the North Borneo High Court and said Malaysia did not dispute the identity of the individuals and their right to be paid
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Firoz said Malaysia had no choice but to set aside the award but it was going to be a “challenging” task because of Article 5 of the New York Convention
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under the agreement, Jamal ceded sovereignty over large parts of Sabah to Dent and Overbeck, who agreed that they and their future heirs were to pay the heirs of the sultan 5,000 Mexican dollars annually
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Although Malaysia took over these payments when it became the successor of the agreement following Sabah’s independence and the formation of Malaysia in 1963, these payments – equivalent to RM5,300 a year – ceased in 2013 after an incursion by armed men into Lahad Datu, along the eastern coast of Sabah

                "Kalibr missiles destroyed Odesa port's military infrastructure, sending a Ukrainian military boat to the Kiev regime's favourite address in a precision strike," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The "favourite address" is an ironic reference to the exhortations of Ukrainian forces on Snake Island in the Black Sea who reportedly told a Russian ship to "go f***" itself before a Russian strike in February

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy denounced the strikes on Odesa as blatant "barbarism" that showed Moscow could not be trusted to implement Friday's deal, mediated by Turkey and the United Nations

                Singaporean Pi Jiapeng and his wife thai national Pansuk Siriwipa have allegedly failed to deliver luxury goods worth about S$32 million (RM103 million) to customers and fled Singapore in a container compartment of a lorry on July 4

                It was responding to queries from The Straits Times on Saturday (July 23) about how the couple allegedly involved in a luxury goods scam managed to flee Singapore early this month

                China's foreign ministry said the next day a visit to Taiwan by her would seriously undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the United States would bear the consequences of its response

                The Sulu heirs, it is reported, might be eyeing the takeover of other 167 global assets of Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The trial in the French court might be crucial to determine whether there is light at the end of the tunnel over Malaysia’s dispute with the Sulu heirs, in other words, the Philippines

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Political agenda It is clear that Najib has his own political agenda in shifting the blame for the ongoing dispute with the Sulu heirs on the former Harapan government and on the former AG Thomas

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Whether the letter written by Thomas while in office to the Sulu heirs in offering a new compensation of RM48,000 was prejudicial or not is not the question, but why was it written and whether he disagreed with the earlier decision of not paying the Sulu heirs
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is clear that the Najib government was responsible for the present imbroglio with the Sulu heirs

                About Us Advertise PARIS, July 24 — Iran yesterday carried out its first public execution in over two years, an NGO said, denouncing the practice as "medieval" as concern grows over rising repression in the Islamic republic

                Iman Sabzikar, who had been convicted over the murder of a police officer in February 2022 in the southern city of Shiraz, was hanged in the early morning at the scene of the crime, Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It said that Iranian state media has reported on the public execution taking place and that the convict had been identified as Sabzikar, whose sentence of being hanged in public had been confirmed by the supreme court earlier this month

                "The resumption of this brutal punishment in public is intended to scare and intimidate people from protesting," said IHR's director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam

                Executions in Iran usually take place within the walls of prison and activists say public executions are used as a deterrent, especially when the crime concerns the killing of a member of the security forces

                Sadao police superintendent Pol Col Bunthaeng Laocharoen told Bernama that 55-year-old Teow, founder of MBI Group International, had been handed over to the Immigration Police in Songkhla and would later be transferred to the Suan Plu Immigration Office in Bangkok

                He was arrested in a raid conducted by a team led by Thai national police assistant chief Pol Lt-Gen Surachate Hakparn, which led to the police searching Teow’s MBI Group’s office in Sadao at the Thai-Malaysian border

                “It’s been a 20-year wait and we should move forward.”  Nicholas suggested that instead of amending the existing Act alone, the government should consider developing several legislation in relation to the Orang Asli

                Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak speaks at a Conservative Party leadership campaign event in Grantham, Britain, July 23, 2022

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sunak's resignation helped trigger a revolt that saw Prime Minister Boris Johnson agree to step down after a series of scandals

                Truss held a 24-point lead over Sunak in a YouGov poll of Conservative Party members published on Thursday

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Be in no doubt, I am the underdog," Sunak said in a speech in the central England town of Grantham, the birthplace of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher

                "The forces that be want this to be a coronation for the other candidate, but I think members want a choice and they are prepared to listen." Truss would be only Britain's third female prime minister after Thatcher and Theresa May, while Sunak would be the country's first leader of Indian origin
