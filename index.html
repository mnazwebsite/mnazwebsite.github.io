                The statement by the police this evening follows the revelation by the victim, a student at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM), that it had been more than a year since she filed a report about it with the police and the university administration

                According to the report, this came two days after Ahmad Zahid received a letter from BNS on July 8, 2011 recommending the selection of the Gowind design, before BNS issued a letter of intent to French subcontractor company DCNS on July 13, 2011 to begin the concept design and design evaluation process
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The report found that BNS was determined to choose the Gowind design because it had held prior discussions and negotiations with DCNS to carry out the construction of the LCS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This can be proved when BNS issued a Letter of Intent to DCNS on July 13, 2011, two days after (then) defence minister, Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, expressed his agreement with BNS’ recommendation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In fact, BNS also started the Conceptual Design process with DCNS on July 25, 2011, which was before the original Letter of Acceptance (SST) was issued on December 16, 2011
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This happened during the Analysis on the BNS Evaluation for MS to RMN on July 11, 2011
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, MoF on December 21, 2011 only agreed to approve an advance payment of RM500 million to BNS

                “PH, when in power, refused to make public the Special Independent Committee on Foreign Worker Management report by (former Suhakam chairman) Hishamudin Yunus

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Why?” The special independent committee was formed by the PH government to coordinate overall policies and the management of foreign workers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The committee was then tasked with travelling around the country to gain insights on the hiring of foreign workers and to make recommendations to the government in a report that – according to former human resources minister M Kula Segaran – was to be made public
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Kula had previously called for the report to be made public in June 2020, when Perikatan Nasional was in power

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a statement, he said he submitted the independent report to the Cabinet which contained proposals that would have made the management of foreign workers transparent

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When contacted, Arulchelvan told FMT that PH missed its chance to make the report public and implement its proposed reforms to better manage foreign workers

                Jasin OCPD Deputy Supt Mispani Hamdan said the elderly couple was walking along the street at about 11.30am on Tuesday (Aug 16), when an ongoing car hit them, causing them to be tossed into the air

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                DSP Mispani said the driver of the car was heading towards the Jasin market while the couple was walking towards a row of shophouses in the opposite direction
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the couple are in stable condition after receiving treatment at Jasin Hospital

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                DSP Mispani said the driver was shocked that he had unintentionally mowed down his own relatives when he alighted his car to help the victims

                He said farmers have now limited chicken production to meet only domestic demand following the export ban on whole chicken from June 1

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The talk that the export ban would be lifted has placed them in a quandary as “most farmers are afraid to raise chickens at this time because they don’t want to have excess poultry”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The government has provided no answers on how long the ban will be in place

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lamenting the lack of information and slow decision-making by the government, he called on Putrajaya to provide clarification on the export ban as soon as possible or risk causing further damage to the poultry industry
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Exports of whole chicken have been banned since June 1 to stem the chicken shortage, but confusion arose when later that month, Putrajaya eased the ban, allowing poultry importers abroad to resume getting live premium chickens from Malaysia

                In a statement, the party's committee member Lim Wei Jiet said that none of the companies to which Ahmad Ramli was charged with channelling payments without the company's approval, was explicitly mentioned in the PAC report

                The second charge was for approving a payment of RM1,360,716 payment to JSD Corporation Pte Ltd at the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited in Singapore also without approval of the BNS board

                Ahmad Ramli, who was also chairman of the LCS Steering Committee, also allegedly appointed committee members without the approval of the BNS board

                In its report released on August 8, Parliament's bipartisan watchdog Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said BNS was awarded a RM9.128 billion 10-year contract from 2013 to 2023 for the supply of the six LCS

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The PAC report also said the Malaysian government had to date already paid RM6.083 billion to the contractor, but none of the six LCS vessels has been completed
