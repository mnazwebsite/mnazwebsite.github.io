                “How is he supposed to be a leader when he could not understand a basic thing?” said Fahmi Fadzil, PKR’s information chief
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Did he not read the (MoU) in full, or is he not understanding it on purpose due to certain reasons?” Fahmi said the MoU, signed between Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Pakatan Harapan (PH) leaders last year, said it would remain in effect until the day Parliament is dissolved
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The MoU also stated the government agreed not to propose dissolution of Parliament before July 31, Fahmi said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nur Jazlan had said in a Facebook posting today that July 31 was the last day of the agreement

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Fahmi said the MoU stated that the agreement would not affect the opposition’s role in providing checks and balances on the government as well as ensuring that Putrajaya will be accountable to the Parliament and to the rakyat

                PH captured power in Selangor and four other states in the 2008 general election, and was returned to power in 2013 and 2018 in the state

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail, when choosing the lineup for his Cabinet, said he wanted to appoint Noh as law minister but decided against it as he wanted to give him a post where he could do more in terms of service to the people
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “At the time I became prime minister, Noh had no post
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                I thought that if we gave positions to the leaders of Selangor, there was better hope of us seizing back Selangor.” Ismail then jokingly asked Noh to channel funds to move the election machinery of the Selangor BN to face GE15, that he said was supposed to be “very close”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail said it was time to stop the infighting within the coalition and focus on bringing the fight to the opposition

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When asked by reporters on whether the political funding bill would be enacted before GE15, Ismail said the query could be better answered by law minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar

                “If BN wants to win the state back this time around, it needs to do more than what PH offered the people then,” Mua’ti said at a forum titled “Analysis of Selangor Politics and Government Administration” at the Selangor BN convention today
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sia Bik Kai, a senior lecturer at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, said Chinese voters in Selangor wanted a state government that could manage well the flood and water supply issues
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Unless BN can come up with solutions, it will be hard to attract Chinese voters.” He said BN must also cater to the needs of the older Chinese voters, 70-80% of whom were still active within their communities and were more likely to come out to vote in GE15
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said to win over the Chinese voters, Selangor BN needed to fix the inflation and economy-related issues, like unemployment and wage inequality

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sivamurugan Pandian, of Universiti Sains Malaysia, said BN needed to introduce an alternative to the First Selangor Plan (RS-1), introduced by PH recently to give the people a viable option
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sivamurugan said BN must also put forth more female candidates to reflect the makeup of the Selangor people — which is now about 52% women

                Hadi added that this was compounded by Umno leaders who decided to reject the leadership of former prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin, leading to his resignation last August

                Muhyiddin, who is also Perikatan Nasional (PN) chairman, was forced to step down after some 11 MPs from Umno withdrew their support for him

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Umno vice-president Ismail Sabri Yaakob was then appointed prime minister

                The statement made no mention of whether the six-member delegation would visit Taiwan, a flashpoint in conversations between China and the United States in the run-up to the trip

                The United States maintains a policy of "strategic ambiguity" over whether it would intervene militarily were China to invade Taiwan, and while it recognises Beijing's claim to the island, it also backs the democratic Taiwanese government

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 — Tobacco manufacturers in Malaysia are unhappy with the proposed Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Act 2022, arguing that it gave too much power to authorities and will cause a breach of basic human rights

                “In the end, instead of creating a smoke-free generation, we are creating a generation of criminals who are being punished for buying a product others can buy,” the group said in a statement today
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Bill, which was tabled for its first reading by Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin last Wednesday, provides for, among others, the prohibition of smoking, buying or possessing tobacco products or smoking devices by the Generational End-Game (GEG) or individuals, born in 2007 onwards

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The punishments provided in the Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022 states there will be no criminal record for GEG offenders, and they will only be fined, if convicted
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to Section 17 of the proposed act, no person who was born on January 1, 2007 onwards shall smoke any tobacco product or substitute tobacco product; use any smoking device; or possess any tobacco product, smoking substance, substitute tobacco product or smoking device

                This is in contrast to the regular southwest monsoon season that occurs from May till September yearly, which is generally drier and hotter in Malaysia and its neighbouring countries, as explained in the Northeast Monsoon Report released by MetMalaysia in May

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The weather can become quite humid due to the monsoon break in which the south-west winds of the country become weak and occasionally multi-directional, resulting in the increased formation of thunderstorm clouds that can last from the afternoon until the night
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “MetMalaysia predicts that there will not be a prolonged period of days without rain and the country is expected to experience this kind of situation alternately throughout the southwest monsoon this year,” said MetMalaysia director-general Muhammad Helmi Abdullah when asked about the drastic change in the weather recently
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The country is currently receiving consistent westerly winds and the resulting squall line phenomenon that carries straight-line winds can cause thunderstorm weather conditions in the early morning especially in the waters of the Malacca Strait, the west coast of the peninsula and west Sabah

                “The country is still affected by the La Nina phenomenon that has a 62%-66% chance of continuing until December, thus affecting the southwest monsoon in the region which should cause the number of days without rain to decrease in most areas of our country,” he said

                Sultan Nazrin added that the country was the ninth largest importer of rice, importing around US$620mil (RM2.7bil) worth of rice in 2020

                “The nearly three years that we have been affected by Covid-19 highlights the critical status of the lack of food supply in the country to the point that we have needed help from other countries to ensure we have enough food,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The culture of having every household produce one type of food crop should be instilled,” Sultan Nazrin said, adding that it was time to create a new generation of farmers, expand food crop areas and encourage production through modern methods, even on small pieces of land

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On January 14, 2020, the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak granted all nine court orders sought by Malaysia, including declarations that there is no arbitration agreement in the 1878 document or between Malaysia and the eight; declarations that Malaysia did not waive its sovereign immunity to confer jurisdiction for the Madrid court to appoint Stampa as arbitrator and that he has no jurisdiction over the sovereign state of Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court in Sabah also granted Malaysia injunctions to stop the eight claimants from continuing the arbitration in Spain and to stop them from enforcing awards made in the Spanish arbitration
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia asked the High Court in Madrid to enforce the High Court’s January 2020 decision in Sabah, which said the Spanish arbitration should stop
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Despite the Paris Court of Appeal’s court order which would effectively have required the arbitration to stop, Stampa rejected Malaysia’s December 17, 2021 request to immediately stop the arbitration by December 20, 2021

                “Malaysia needs to look inwards as to how we deal with all these other issues such as the ‘super inflation’ and the complications arising out of the Russia-Ukraine war, instead of focusing just on what is brewing in China,” he told FMT

                On July 15, Bloomberg reported that China’s real estate slump, which began in 2021 with curbs on mortgages and funding for property developers, would damage the Chinese economy, and effects would be felt by the rest of the world

                It said it was wrong to compare the RM600 “presumed work value” of housewives under the Housewives’ Social Security Bill 2022 (SKSSR) with the RM1,500 minimum wage for workers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If the ‘presumed work value’ is revised to match the RM1,500 minimum wage, then the contribution rate would increase to RM418.80 a year or RM34.90 per month,” said Socso’s chief communications and corporate affairs officer Izad Raya, in a statement issued today

                Perkeso was responding to an FMT report earlier in which several women’s rights groups criticised the government’s RM600 “presumed work value” of a housewife, saying it did not reflect the amount of work she does
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Monday, the bill came under fire while being debated in the Dewan Rakyat due to a clause that mentions RM600 as the “presumed work value” of a housewife

                Yeoh, who is a former deputy women, family and community development minister, also said if RM600 was seen as the presumed monthly income rate, then a housewife would only be earning RM20 per day

                On Saturday (July 30), at the Road March 2022 programme, in conjunction with 215th Police Day celebrations at Dataran Merdeka, people started lining up as early as 7am, even though the counters only opened at 9am

                Abu Kassim Karim, in his 40s, said he chose to pay the summonses at Dataran Merdeka despite the long queue, as he could enjoy some savings by doing so
            </p>
