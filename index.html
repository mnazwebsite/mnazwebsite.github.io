                Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak speaks at a Conservative Party leadership campaign event in Grantham, Britain, July 23, 2022

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sunak's resignation helped trigger a revolt that saw Prime Minister Boris Johnson agree to step down after a series of scandals

                Truss held a 24-point lead over Sunak in a YouGov poll of Conservative Party members published on Thursday

                "Be in no doubt, I am the underdog," Sunak said in a speech in the central England town of Grantham, the birthplace of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher

                "The forces that be want this to be a coronation for the other candidate, but I think members want a choice and they are prepared to listen." Truss would be only Britain's third female prime minister after Thatcher and Theresa May, while Sunak would be the country's first leader of Indian origin

                But the High Court on May 23 this year dismissed Apandi’s defamation lawsuit, after having found that the evidence produced in court — including Apandi’s own testimony — showed Lim as having successfully proven his defences
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court expressed its disdain for what it described as Apandi’s own contradictions in his testimony in court as his own witness during the hearing of the defamation lawsuit, his “evasiveness and outright untruth”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On this point alone, the judge said it was glaringly obvious that Lim’s remark on Apandi is justified
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court said it was suspicious on how Apandi had “hastily adopted the donation narrative” when he himself as the attorney general “does not even care to remember or to know the name of the fabled donor (which is obviously a critical information for the investigation)”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court ultimately concluded that Lim has proven the full defence of justification

                “Yet, he (Mahathir) is now blaming the Barisan Nasional (BN) administration for stopping the payment to the heirs of the Sulu sultanate,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the report, Mahathir said the payment should be stopped because the alleged Sulu descendants had allegedly breached the terms
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the government obtained a stay order against the enforcement of the French arbitration court ruling that ordered it to pay US$14.92 billion to the heirs of the sultanate

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to the letter, Thomas offered to settle the multi-billion dollar claim with a RM48,000 compensation payment

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sabah Law Society (SLS) president Roger Chin yesterday said Thomas’s admission had put Malaysia in a tight spot in its efforts to defend itself against the Sulu claim

                Rizal, whose full name is Mohd Rizal Van Geyzel, claimed trial to the charges after they were read out by a court interpreter before Sessions Court judge Nor Hasniah Ab Razak yesterday

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rizal was charged under Section 233(1)(a) of the Communications and Multimedia Act, an offence punishable under Section 233(3) of the same Act

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the prosecution suggested RM30,000 bail if the court uses its discretion to grant bail to the accused

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lawyer Ramkarpal Singh asked the court to allow a RM2,000 bail for each charge

                Judge Nor Hasniah then granted RM12,000 bail for all charges and ordered Rizal to surrender his passport to the court

                Sabah Law Society president Roger Chin said Thomas’s admission had put Malaysia in a tight spot in its efforts to defend itself against the Sulu claim
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Thus the contents of Thomas’ letter were clearly “relied upon” by the Sulu claimants in their arbitration claim against Malaysia in Madrid and Paris, said Chin
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said that Thomas should have taken steps to defend Malaysia against the Spanish arbitration claim, instead of merely not recognising the Spanish court’s jurisdiction to arbitrate the Sulu claim
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Resorting to copying letters to the Spanish arbitrator was an admission that Malaysia was aware of the case, said Chin
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also questioned if Thomas had consulted the then de facto law minister Liew Vui Keong before responding to the Sulu heir’s letter of demand

                "If the company and driver fail the audit, which is a part of the conditions set by the Land Transport Agency (Apad) and the Road Transport Department (JPJ), the operator's permit and license may be suspended or revoked

                "The driver's license can also be taken by the JPJ based on provisions under the Road Transport Act if the driver is charged in court," he said in a Facebook post on Friday (July 22)

                The court was also shown how she walked across the road to a taxi stand near Bank Rakyat on Magazine Road

                After the clinic, the court visited the Ramakrishna Ashram on Scotland Road, where Anna was last seen alighting from the same Uber vehicle

                The site visit was supposed to end then, but on the insistence of the Jenkins’ family lawyer, Raveentharan Subramaniam, the court headed to Batu Gantong, where Jenkin’s skeletal remains were found three years after her disappearance

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Raveentharan then explained to the coroner that it was impossible for Anna to have walked from the Ashram to this point, as it was almost 2km away, and the access road was on a terraced hill

                In his statement of defence in a suit filed against him by Shahril, Rafizi said he raised the issue as Shahril's remuneration when he served as the CEO did not commensurate with Sapura's financial performance
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                MSWG, meanwhile, raised the issue of Shahril's remuneration package being excessive which had been brought up at a previous Sapura AGM
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The MSWG had further condemned Sapura's corporate governance mechanism at the 2018 AGM and the payment of the intellectual property rights, trademark and branding fee to Sapura Holdings Sdn Bhd in which Shahril holds a direct shareholding,” Rafizi added in his defence statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Shahril, who is presently the president and Group CEO of Sapura Group, had filed the suit via Messrs Zul Rafique & Partners following Rafizi's statement questioning the remuneration and the move to inject more public funds to bail out the company
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former PKR lawmaker was of the view that public funds should not be used to bail the company out

                He said that between 2009 and 2021, Sapura had paid Shahril approximately RM1.1 billion in total remuneration, of which RM980 million to RM990 million was paid during Najib's tenure as the Prime Minister from 2009 to 2018

                The ringgit was pegged to the US dollar from 1998 to 2005, and Bank Negara Malaysia had on July 21, 2005 shifted to a managed float system for the ringgit

                On May 13, however, Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Tan Sri Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said it would not be in Malaysia's best interest to peg the ringgit as it would carry substantial risks such as having to mirror the monetary policy of the country that the ringgit is pegged against, and being very costly as it would take up a sizeable amount of reserves

                Health minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the education ministry’s current allocation of RM2.50 per pupil in the peninsula and RM3 in Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan was insufficient to cover the cost of raw materials

                About Us Advertise SIBU, July 22 — Sarawak Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg urged the federal government tonight to swiftly honour the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) in its entirety, in the spirit of Keluarga Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “What our Sarawak leaders had included then as provisions in the agreement as part of Malaysia were what they considered as necessary to protect the rights and interests of Sarawak and its people during their time, during our time and after our time,” he said at the Sarawak Day celebration at the Indoor Stadium here
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He noted that the events leading to the surrender of power of self-government to Sarawak on July 22, 1963 followed by the formation of Malaysia on September 16, 1963 based on MA63
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said agreement signed by Britain, Federation of Malaya, Sarawak, Sabah (North Borneo) and Singapore was a foundation on the formation of Malaysia which was recognised by the United Nations
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                A source told FMT that Santhara submitted a letter to Bersatu secretary-general Hamzah Zainudin last week on his departure from the party

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The source said Santhara did not see any future for non-Bumiputera MPs in the Muhyiddin Yassin-led party

                Bersatu is trying to persuade him to change his mind, but he has said he will be going ahead with it.”  Santhara was the first non-Bumiputera MP to join Bersatu in August 2020

                In January this year, Santhara said he was staying on with Bersatu despite receiving numerous offers to join other parties in the next general election (GE15)

                I will remain in Bersatu with party president Muhyiddin Yassin,” he said in response to Parti Bangsa Malaysia (PBM) asking him to join the party
