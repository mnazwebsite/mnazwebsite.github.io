                Public Bank Bhd banking services manager Tan Kok Kiong, 32, said he also could not confirm that the money which was deposited through a cheque dated March 22, 2014, into a Public Bank account in the name of ZAM Engineering & Construction was entrusted to Shahrir

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Tan, who works at the Muar branch of Public Bank, agreed with the lawyer’s suggestion that he could not confirm if the money that went into the company’s bank account was actually a reimbursement

                Earlier, when reading his witness statement, Tan said the application to open the account was made by ZAM Engineering & Construction partners Hamidah Basir and Nur Faizah Zulkifli on Jan 25, 2013, and RM63,800 was deposited via a cheque into the account on March 24, 2014

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The witness said the RM63,800 was a normal transaction that was not suspicious because it was not a large amount for a company account

                On Tuesday, a witness in Zahid’s trial testified that RM2.6 million in political donations was given to Bersatu, the party which was formerly chaired by Mahathir
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                David Tan, UKSB’s former administrative manager, said the sum was passed to Rahmat after Pakatan Harapan (PH) won the 2018 general election and Mahathir was appointed the prime minister for the second time

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rahmat said in a statement that the witness’ testimony was false and defamatory

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                “What will happen to the bill if Parliament is dissolved before it is passed?”, asked Hassan Karim (PH-Pasir Gudang) while debating the anti-hopping bill
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Is there enough time to pass the bill in both Houses (Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara) as well as to present it to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong for his assent?” Hassan urged Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob and law minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar to guarantee that the dissolution of Parliament would not stop the bill from being enacted
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The current Parliament’s term is until July 16 next year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A political agreement signed between Ismail’s government and Pakatan Harapan (PH) last September states that the next general election cannot be held before July 31

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The agreement means that Parliament cannot be dissolved before then

                Larry Sng (PBM-Julau) said the proposed bill would put independent MPs at a disadvantage because they would have to vacate their seats should they join a party

                “How is the ministry measuring the progress of the national strategic plan (in handling the causes of child marriage)? “What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the six factors outlined in the plan?” the Kampung Tunku assemblyman said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to the national plan, the six factors are low household income and poverty; lack of access to sexual reproductive health education and parenting skills; lack of access to education and poor school attendance; stigma on child marriages to address problems; vague laws that provide for marriage under the age of 18; and coordination of marital data and underage divorce
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim also called on the ministry to provide figures on the number of child marriages in 2021, noting reports that such unions had taken place despite the Covid-19 pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim went on to chide the ministry’s response to PKR MP Maria Chin Abdullah as “generic”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The minister and her deputy should tackle child marriages more aggressively instead of providing generic written replies in Parliament.” The national plan was launched by then deputy prime minister Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who was also women, family and community development minister, in 2020

                Nazlan, now a Court of Appeal judge, had sentenced Isa to six years’ jail and fined him RM15.4 million on Feb 3, 2021 after finding him guilty on nine counts of corruption involving RM3.09 million in connection with Felda’s purchase of a hotel in Kuching in 2014

                With the formation of Malaysia in 1963, Malaysia then continued making such annual payments and without interruption until 2013
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Thomas said the Sulu claimants are not entitled at all to make such an argument over what Sabah is worth now in 2022, as the Sulu sultan had already given away Sabah when he signed the 1878 documents and no longer owns these lands
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Thomas also alleged that the Spanish arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa — whose appointment as arbitrator had been challenged by Malaysia — was a “rogue” arbitrator who had “rewrote” the 1878 document when deciding on February 28, 2022 to order Malaysia to pay US$14.9 billion to the eight Sulu claimants

                Even while disputing the entire arbitration, Thomas also said the US$14.9 billion award was made against the government of Malaysia and which means only Malaysia’s assets can be subject to execution

                The award does not bind Petronas, and cannot be enforced against the assets of Petronas,” Thomas said of the US$14.9 billion award

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To another question, Zarul Ahmad told the court he was instructed by Lim to issue media statements for the purpose of discrediting a RM22 million graft allegation levelled against the company back in July 2018
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim is facing an amended charge of using his position as Penang chief minister back then to receive a bribe of RM3.3 million in helping the company owned by Zarul Ahmad to obtain a construction project worth RM6,341,383,702

                Azli had told the court last month that what Zarul asked him and Ibrahim to process from 2012 to 2017 were bribes to Lim

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Today, Zarul said he knew that using fake payment vouchers and invoices was a criminal offence

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim is standing trial on charges of using his position as then Penang chief minister to ask Zarul for a 10% cut of the profits from the undersea tunnel project and accepting RM3.3 million in kickbacks from the businessman

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Zarul also told the court that Lim instructed him to give statements to the media, after Zarul was released from Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) detention

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court had heard that between 2013 and 2014, Zarul paid a total of RM200,000 to Lim to “fulfil” part of his promise to give him a 10% cut of the project’s profits

                In a parliamentary written reply, Rina said the statistics department reported 1,856 child marriages in 2018, which went down to 1,459 in 2019 and reduced further to 1,124 in 2020
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She said this proved that child marriages were seeing a downward trend, though she did not share any data on the number of child marriages recorded last year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Responding to a question from Maria Chin Abdullah (PH-Petaling Jaya), Rina said her ministry was implementing its national strategic plan in handling the causes of child marriage, which involves the federal and state governments, NGOs and international organisations
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She said the strategic plan looked at issues across various sectors, such as the law, education, health, parenting, social support and poverty eradication in addressing child marriages at the grassroots level

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She said the ministry has formed a steering committee to monitor the implementation of the strategic plan, which will go on until 2025

                THE Thai authorities have apprehended wanted Malaysian fugitive Tedy Teow Wooi Huat after police there cracked down on gambling syndicates in Southern Thailand
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to Thai police, Teow is believed to be the major financier for online gambling rings in the kingdom

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The final straw for Malaysian authorities came in 2021 was when police busted a huge Macau syndicate and linked it to Teow and his two sons as their main suspects

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to the police, the syndicate would get victims to transfer money to a mule account which they would then syphon off into other accounts

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 -- The highly controversial Independent Police Conduct Commission (IPCC) Bill 2020 has been passed in Parliament after being tabled by Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainuddin for its second reading today
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The IPCC Bill was tabled for its first reading in the Dewan Rakyat by then Deputy Home Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Mohamed Said in August 2020
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The IPCC Bill was introduced to replace the Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission (IPCMC) Bill that was tabled in Parliament by the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government in 2019
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The IPCMC Bill had proposed that "the Commission may initiate investigations notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the Commission may commence an investigation on its own initiative but only if the Commission is satisfied that the subject matter of the investigation is of significant interest to the public or that it is in the public interest to do so whether or not there is a complaint of misconduct relating to it”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Other recommendations removed under the IPCC include suggested disciplinary jurisdiction over any misconduct committed by any member of the police force and the powers to exercise disciplinary jurisdiction over any complaint concerning the misconduct of any member of the police force
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It added that the IPCC will further weaken the already inadequate oversight mechanism, the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission (EAIC), when Malaysia is in desperate need of an independent commission overseeing the police.

                In submitting a memorandum on the issue to the home ministry, outside the Parliament building, the PKR-backed group said 68% of commercial crimes since May 2020 involved online scams

                Nunukan Immigration officer Lukie Reza Kusumah said that their investigations have begun to see if the three foreigners had violated Indonesia's immigration law under Article 122 for abusing their visit pass to carry out business
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The three were arrested with three other Indonesians including one suspect who allegedly had both Indonesian and Malaysian identity documents

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Initial investigations showed that the three together with their Indonesian counterparts were apparently taking pictures around the naval installations on the Indonesian side of Sebatik for the closest location for building a bridge from Sebatik to mainland Tawau
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nunukan Immigration officials said that the trio should be using a business visa and not tourists or visit visas

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                No decision has yet been made on whether the three would be charged for the immigration offence as investigations were still in progress

                On Monday (July 25), Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin reminded all health facilities to be aware of the current monkeypox situation and increase case detection among patients at risk following the announcement by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that the infection was now a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)

                Khairy said that the disruption of supply was due to the total lockdown in China where most of the supply for active ingredients for pharmaceutical products are produced and the Russia-Ukraine war where an ingredient which is added to the active ingredient was produced

                To ensure the country's drug security and self-reliance in times of crisis, local pharmaceutical companies are encouraged to produce their own active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) through public-private partnerships

                In addition to that, Khairy added that the ministry would also advocate pharmaceutical product patency by strengthening its cooperation with the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia to prevent patent ever-greening
