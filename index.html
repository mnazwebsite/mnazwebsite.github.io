                Love you mum and dad, now and forever." Aloysius Fong repeated these sentiments in Newcastle Crown Court on Friday (Aug 12) before his father was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder

                The application, which was filed on July 16, sought various amendments to the substantive notice of motion filed two months ago seeking the admission of fresh evidence to Najib’s SRC International corruption appeal which he says shows that judge Nazlan Ghazali presided over the trial while under a “serious conflict of interest”

                They have until August 31 to complete and agree to the terms, or risk losing out on access to Malaysia's 5G single wholesale network being rolled out rapidly now by the Ministry of Finance owned DNB

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The other four companies — Celcom, DiGi, YTL and Telekom Malaysia — agreed earlier to take up shares in DNB that were offered to them by the government
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also pointed out that while the six Malaysian telcos have agreed to take up shares in DNB, a full completion of the deal can only happen once they agree to the access terms by August 31
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                But the stakes are contingent on the former companies agreeing access terms with DNB

                DNB was established in early March 2021 to accelerate deployment of 5G infrastructure and network in Malaysia

                BUSINESS owners and workers in Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman are divided over Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s (DBKL) plan to close the busy road to traffic every Sunday

                The road closure spans from Sogo KL shopping centre at the Jalan Esfahan junction towards Panggung Bandaraya in Jalan Tun Perak

                He added that DBKL was also studying proposals to do the same at a stretch between Jalan Pudu and Jalan Bukit Bintang

                Textile shop worker Hartina Lanivi, 32, welcomed the plan to turn part of Jalan TAR into a pedestrian zone, but was against allowing buskers to perform along the two-lane road

                Earlier this month, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said that Malaysia will find it a challenge to avoid an economic recession next year

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nevertheless, Tengku Zafrul is confident that Malaysia will have positive economic growth at least until the third quarter of this year and emphasised that the country must be prepared for a slowdown in the global economy

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Malaysia blindly followed the anti-scientific world trend and now finds itself sharing that same fate.” Ferlito said Malaysia’s economic recovery so far has been driven by private consumption and government spending
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “For the future, I expect Malaysia’s economic growth to be even more fragile, as government spending will have to slow down if we want to seriously tackle inflation.” Ferlito said inflation may slow down private consumption and that external trade may suffer due to the global uncertainties

                Wanita BN leader Noraini Ahmad said the movement appealed to the government to amend the Federal Constitution so that the meaning of the word “father” in the citizenship clause be extended to include “mother” or be changed to the word “parents”

                As of Friday, more than 202 million Indonesians had received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines, some 170.4 million had been jabbed with a second dose and around 58.2 million had received a third shot

                Pandu said the highest increase in antibody titer was observed among respondents who had received a booster dose, with an average of 4,496 units per millilitre

                Indonesia’s monthly vaccine rollout has been decreasing significantly since March of this year, with the government attributing the slowdown to increasing vaccine hesitancy among the public due to the improving Covid-19 situation
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The government managed to increase its vaccine rollout to around 7.7 million doses after the mandatory booster regulation was in place, however, average daily vaccinations still hover at around 250,000 per day, much lower than the around one million shots administered per day achieved earlier this year

                Lorry driver Saffri Kamaruddin, 50, admitted that his EPF savings would not be enough to sustain him after retirement in view of the rising cost of living
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said he planned to use whatever he has as EPF savings as capital to run a business
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A factory worker, known as Krishnan, 55, said he has increased his monthly contribution to EPF to ensure his savings will be enough when he retires
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If it’s not enough, then I will have to work after retiring
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Meanwhile, a consultant at an aviation school, Zulfadli Halim, 50, said that the hike in the cost of living has made it difficult for him to increase his monthly contribution to EPF and he was worried about his future

                “EPF members’ savings are at a low and very worrying level, especially after the four withdrawals and the reduction in the employee share of the statutory contribution rate,” he said, adding that as of June 30, 6.62 million members — or 52% of the total of 12.78 million EPF members aged under 55 — had savings of less than RM10,000

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The PSB president revealed today that as its candidate in the Sarawak state elections last December, See signed a contract that required him to quit from the state assembly if he chose to resign from the party having won the seat under the PSB ticket
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said See’s resignation from the party, as announced by Sarawak state assembly Speaker Asfia Awang Nasar earlier today, would mean he must now vacate his seat
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “See is fully aware of the commitments, both oral and written, that he had given to PSB before he was selected to be the PSB candidate for Batu Lintang,” Wong said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Noting that See was a senior lawyer, Wong said the now independent assemblyman knew what he committed to in writing before he was chosen as a candidate for the state constituency
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As a matter of principle, PSB will avail itself of all necessary actions and remedies in respect of the commitments made by See.” Aside from vacating his seat, Wong said the agreement also included an undertaking to compensate the party if See quit the party after enjoying the benefit of PSB’s resources in getting elected
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Deputy chief minister Bung Moktar Radin said this is one of the main reasons behind high unemployment and poverty rates in the state

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that the state government was sensitive to the situation where the completion of infrastructure projects, especially the construction of the Pan Borneo Highway, is an important effort to attract investors and further stimulate the state’s economic development

            <p> </p>

                Bung Moktar, who is state works minister, was asked to comment on the latest economic report which states that Sabah has one of the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Kinabatangan MP said that the state government had also asked Putrajaya to increase the number of work packages for the highway construction project for implementation next year in order to speed up the completion of the Pan Borneo Highway

                About Us Advertise ASHTON KEYNES, Aug 14 — At the end of a dusty track in southwest England where the River Thames usually first emerges from the ground, there is currently scant sign of any moisture at all

                The driest start to a year in decades has shifted the source of this emblematic English river several miles downstream, leaving scorched earth and the occasional puddle where water once flowed

                "We haven't found the Thames yet," confided Michael Sanders, 62, on holiday with his wife in the area known as the official source of the river

                He also countered their criticism of the delays in the project by asking “What about year 2020 (Covid)? Year 2021 (Covid)?”, a period of pandemic lockdowns, when the project was suspended
            </p>

                Najib said former defence minister Mohamad Sabu and his deputy Liew Chin Tong had previously said it was not the former PH government that ordered the project to stop but that Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) had run out of funds to continue the project

                US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday that Beijing’s unprecedented military drills around Taiwan after her trip to the island last week have upended a long-standing status quo in the region, and that her visit was being used by Beijing merely as a “pretext” to act more aggressively
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This week, Taiwan’s foreign minister Joseph Wu also said that Beijing was using Pelosi’s trip as a pretext to prepare for a future invasion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, Washington also maintains an unofficial relationship with Taipei and sells Taiwan arms to defend itself

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under official US policy, Washington does not recognise Beijing’s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan but “acknowledges” that the claim exists

                I don’t see why we should celebrate ‘Merdeka Day’

                “I would celebrate the independence day of Sarawak, and we celebrated it grandly in Sibu this year, and I support it.” For Sarawak People’s Aspiration Party (Aspirasi) president Lina Soo, August 31, 1957 was the date Malaya was granted independence from Britain, opining that it had nothing to do with Sarawak

                John reportedly said Sabah PKR members were hoping for Anwar to resolve the problem of the existence of two camps there — one which was aligned with then Sabah PKR chief Christina Liew, and another one aligned with PKR Keningau division chief Datuk Sangkar Rasam and the latter's nephew and former Sabah PKR youth chief and current Pensiangan PKR division chief Raymond Ahuar
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Anwar on August 6 announced that Sangkar would replace Liew as Sabah PKR chief
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                John reportedly said he was not questioning the decision to change the Sabah PKR chief as it was the PKR president's prerogative to do so, but said this was the "wrong timing" and that the party's focus should instead be on the 15th general election (GE15) which he said was just around the corner
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                These were the only two seats that PKR had won in Sabah in the general elections in 2018, with Liew winning the Tawau seat then
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Liew is currently also the Api-Api state assemblyman and was formerly deputy chief minister of Sabah, and had been a PKR member for the past 20 years and had been the Sabah PKR chief since October 2016
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to The Star, Sangkar had last December led 16 Sabah PKR division chiefs in calling for Anwar to drop Liew as Sabah PKR chief

                "Is Malaysia’s stronger than expected 2022 second-quarter growth of 8.9 per cent due to the extraordinary increase in private sector consumption and investment of 18.3 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively following the one-off Employees Provident Fund (EPF) special withdrawals of RM10,000 disbursed in April 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, Malaysia was announced to have recorded a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2022 when compared to the same quarter in 2021
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim noted that private sector consumption in Malaysia only grew by 5.5 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022, in contrast to the 18.9 per cent year-on-year growth in the second quarter of 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "If the RM44 billion from the RM10,000 one-off special EPF withdrawal did not generate the 18.3 per cent jump in private sector consumption for the second quarter, Bank Negara should determine the source of the increase
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim said there was concern about whether Malaysia's second-quarter economic growth is too reliant on firm domestic demand, particularly the RM44 billion one-off special EPF withdrawals
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Since there will be no more RM44 billion one-off EPF special withdrawals in the pipeline, Malaysia’s economic growth will depend on external demand, which is subject to slower global growth," he said
