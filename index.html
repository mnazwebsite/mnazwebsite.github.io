                You may notice grenade launchers like Anarchy are currently unavailable  Some Destiny 2 heavy grenade launchers are currently disabled following reports that they were bugged and doling out impossibly high damage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of writing, it seems that a select 150 RPM and 120 RPM heavy grenade launchers are disabled, while others are still available for use
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For instance, Anarchy and Canis Major are currently unable to be equipped, while breach-load GLs like Forbearance and some heavy 150 RPM GLs like Outrageous Fortune can still be used
            </p>
            
            <p>
                YouTuber Aztecross posted a video earlier today (opens in new tab) of a grenade launcher damage test that shows some heavy launchers doling out +150% more damage than usual
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two shots of the Anarchy grenade launcher did more than 242,000 damage, which is definitely not normal

            <p>
                For instance, Anarchy and Canis Major are currently unable to be equipped, while breach-load GLs like Forbearance and some heavy 150 RPM GLs like Outrageous Fortune can still be used
            </p>
            
            <p>
                YouTuber Aztecross posted a video earlier today (opens in new tab) of a grenade launcher damage test that shows some heavy launchers doling out +150% more damage than usual
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two shots of the Anarchy grenade launcher did more than 242,000 damage, which is definitely not normal

                Samsung has announced a new version of its flagship PCIe SSD, dubbed the 990 Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only does the PCIe 4.0 M.2 storage device get even closer to being as fast as it can theoretically be, but there’s also the option of getting it with a heatsink that comes complete with RGB lighting (though, if you get that version to upgrade a PlayStation 5, which requires add-on SSDs to have a heatsink, those lights will likely get lost behind a layer of textured plastic)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Impressive as it is, the performance jump isn’t anywhere near what we saw from the 970 Pro to the 980 Pro when Samsung upgraded from PCIe 3.0 to 4.0
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Samsung didn’t immediately answer The Verge’s question on how it was able to squeeze even more speed out of its SSDs without upgrading to a newer version of PCIe, but its press release does mention that the 990 Pro has a “newly designed controller” handling the task of actually reading and writing bits to and from the NAND flash chips
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s even true if you’re looking to upgrade the somewhat picky PS5; Samsung sells a version of the 980 with the required heatsink

                While its return would be cool, it’d be better to see the game headline the PS Plus September 2022 selection

            <p>
                Mass Effect Legendary Edition has recently been featured in several free game promotions on other platforms, so it wouldn’t be a surprise to see it also making an appearance in the PS Plus September 2022 lineup

            <p>
                And because every Notion page is just a URL, and you can use the Stream Deck’s software to get a button to open any webpage, you can turn your Stream Deck into an index of all your most important stuff

                PlayStation 5's pro controller is finally revealed

            <p>
                The DualSense Edge Wireless Controller is the latest hardware from Sony, and it's, well… ugly
            </p>

                Clearly the DualSense Edge has been in the works for some time and its design has not been taken lightly at Sony
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Targeted at an elite gamer who needs to adjust the controller to their needs the DualSense Edge is pure function over form
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm being a little harsh on Sony's entry into the pro gamer space for PS5; considering you can break the DualSense Edge down and adjust it to how you need it to work, it does remain a sleek controller but with a new industrial, well… edge

The high-end Apple Watch will reportedly feature the first new design since the launch of the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2018

                The successor to the Galaxy A03, it retains some of the same aesthetics from the smartphone but with some refinements and a specs bump.  According to Samsung’s press release, the Galaxy A04 is powered by an unnamed octa-core processor under the hood which is believed to be the company’s own Exynos 850 SoC

                There’s no 5G connectivity, unfortunately, whereby the Galaxy A04 only supports 4G

            <p>
                Given the specs of the device, we expect it to be priced well below RM1000 and should be a competitive offering in the affordable smartphone segment.  What do you guys think?

                Asus launched the ROG Phone 6 series back in July, and the Pro phone quickly took the AnTuTu crown by the end of the month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now another version appeared online with slightly better benchmark results, and reports are the new device will be called ROG Phone 6D, powered by a Dimensity 9000+
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The score of 1,146,594 for the phone with model number ASUS_AI2203_D may be unofficial and an outlier in AnTuTu terms, but it is still 2-3% more than the very same ROG Phone 6 Pro, powered by a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asus is still staying silent on any new ROG phone launches but we expect the 6D to arrive soon, as the device was already certified at 3C with 65W fast charging

            <p>
                The ability to retrieve deleted messages, according to the report, will only be for the messages that you delete for yourself (delete for me), not the messages that you “delete for everyone." A snack bar will show up informing users that the message has been erased and they can undo it

                The Meta-owned instant messaging app is also said to be bringing the ability for group admins to delete any message for everyone in a group

            <p>
                This feature, which seems to have been inspired from Slack, is a little different from what we find in Slack, where a group admin can delete a message without anyone knowing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In WhatsApp members of the group will be shown a message, that would read “This message has been deleted by a group admin.” Although it is not known when the feature will go live for all users, given that it has been released in a few selected beta versions, it would be safe to assume that in an upcoming update in the near future, this feature gets rolled out

            <p>
                The ability to retrieve deleted messages, according to the report, will only be for the messages that you delete for yourself (delete for me), not the messages that you “delete for everyone." A snack bar will show up informing users that the message has been erased and they can undo it

                The Meta-owned instant messaging app is also said to be bringing the ability for group admins to delete any message for everyone in a group

            <p>
                This feature, which seems to have been inspired from Slack, is a little different from what we find in Slack, where a group admin can delete a message without anyone knowing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In WhatsApp members of the group will be shown a message, that would read “This message has been deleted by a group admin.” Although it is not known when the feature will go live for all users, given that it has been released in a few selected beta versions, it would be safe to assume that in an upcoming update in the near future, this feature gets rolled out

                Earlier this month, we reported that iPadOS 16 may potentially be delayed and not be released together with iOS 16
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, Apple themselves have come out with a statement to confirm the matter, saying that iPadOS 16 won’t be getting a public release until after iOS 16 has been rolled out to supported iPhones.  Previously, reliable tipster Mark Gurman claimed that for the first time in years, Apple will not be releasing the iPadOS update in September or at the same time as the iOS update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like many of Gurman’s predictions, the claim turns out to be true as today, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS 16 will indeed be delayed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another peculiar thing is that Apple will be releasing an update directly to iPadOS 16.1 instead of iPadOS 16
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company released iPadOS 16.1 beta to enrolled developers earlier today
            </p>

                Bandai Namco Entertainment Asia has just released a new gameplay trailer for Park Beyond which is set to be released in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X & S and PC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The trailer shows off characters from the game’s campaign who are busy making their craziest ideas a reality and giving more insight into modular building with extensive customisation to create a fully personalised park
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Developed by studio Limbic Entertainment, Park Beyond is a brand-new take on theme park management simulation games and as a visionary architect, players will take on the fantastic task of building and managing every detail of their own amusement park with a twist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While creating rides for their parks, players will soon discover there is no such thing as impossible in Park Beyond with the game’s Impossification feature, which is a concept where technology, money and gravity are no insurmountable obstacles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Park Beyond will feature thousands of assets that are split into various themes such as a Western theme, a DaVinci theme, Candyville and others which let players design entire themed districts in their park or mix and match any elements for a close to infinite number of possibilities
            </p>

                Just follow these simple steps to revert back to the old design -   However, it would be best if you prepare yourself to use the new design interface

                Moreover, there will come a time when Google will simply not let users switch to the old design

                Fitbit's launch event teaser Fitbit has teased a launch event due to take place today, on August 24 at 6am PT
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fitbit wrote “be sure to check back tomorrow at 6am PT” in response to a user who asked “when can I get the Fitbit Sense 2” and “we hear you” to another fan who commented that they want a new Fitbit with a physical button
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So is that it? Fitbit is to announce a Sense 2 watch at 6am PT, and it will have a physical button? To me the teaser image seems to show a watch with a capacitive button, just like the original Sense — because it looks more concave than convex
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The biggest news here, though, is that the Fitbit Sense 2 is likely to be the first Fitbit watch powered by WearOS, something Fitbit has talked about ever since it was acquired by Google in early 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its timing means the Fitbit Sense 2 will arrive long before the Pixel Watch, which is expected in October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also a chance Fitbit will announce not one but two new lines today, with the Fitbit Versa 4

                To recap, the smartwatch sports a 1.8-inch LCD display with a peak brightness of 500 nits, making it about 35% larger than the Watch 2

            <p>
                The battery life of the device is a bit odd, because despite having slightly bigger 340mAh battery compared to its predecessor’s 315mAh capacity, it only has a seven-day battery life, almost half of the Watch 2’s 12-day usage claim

                This comes after the Federal Court yesterday affirmed former prime minister Najib Razak’s conviction and sentence in the SRC International case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                SRC International was a former 1MDB subsidiary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “DAP urges the government to redouble (their) efforts to nab Jho Low, his family and associates connected with the RM52 billion 1MDB scandal to bring justice to 32 million Malaysians robbed by the biggest heist in history,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said it is “manifestly unfair and a travesty of justice” that Low, his family and associates connected with the scandal are allowed to roam free while Najib has had his day in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No expense or effort should be spared to bring to book Jho Low, his family and associates for robbing Malaysians of tens of billions of ringgit in the 1MDB scandal,” said the former finance minister and Penang chief minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low, described as the mastermind behind the 1MDB scandal, has been on the run since 2018, and Interpol has issued red notices for his arrest

            <p>
                This comes after the Federal Court yesterday affirmed former prime minister Najib Razak’s conviction and sentence in the SRC International case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                SRC International was a former 1MDB subsidiary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “DAP urges the government to redouble (their) efforts to nab Jho Low, his family and associates connected with the RM52 billion 1MDB scandal to bring justice to 32 million Malaysians robbed by the biggest heist in history,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said it is “manifestly unfair and a travesty of justice” that Low, his family and associates connected with the scandal are allowed to roam free while Najib has had his day in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No expense or effort should be spared to bring to book Jho Low, his family and associates for robbing Malaysians of tens of billions of ringgit in the 1MDB scandal,” said the former finance minister and Penang chief minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low, described as the mastermind behind the 1MDB scandal, has been on the run since 2018, and Interpol has issued red notices for his arrest
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                On Aug 22, FMT reported that an emergency meeting of all Umno division leaders was held at Menara Dato Onn to discuss candidate selection for the coming general election (GE15)

                According to party leader Jamal Yunos, some 158 Umno division leaders had called for GE15 to be held immediately

            <p>
                The Sungai Besar Umno chief said the demand would be relayed to Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob by Zahid at the next Supreme Council meeting

                The general election has to be held by September next year, but some Umno leaders have pressed for it to be called this year, following convincing victories for Barisan Nasional in recent state elections

                According to sources, Huawei actually submitted a patent called "Aperture, Camera Module and Electronic Device" last year

            <p>
                In the patent image above, you can see that there is a 6-blade aperture and it's very likely that it could be used in the Mate 50 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As aforementioned, the Huawei Mate 50 looks incomplete at the moment due to the exposed rear camera design

            <p>
                It may look ordinary and obviously, the Mate 50 in the photo looks like a prototype
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to sources, Huawei actually submitted a patent called "Aperture, Camera Module and Electronic Device" last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the patent image above, you can see that there is a 6-blade aperture and it's very likely that it could be used in the Mate 50 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As aforementioned, the Huawei Mate 50 looks incomplete at the moment due to the exposed rear camera design
            </p>

                Let’s start with the WRX

            <p>
                Subaru’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system is standard, and customers can choose between a six-speed manual transmission or a CVT dubbed Subaru Performance Transmission
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The WRX is offered in a total of nine colours, including Ceramic White, Crystal White Pearl, Ice Silver Metallic, Magnetite Grey Metallic, Crystal Black Silica, Sapphire Blue Pearl, World Rally Blue Pearl, Solar Orange Pearl and Ignition Red
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the WRX Wagon, it’s essentially a second-generation Levorg with the WRX powertrain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Known as the WRX Sportswagon in Australia and the WRX GT Wagon in New Zealand, the more practical offering only comes with a CVT and is actually priced less than the WRX at 2.959 million baht (RM367,012)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The engine specifications and kit list of the WRX Wagon in Thailand are pretty much identical to the most expensive WRX variant, although the colour choices are reduced to just eight, with Solar Orange Pearl being the absentee

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 24 — Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak could write to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah in a bid for clemency over his conviction in the SRC International Sdn Bhd corruption case, but he will have to serve time first, former attorney-general (AG) Tan Sri Abu Talib Othman reportedly said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abu Talib was a prosecutor in the late 1970s when the late former Selangor chief minister Datuk Harun Idris was convicted for corruption and the AG in 1982 when the late former culture, youth and sports minister Datuk Mokhtar Hashim was convicted for the murder of Datuk Mohamad Taha Talib, the then-speaker of Negri Sembilan legislative assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also reportedly said that the Agong must act on advice despite the power of pardon being vested in him and that the decisions of any pardons board are currently beyond review by courts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The royal pardon falls under Article 42(1) of the Federal Constitution, which gives the Agong or Sultan the powers to grant a pardon or reprieve to a convict, wiping clean any legal punishments to provide a "clean slate”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Najib failed in his final appeal against the High Court's guilty conviction, which saw the Federal Court ordering him to serve his 12-year sentence with immediate effect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat said that the findings of the High Court on the defence were correct and that the learned trial judge had undertaken a thorough analysis of the evidence produced by the defence, correctly evaluating all the evidence led in relation to the defence and did not believe the defence narrative

                On Nov 29, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reportedly said that the republic was open to any new proposal from Malaysia on the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore HSR although both countries had earlier agreed to terminate the project

            <p>
                On Jan 1, 2021, Malaysia and Singapore jointly announced the termination of the HSR project as no agreement was reached on the changes proposed by Malaysia and the fact that the agreement had expired on Dec 31, 2020

            <p>
                On March 2021, Malaysia announced that it had paid S$102.8mil (RM330.3mil) to Singapore for the cost incurred by the republic for the development of HSR and the delays involved

                The Prime Minister said the government was also looking into the need for a third link between Johor and Singapore to reduce the congestion at the Johor Causeway and the Second Link (Linkedua)

                At first glance, this looks like a refreshed Realme GT Neo 2 but it now supports a blazing-fast 80W SuperDart fast charging
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Realme GT Neo 3T with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage is officially priced at RM1,799 in Malaysia

                On top of that, the first 200 customers will also get the Realme Watch 3 which retails for RM259
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, the hardware of the GT Neo 3T looks identical to last year’s GT Neo 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Realme, the GT Neo 3T can achieve a 50% charge in just 12 minutes on the cable
            </p>

                Tilt Five, a startup founded by a former Valve engineer, has just announced that a 3D holographic version of the game, dubbed Catan — Tilt Five AR, will arrive in spring 2023

                Ellsworth’s original company, CastAR, shut down in 2017, but she brought it back two years later as Tilt Five with the help of a second Kickstarter campaign, and the company’s website suggests it has 21 games so far

                One of the biggest hurdles for an indie game system like this is generating enough momentum to get off the ground

                If you don’t have enough of the right games, it’s hard to sell systems; if you don’t have enough systems sold, it’s hard to attract game developers

            <p>
                It also currently requires a Windows PC to power the game, with Android phone support promised later

                This new malware acts like an app store to bypass Android 13 restrictions In Android 13, Google introduces new security measures to help protect users from malicious apps and other dangerous malware
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the post, the exploit can allow a malicious app to appear as an app store so that it can bypass Android 13's new security measures
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now if you download an app from outside of an official app store, it will be harder for that app to access your contacts to spread spam or appear over other apps
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All apps downloaded from the Play Store or third-party app stores like F-Droid, or the Amazon App Store are exempt from this restriction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Allowing apps downloaded from official app stores to access accessibility services in Android 13 makes sense as, just like Google does on the Play Store, other official stores screen new apps to ensure they aren’t malicious by carefully checking their code
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First things first, you should never sideload apps on your Android smartphone and should instead download them from official app stores

                Cheras district police chief Zam Halim Jamaluddin said the post by Zamani Ibrahim was a personal political opinion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zam said a report was lodged about Zamani’s Facebook post on Aug 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that Zamani’s post became viral after it was circulated by irresponsible parties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier today, Najib filed an application to recuse Tengku Maimun from hearing the appeal on grounds that Zamani had “negative sentiments” towards his leadership, which the latter had expressed in a Facebook post in the aftermath of the 14th general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the post, Zamani spoke about the fall of the Barisan Nasional government on May 9, 2018, and that he was “happy because Najib had been dethroned”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Tengku Maimun said her husband’s Facebook post four years ago had no “nexus” to the SRC International case, adding that Najib was only charged in July that year

            <p>
                Both Wright and Hope were reporters in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) who reported in 2015 on RM2.6 billion allegedly channelled into Najib’s bank account from the 1MDB funds

                Wright made the statement in a Twitter thread following news that the Federal Court had affirmed former prime minister Najib Razak’s conviction and sentence in the SRC International case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the decision, Najib has become the first former prime minister in the country to be jailed
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>

                Both Wright and Hope were reporters in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) who reported in 2015 on RM2.6 billion allegedly channelled into Najib’s bank account from the 1MDB funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib, who is the former Pekan MP, will begin serving his jail term immediately

            <p>
                He then appealed the conviction to the appellate court, which upheld the High Court’s decision in December last year

                Rafizi said there was “enough evidence” to back his claim that the woman, Zainab Mohd Salleh, was Abd Latiff Ahmad’s wife
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The evidence, he said, could be found in a recently declassified audit report by Boustead Heavy Industries Corp naming Zainab as Latiff’s wife as well as the pair’s connection to offshore companies linked to the project

                Yesterday, Rafizi claimed that Latiff’s “wife” was the owner of two companies that had siphoned funds from the LCS project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said the schemes to misappropriate LCS funds using companies allegedly linked to Latiff, who was the then deputy defence minister, was no coincidence

                As Tuesday’s (Aug 23) session resumed after a brief recess, Najib's counsel Hisyam Teh Poh Teik informed the Federal Court panel that Shafee would be joining him in submitting the defence’s application to recuse the panel’s chairperson Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Springing into action 10 minutes later, Shafee informed the court that he was just informed of the defence’s application hours ago, and that he would only be submitting on a part of the application, while Hisyam will submit on the other grounds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee contended that he was ill-prepared to submit to the court on Tuesday, due to how late he was informed of the application, and with him being occupied with a symposium in Parliament, he asked the court for an adjournment until Wednesday morning to allow him to submit on the application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Chief Justice quipped to Shafee that the senior lawyer basically came to the court on Tuesday to seek an adjournment, to which Shafee answered in the affirmative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Tengku Maimun swiftly struck down the defence’s request for an adjournment, and told Hisyam to proceed with his submissions for the recusal application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hisyam then proceeded with submissions on the recusal application, while Shafee exited the courtroom to attend to matters in Parliament

                Manchester United ran 19km more against Liverpool than in the poor 4-0 defeat to Brentford United had a much higher success rate than Liverpool in duels, as they made 11 more tackles It wasn't only about the distance United covered, they made a huge total of 155 sprints compared to the 65 that they made against the Bees.  The high-pressing style of play led to plenty more interceptions as they had 12, double Jurgen Klopp's side total of six during the match
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those goals came despite a lack of possession with just 29.6 per cent against Liverpool while they had 67 per cent against Brentford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United saw Raphael Varane, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot booked in the victory at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This week, the free-kick count was only 11-7 against the hosts.  United also only mustered two corners last time out and improved that total to six in the win over Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United improved their discipline, although Bruno Fernandes was booked in both matches United made a total of 273 passes, 57 being long passes, with a passing accuracy of 65.9 per cent during the win over title challengers Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A key statistic being the passing accuracy in the opponents' half which was a total of 53.6 per cent while they only had a 12.5 per cent crossing accuracy in their total of eight crosses.  It's crazy what difference a week can make and of course a few tweaks with the former Ajax manager making the bold decision to drop captain Harry Maguire and superstar forward Cristiano Ronaldo from the starting line-up

                Manchester United ran 19km more against Liverpool than in the poor 4-0 defeat to Brentford United had a much higher success rate than Liverpool in duels, as they made 11 more tackles It wasn't only about the distance United covered, they made a huge total of 155 sprints compared to the 65 that they made against the Bees.  The high-pressing style of play led to plenty more interceptions as they had 12, double Jurgen Klopp's side total of six during the match
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those goals came despite a lack of possession with just 29.6 per cent against Liverpool while they had 67 per cent against Brentford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United saw Raphael Varane, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot booked in the victory at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This week, the free-kick count was only 11-7 against the hosts.  United also only mustered two corners last time out and improved that total to six in the win over Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United improved their discipline, although Bruno Fernandes was booked in both matches United made a total of 273 passes, 57 being long passes, with a passing accuracy of 65.9 per cent during the win over title challengers Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A key statistic being the passing accuracy in the opponents' half which was a total of 53.6 per cent while they only had a 12.5 per cent crossing accuracy in their total of eight crosses.  It's crazy what difference a week can make and of course a few tweaks with the former Ajax manager making the bold decision to drop captain Harry Maguire and superstar forward Cristiano Ronaldo from the starting line-up

                According to the FCC listing, the Sony Xperia 5 IV measures at 155.74 mm in length and 67.1 mm in width, while its display is recorded at 153.5mm – equivalent to 6.04-inches
            </p>

                Surprisingly, this suggests that the fourth iteration of the smartphone is slightly smaller than its predecessor, which measures at 6.1-inches

                Mahathir sought a full royal pardon for his former ally after they joined forces to win the elections that year, on the back of public anger on Najib’s handling of 1MDB

                Penang PAS committee member Abdul Razib Abd Rahim said the state committee supported the central committee’s ummah unification agenda
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Penang is well known for being the heartland of Pakatan Harapan (PH)-DAP, so the agenda of unifying Malay parties is even more important here to prevent PH from taking advantage of any split in Malay-Muslim votes,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The slogan ‘Islam unites the ummah’ should be backed by all PAS supporters, so that efforts to unite Malay political parties are successful and in line with shariah and party policy.” Razib said the parties, which he did not name, must be committed towards this cause to ensure Malay-Muslim interests were not denied and neglected in Penang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Penang PAS calls for all parties to forgo their personal interests in GE15, and ensure that the Malay-Muslim vote can be united for the well-being and harmony of the people,” he said

                The court had set Aug 15 to 19 and Aug 23 to 26 to hear the appeal

            <p>

            <p>
                On Aug 16, the court dismissed Hisyam's application to postpone the appeal hearing and ordered the appeal to proceed on Aug 18

            <p>
                Last year, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision and dismissed Najib's appeal to set aside his conviction and jail sentence as well as the fine

                Rafizi said, in a statement, he received this information from internal investigations into the LCS scandal and from cross-checking with the database of offshore companies in the Paradise Papers, a 2017 tranche of leaked confidential records related to offshore investments

                He added that it would have been impossible for then Finance Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and then Defence Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to not have known about this as it occurred with projects that they both managed

                Last Thursday, Rafizi claimed that RM192 million had been funnelled from the LCS project to nonexistent, untraceable offshore accounts

                About Us Advertise LONDON, Aug 22 — Prince William and his wife Kate announced today that they will send all three of their children to the same private school after moving their main home to Windsor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kensington Palace said that from September third-in-line Prince George, aged nine, Princess Charlotte, seven, and four-year-old Prince Louis will attend Lambrook School, near Ascot in southern England
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The announcement came as the family are shifting their base from their London apartment at Kensington Palace to Adelaide Cottage, in the private Home Park near Windsor Castle, where Queen Elizabeth II lives most of the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family also have a country estate in Norfolk in eastern England and a holiday cottage in Scotland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                George and Charlotte previously went to a school in west London, Thomas’s Battersea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move announcement comes as William’s brother Prince Harry and his wife Meghan plan to stay in Frogmore Cottage, a short distance from Adelaide Cottage at Windsor, while visiting the UK to attend charity events in September

                — Photo by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash Ecommerce giant Amazon is now offering free delivery to Malaysia on their Singaporean website for orders on select items that total up to more than S$40 (RM128.69)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Amazon has not specified when the promotion will be ending, the terms and conditions page for the offer does include a mention that if items are not purchased while the campaign is in effect, the free shipping will not be applied
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysians keen on taking advantage of the free shipping deal will need to check if all the products in their cart qualify for the promotion, as according to Amazon, shipping will still be charged on any ineligible products during check out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Users should keep an eye out for a message saying “Free international delivery if you spend over MYR128.69 on eligible items” (for orders with multiple items) or “FREE international delivery” (for orders consisting of a single item that is already priced above the minimum order value) on product listings that are part of the promotion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once the qualifying items are added to the cart and minimum value has been reached, the option for free shipping will be automatically selected during checkout

                — Photo by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash Ecommerce giant Amazon is now offering free delivery to Malaysia on their Singaporean website for orders on select items that total up to more than S$40 (RM128.69)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Amazon has not specified when the promotion will be ending, the terms and conditions page for the offer does include a mention that if items are not purchased while the campaign is in effect, the free shipping will not be applied
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysians keen on taking advantage of the free shipping deal will need to check if all the products in their cart qualify for the promotion, as according to Amazon, shipping will still be charged on any ineligible products during check out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Users should keep an eye out for a message saying “Free international delivery if you spend over MYR128.69 on eligible items” (for orders with multiple items) or “FREE international delivery” (for orders consisting of a single item that is already priced above the minimum order value) on product listings that are part of the promotion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once the qualifying items are added to the cart and minimum value has been reached, the option for free shipping will be automatically selected during checkout

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Aug 21 — The investigation paper on the trial judge who heard Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s case over the misappropriation of RM42 million of government-owned firm SRC International Sdn Bhd is not with the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC), Tan Sri Idrus Harun said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last week, in a statement posted on Twitter, Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan claimed that a document alleged to be the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) investigation papers on judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali had been leaked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Maslan noted the Federal Court’s unanimous decision to reject Najib’s bid to admit new evidence on Mohd Nazlan’s purported conflict of interest as part of his final appeal over his conviction in the SRC International case, and that the MACC investigation paper on the judge was sent to the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) on May 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then said Umno is of the view that “MACC has to confirm or deny the validity of the investigation papers that have gone viral”, and that the “Attorney General’s Chambers has to announce if there will be further action for those investigation papers”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 23, news portal Malaysiakini reported Idrus as saying that the AGC is still examining the investigation papers by the MACC on Mohd Nazlan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are perusing the investigation paper before we make our decision,” he was quoted as saying via a text message.

            <p>
                The Court of Appeal, in reversing a High Court ruling recently, ruled that children born to Malaysian women married to foreign spouses were not entitled to by operation of law be Malaysian citizens

            <p>
                The High Court, in its decision to allow children born overseas to Malaysian mothers married to foreigners to automatically be entitled to citizenship by operation of law, had held that the word “father” in Section 1(b) must be read to include mother

                Idrus also pointed out that a child born in Malaysia is a citizen by operation of law as long as a parent is a Malaysian citizen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Court of Appeal, in reversing a High Court ruling recently, ruled that children born to Malaysian women married to foreign spouses were not entitled to by operation of law be Malaysian citizens
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court, in its decision to allow children born overseas to Malaysian mothers married to foreigners to automatically be entitled to citizenship by operation of law, had held that the word “father” in Section 1(b) must be read to include mother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said in Singapore, one can have dual citizenship until the person reaches 21 years of age, adding that Malaysia does not recognise dual citizenship
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If this is the case, one will have to renounce the other citizenship,” he said

            <p>
                Brunei’s policy on citizenship is the same as Malaysia while for Indonesia, both parents must be citizens for a child born outside the country

                Nazri then questioned if Vigneswaran would apply the “political prostitute” label to the prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that support for MIC and BN from the Indian community would depend on a sound explanation from Vigneswaran on the Malaysian Indian Community Transformation Unit (Mitra) fund
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Mitra is the government’s effort to help the Indian people, but until today, the issue has not been answered by MIC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Describing the MIC president’s victory in the Johor state elections as living in an imaginary world, Nazri said that the victory was due to Malay support for Umno and not MIC’s own merits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If it really is great, MIC should ask for seats with a majority of Indian voters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If they win, then we can say that the Indian community has come back to support MIC,” he said

                Penang deputy police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Fisol Salleh (second leftt) with other police personnel looking at two motorcycles that have been confiscated at the Southwest District Police Headquarters in Balik Pulau, Penang.

                This could happen once the police applies to impose these penalties against negligent parents under Section 33 of the Child Act 2001 in order to hold parents accountable when their underaged children end up as illegal racers, said Penang deputy police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Fisol Salleh

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Aug 21 — With the Covid-19 pandemic situation stabilising in Singapore, the Government will further relax rules on wearing of face masks in public, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To curb the spread of the coronavirus, people here used to have to put on face masks when they leave their homes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This rule was relaxed from March 29, with the wearing of face masks mandated only in indoor settings, though people were still encouraged to wear them when they leave home, especially in crowded areas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that beyond the infection controls, Singapore must learn the lessons from the pandemic, and be ready for a possible future where “a new virus will emerge, more transmissible, more adaptable and more dangerous than Covid-19”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The most important lesson is to maintain the spirit of personal and social responsibility,” Lee said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Continue to nurture the trust in our society — day in, day out — during normal times, so that during the next crisis, we can again draw upon a deep reservoir of trust to see us through, just like we have done during Covid-19.” In his speech, Lee also announced a new special state award called the Covid-19 Resilience Medal that will be presented to people who played a direct part in the fight against the pandemic.

                “If this continues and the government intends to break the spirit of the youth, the future of the younger generation is in jeopardy and the fate of Malaysia is very dark,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Thursday, Amanah’s Hasbie Muda, Batu PKR youth chief Sabda Suluh Lestari Yahya and student activist Aliff Naif Mohd Fizam, were charged with failing to notify the police five days before staging their gatherings in protest of recent issues

            <p>
                “If the freedom of expression by the youth continues to be suppressed and they continue to be dragged to court, there will be no future for them,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasbie’s charge was related to an event he had allegedly organised at Masjid Jamek, Kampung Baru on July 1, while Sabda’s charge concerned a protest in front of the Sogo shopping complex on July 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aliff’s charge also involved a protest against the rise in the price of goods, held in front of Sogo on July 23

            <p>
                Pakatan Harapan (PH) Youth later slammed the authorities for charging the three, claiming it was “politically motivated” and intended to “intimidate the youth”

                “If this continues and the government intends to break the spirit of the youth, the future of the younger generation is in jeopardy and the fate of Malaysia is very dark,” he said in a statement
            </p>

                On Thursday, Amanah’s Hasbie Muda, Batu PKR youth chief Sabda Suluh Lestari Yahya and student activist Aliff Naif Mohd Fizam, were charged with failing to notify the police five days before staging their gatherings in protest of recent issues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If the freedom of expression by the youth continues to be suppressed and they continue to be dragged to court, there will be no future for them,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasbie’s charge was related to an event he had allegedly organised at Masjid Jamek, Kampung Baru on July 1, while Sabda’s charge concerned a protest in front of the Sogo shopping complex on July 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aliff’s charge also involved a protest against the rise in the price of goods, held in front of Sogo on July 23
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pakatan Harapan (PH) Youth later slammed the authorities for charging the three, claiming it was “politically motivated” and intended to “intimidate the youth”

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 20 — Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob was an unexpected choice to succeed Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, but political observers believe his appointment as Malaysia’s ninth prime minister last year is keeping the nation moving forward through economic and political crises both at home and globally

            <p>
                Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia political analyst Kartini Aboo Talib commended Ismail Sabri for enlarging his “Keluarga Malaysia” concept to “Keluarga Global” as instrumental for political stability within Asean during the Covid-19 era

            <p>
                Incidental nation-builder Universiti Sains Malaysia’s political scientist Ahmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid said that Ismail Sabri’s ability to weather the storm shaking Malaysia’s political stability might have helped the 62-year-old increase his support among Malaysians

                Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, an associate director with Vriens & Partners — a public policy, government affairs and political risk consultancy — said Ismail Sabri’s biggest contribution in his first year as PM was showing he has political will to push through institutional and health reforms

                Ravinthran, and Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, also affirmed the decision of the High Court that disallowed Aminah Abdullah’s application for a declaration that six million shares in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd were also part of her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision in an online proceeding yesterday, dismissed the appeal brought by Jamaluddin’s children – Ikhwan Hafiz and Nur Anis – and the cross-appeal by Aminah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah was appealing against the High Court’s dismissal of her application to include the Alpine Motion and Ivory Insights shares as part of her son’s estate, while her grandchildren were appealing against the High Court’s ruling to put the Rantai Wawasan shares in the list of their father’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan said the Rantai Wawasan shares should be included in Jamaluddin’s estate as the trust deed which was created in 2009 when Jamaluddin was alive was valid and that the trust deed created in 2015 by Jamaluddin’s children after his (Jamaluddin’s) demise was null and void
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah is seeking to include the three million Rantai Wawasan shares worth RM1.44bil, six million Alpine Motion shares worth RM233mil and two Ivory Insights shares worth RM80mil in her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her statement of claim, Aminah claimed that her grandchildren failed to enter the shares of the three companies – Rantai Wawasan, Alpine Motion and Ivory Insight – as part of the deceased’s estate with the intention of denying her rights and interests as a beneficiary

                “Can Zahid explain his silence on his primary role in the RM9 billion LCS scandal, which had exposed his earlier constant denials that he was to be blamed for the RM9 billion LCS scandal as lies?” he asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The JKSTUPKK report disclosed that Zahid, as defence minister in 2011, had sided with the contractor, Boustead Naval Shipyard (BNS) instead of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN), the end-user for the six LCS ordered by the government
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim also asked the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission to explain why it has yet to charge anyone directly for the RM9 billion LCS scandal

                He also took to task Defence Minister Datuk Hishamuddin Hussein for still keeping quiet about his ministry’s decision to halve the number of LCS that must be completed and delivered to the RMN by the contractor with no additional government funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When Hishammuddin appeared before the Public Accounts Committee on 25th January 2022, he spoke about ‘corporate restructuring’ of the RM9 billion LCS contract and that the contractor, BNS, will have to deliver two LCS without any new cost to the government
