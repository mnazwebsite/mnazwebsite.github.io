                Previously, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the relaxation, which is aimed at simplifying the entry procedure for travellers to Malaysia, was decided due to the current state of the health system, which is at a good and controlled level
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Elaborating further, Dr Noor Hisham said on arrival, if the traveller is detected to have a fever through the thermal scanner or found to be unwell, they will be referred for re-examination by the health department
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "After a health assessment is made and if there is a case of suspected illness due to infectious diseases such as Covid-19, monkeypox, MERS-CoV or others, the traveller will be referred to a nearby health facility for further check-up and treatment
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "All newly arrived travellers from abroad are advised to practise self-health status monitoring, comply with the set standard operating procedures (SOP) and go to a nearby health facility for examination if unwell," he said

                Ramkarpal Singh said the autopsy report would help determine how Kim Shih Keat died on June 28

                “If we cannot establish the cause of death, then an inquest should be held,” Ramkarpal, who is also the Bukit Gelugor MP, said at a press conference

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ramkarpal said he had written to the coroner in Johor two days ago for an update on whether an inquest would be held

                According to Zarul, his admission to lying to the press is due to the MACC's investigation into the project

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia is scrambling to protect its assets as the descendants of the last sultan of the remote Philippine region of Sulu look to enforce a U$15 billion (RM67 billion) arbitration award in a dispute over a colonial-era land deal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 1878, two European colonists signed a deal with the sultan for the use of his territory in present-day Malaysia – an agreement that independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the monarch's descendants about $1,000 (about RM5,000) a year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia disputes that, saying the sultanate ceded sovereignty and the arbitration was illegitimate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "The arbitration is a sophisticated fiction, veiled as a legal process," Uria Menendez, a Spanish law firm representing Malaysia, told Reuters
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The heirs rejected Thomas' offer and the arbitration went on without Malaysia's participation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Stampa argued in his award statement that the courts did not have jurisdiction over arbitration, and moved the case to France to deliver the award - actions that Malaysia says were unlawful

                Tourists look on as a Chinese military helicopter flies past Pingtan island, one of mainland China's closest point from Taiwan, ahead of massive military drills off Taiwan following Pelosi's visit

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It sparked a furious reaction from Beijing, which vowed "punishment" and announced military drills in the seas around Taiwan - some of the world's busiest waterways

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Beijing's nationalist state-run tabloid Global Times said, citing military analysts, that the exercises were "unprecedented" and that missiles would fly over Taiwan for the first time

                In a written parliamentary reply, Hamzah also said 1,461 people had applied to withdraw from the programme from September 2021 until June this year

                Responding to Lukanisman Awang Sauni (GPS-Sibuti) in the Dewan Rakyat, its minister, Annuar Musa, said Samsung was chosen as the provider after winning the contract through an open tender that was wrapped up last month

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This comes after a two-month-long delay in the distribution of the devices after the finance ministry asked for the contract to be re-tendered in May

                The delay was criticised by several parties, notably former deputy education minister Teo Nie Ching, as applicants were left in the dark about the status of their applications that were made in May

                Kepong MP Lim Lip Eng praised MIC for pushing for answers over the matter, despite how it allegedly involved a member of Bersatu, a party MIC is working with in the government

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I stand with MIC to urge Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) to explain the (politician’s) appointment and terminate it altogether,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I also want to question how the individual managed to go through the relevant checks to be a member of the DBKL board
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                I hope DBKL can reveal if there are any other appointees or staff who are insolvent yet still serving in DBKL.” Lim still managed to take a swipe at MIC, asking why the Barisan Nasional component party did not similarly raise its voice over the 1MDB scandal involving former prime minister Najib Razak

                He said the “personal liberty” stated in Article 5(1) was not an absolute right, but a right that could be regulated, such as the right to own drugs or firearms

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The article protects individuals from executive arbitrariness, but Shad said personal liberty could be deprived if this was done according to law

                As for subjecting the generation born in 2007 and later to the Tobacco and Smoking Control Bill, Shad said this was “rational and reasonable” according to the law

                As age is not a protected category, Bar Council official Andrew Khoo said it could be argued that concerns about discrimination under the bill were unwarranted

                James Chin of the University of Tasmania and the Umno Supreme Council member, who declined to be named, said these rumours should not be taken too seriously as the focus at the federal level is on the next general election (GE15)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Chin believed that Rauf was dissatisfied because he had expected to become the chief minister after the landslide win in the Melaka state elections last year

                “These rumours are just part of an ongoing feud among some unhappy members of Umno,” he told FMT

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Small issues at the state level are just a sideshow,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last week, Rauf denied allegations that the 21 Umno assemblymen had any issue with Sulaiman’s leadership

                Does MCA have a money tree in their garden producing money? Or as Bersatu Youth chief Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal once said, you can print more money

                We all know that the current Selangor government is serving its people extremely well
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hence BN's focus on Selangor

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                MCA is part of the federal government and if it is sincere about affordable housing and other issues, it should make its proposal there and ensure that these are implemented nationwide, not just in Selangor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                The lawmaker also added that Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor, who is the chairman of the ruling Gabungan Rakyat Sabah there, previously made a promise to look into the matter, but has not given the public any updates on the investigation

                In January, activist groups in Sabah questioned the identity of Sabah MIC chief Peer Mohamad Kadir, who allegedly shares the same name as an individual from India who entered the state in 1984, and was a witness in the Royal Commission of Inquiry (RCI) on illegal immigration in Sabah in 2013

                The individual, who was the 116th witness in the RCI, confessed to obtaining a Malaysian identity card through dubious means allegedly with the help of an uncle, after coming to Sabah in 1984 from Chennai, India

                Asbi Munip, 32, said this was because the money laundering case investigation was focused on the transfer of RM100,000 from Syed Saddiq’s personal Maybank account to his Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) account

                However, the report said the programme, aimed at improving the quality of life for B40 households living in the city, had reached the targeted number of participants

                That same agency, it said, failed to carry out repair works approved for 113 participants, while some RM1.08 million was returned to the finance ministry in 2016 following the housing and local government ministry’s failure to implement the programme

                Future-proof health financing options will be included in the Health White Paper that is to be presented by year end, says Khairy Jamaluddin

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 – Malaysia’s public health care system, which charges RM1 and RM5 for outpatient and specialist care respectively in Ministry of Health (MOH) facilities, is unsustainable, Khairy Jamaluddin said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The government is aware that the existing public health financing model is not sustainable and will put additional pressure on the federal expenditure
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As such, the government is currently studying various future-proof health financing options to strengthen the country’s health care system as a whole so that health services are more equitable, have high standards, easily accessible at a reasonable cost, and are sustainable in the long run
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairy said the government will use a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to ensure that the people’s health interests are protected in the implementation of any health financing system in the future

                Dr Mahathir added that if there was no evidence to support the claim, he considered Apandi's statement libellous and that he had the right to take legal action
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former prime minister was responding to four questions posed by Apandi on Facebook last month, including on the Batu Puteh case, the Sulu claim, and his dismissal suit as AG
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Apandi's actions also showed negligence in claiming that Najib was innocent

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the question of why he unilaterally withdrew Malaysia’s bid to overturn the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) 2008 ruling on Batu Puteh, Dr Mahathir said it was in respect of an earlier agreement with Singapore
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "If Malaysia had not dropped the claim, Indonesia would also have grounds to claim both the Sipadan and Ligitan islands off Sabah," he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "New facts on Batu Puteh, if present, should also be presented to the international courts when making a representation that Batu Puteh indeed belonged to Malaysia," he said.

                DAP central executive committee member Sheikh Umar Bagharib Ali said clarity was needed in the issue following several replies in Parliament regarding Oktoberfest

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the issue stemmed from a parliamentary reply from Deputy National Unity Minister Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal who defended Religious Affairs Minister Datuk Idris Ahmad’s personal view that both Bon Odori and Oktoberfest should not be allowed
