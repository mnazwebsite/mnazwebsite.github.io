                Using the Forensic Facial Approximation method, the researchers managed to put a face on the prehistoric human skeleton, dubbed the "Penang Woman”

                The skeleton was first found during the construction of a gallery for the Guar Kepah neolithic site in Kepala Batas in 2017

                Maara said it has signed a three-year memorandum of understanding (MoU) in the fields of research, expertise, experience sharing and technological development with UTM for the purpose of drafting a practical ELV blueprint that can be implemented in Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The association also called for a clearly defined roadmap and policy to help it in drafting the blueprint, which will provide solutions for vehicle owners and ensure a return on their investment

                “For smart and long-term investment to happen, a clear road map is required,” it said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The road map will consist of effective monitoring of the recycling sector by taking into consideration actual industry practices to create a ‘win-win situation’ for the vehicle owners, recyclers and the government.” The MoU was signed between Maara president Khan Akram Khan and UTM vice-chancellor Ahmad Fauzi Ismail in the presence of science, technology and innovation minister Dr Adham Baba at UTM’s Kuala Lumpur campus

                The PAC team visited its warehouse and storehouses which stored LCS-related and general equipment, from ammunition to ship parts and even smart televisions

                Wong said he could not help but question how BNS, which was given the RM9 billion LCS project contract through direct negotiations, ended up in its current position

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                (It was) totally stalled,” he had said after the visit, adding that it was “heartbreaking”, given that RM6 billion was already spent by Putrajaya for the LCS

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The absorbing horror story in the whole process of the LCS project shall serve as a lesson to all those who are in power, now and in the future.” Last week, the PAC said not a single LCS ship had been completed although Putrajaya had already paid RM6 billion for the RM9 billion project

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The PAC report said BNS’ financial position was in a weak and critical state, due to abuse of power and deficiencies in its financial management

                Najib’s lawyer, Firoz Hussein Ahmad Jamaluddin, told the High Court here that Alan Gomez and Lai Wei Shiung came from the same firm as Thomas

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Thomas and the government are seeking to nullify the lawsuit on grounds that the case was frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of court process

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                In October 2014, UKSB's first cash payment ― totalling S$200,000 ― was given to Ahmad Zahid at his private residence in Country Heights, Kajang Selangor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                An increase of S$100,000 per month roughly two years later With UKSB agreeing to Ahmad Zahid's request for the increment, the first S$300,000 cash payment was made in April 2015
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As there were no payments made in March 2015, a sum of S$600,000 was paid to Ahmad Zahid in April instead to make up for the previous month
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Final increment of cash payment up to S$5520,000 In July 2017, the agreed amount of S$300,000 was once again asked by Ahmad Zahid to be further increased due to the upcoming general election in 2018
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Cash payments of S$520,000 were paid to Ahmad Zahid on a monthly basis from July 2017 onwards up until March 2018 where the final payment was delivered
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But wait, where was the money given to Ahmad Zahid? As we have established, Ahmad Zahid met with UKSB representatives at his private residence in Country Heights, Kajang Selangor

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 12 — Parti Bangsa Malaysia (PBM) is urging the federal government to enact new legislation criminalising cyberbullying
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As a point of reference, Muniraa cited an example of Singapore's Protection from Harassment Act
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Enacted in 2014, the law was designed specifically to make cyberbullying, stalking and online harassment within and out of the workplace a criminal offence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Stressing the need to stamp out the menace, Muniraa also cited a Unicef report which had ranked Malaysia second in Asia for cyberbullying among youths in 2020
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She also said victims should also have easy access to counsellors while being taught online etiquette and how to respond when harassed by online bullies
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Citing the Public Accounts Committee’s (PAC) report on the project, Bukit Mertajam MP Steven Sim said then defence minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had decided on the SETIS system instead of the navy’s choice of the Tacticos system
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The SETIS system chosen by the minister is not only more expensive, it has yet to be fully developed, and is also at risk of becoming obsolete in five to 10 years
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sim said switching from the initial Sigma-class ships chosen by the navy to the Gowind design of Naval Group of France in 2011 could have set Malaysia’s naval ship manufacturing industry back by years
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Malaysia missed out on the chance for technology transfer, pointing to how the Sigma-class was designed by the Dutch company Damen Shipyard, which was supposed to make Malaysia its manufacturing hub
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said this would have allowed for important technology transfer for the local combat ship manufacturing industry while creating high-value jobs for Malaysians

                Citing the cybersecurity breach experienced by online payment provider iPay88, PKR information chief Fahmi Fadzil said the security of Malaysians’ personal data was a national security issue

                Yesterday, iPay88 confirmed it experienced a cybersecurity breach which may have compromised the card data of users more than two months ago

                Justice Department asked a judge on Thursday to make public the warrant that authorized the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, after Trump, a Republican, portrayed it as political retribution

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a Facebook post, Sydney Yap said that “instead of taking positive action” to review the working conditions of journalists after she raised concerns about various bureaucratic practices in Bernama, the agency’s CEO Roslan Ariffin had instead “made false allegations to me (sic)”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “… (this) is extremely unprofessional and I will post a full statement to respond as soon as possible.” However, the newsreader did not elaborate on the false accusations allegedly made by Roslan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yap, who is set to leave the news agency, previously said she wanted to speak out during her final days at Bernama in order to raise awareness of problems faced by the media
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was previously reported that Bernama wanted to sue the newsreader for alleged defamation over claims that the Mandarin broadcast news unit was seeing pay cuts and less airtime
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yap wrote a lengthy Facebook post last week after Bernama announced that its 6pm Mandarin news programme would only air from Monday to Friday
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, speaking to Malaysiakini yesterday, Roslan said that the message circulated to the media that Yap would face legal action was actually an internal report and recommendation from Bernama’s human resources department

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Aug 11 — Only children born overseas to Malaysian fathers who are married to foreign spouses are entitled to get citizenship by operation of law, the Court of Appeal held
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This means it precluded Malaysian mothers who are married to a non-Malaysian citizen from passing on their citizenship status to their children who were born outside Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the remedy for Malaysian mothers who are married to foreign spouses to get Malaysian citizenship for their children who were born overseas is provided under Article 15 (2) of the Federal Constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said Article 14 (1) (b) of the Federal Constitution and section 1 (b) of Part II of the Federal Constitution were not gendered discriminatory against women
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the word “father’ in Section 1 (b) Part II of the Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution should be read in a non-discriminatory way to include “mother’ as by virtue of Article 8 (2) of the Federal Constitution it will be unconstitutional to practice gender discrimination by recognising the blood descent of the father but not that of the mother for purposes of according citizenship to children born overseas
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Friday, the Court of Appeal panel had also made it clear that the status quo should be maintained for overseas-born children of the six Malaysian mothers who had obtained citizenship, pending disposal of their appeal to the Federal Court

                It is nothing new,” he said at a press conference after the launch of TalentCorp’s mynext initiative

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He pointed out that some people were inclined to work dangerous, dirty and difficult jobs in another country as opposed to their own due to the lucrative income
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saravanan said several factors like minimum wage and the economy needed to be considered to adequately solve the brain drain issue in the country
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Saravanan said the struggle his ministry was facing was unemployability due to skills mismatch which could be traced back to the outdated education system
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On a different note, Saravanan said it was “typical” of DAP’s Kula Segaran to call him out last week for allegedly failing to provide an adequate answer on the money spent by the Human Resources Development Corporation (HRD Corp) for overseas trips

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Court of Appeal judge Justice Kamaludin Md Said in his written grounds of judgment of last Friday's appellate court's 2-1 majority decision in disallowing citizenship to children born overseas to Malaysian mothers and foreign fathers, said the word "father" in Section 1(b) of Part II of the Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution refers to father only and is not intended to include the mother
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This means it precluded Malaysian mothers who are married to a non-Malaysian citizen from passing on their citizenship status to their children who were born outside Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the remedy for Malaysian mothers who are married to foreign spouses to get Malaysian citizenship for their children who were born overseas is provided under Article 15(2) of the Federal Constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said Article 14(1)(b) of the Federal Constitution and Section 1(b) of Part II of the Federal Constitution were not gendered discriminatory against women
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the word "father' in Section 1(b) Part II of the Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution should be read in a non-discriminatory way to include "mother' as by virtue of Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution, and it will be unconstitutional to practise gender discrimination by recognising the blood descent of the father, but not that of the mother for purposes of according citizenship to children born overseas

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Friday, the Court of Appeal panel had also made it clear that the status quo should be maintained for overseas-born children of the six Malaysian mothers who had obtained citizenship, pending disposal of their appeal to the Federal Court

                On a separate issue, Khairy said the uptake for Covid-19 second dose booster shots was still quite low

                He said the low uptake had been expected but the health ministry would continue to recommend and encourage those aged 50 years and older, especially those with health risks, to get their booster shots

                Uma Devi, 43, who appeared as the prosecution’s 12th witness said the cheque was issued by Najib himself to Shahrir on November 27, 2013 and that the cheque was cleared the next day
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The act is a violation of Section 113(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1967, over the RM1 million, believed to be from unlawful activities, which he received from Najib through a cheque
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Based on Datuk Seri Najib’s bank statement, the balance as of November 2013 was RM48,273,239.26 and the balance as of November 30, 2013 was RM36,922,068.26
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On November 28, 2013 there was a withdrawal of RM1 million from the account,” she said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Uma Devi said Najib’s bank account which was opened on July 31, 2013 was closed on March 9, 2015 with no reason stated for the closure

                As the Chief Justice, Tengku Maimun will decide on the composition of the bench hearing Najib's appeal at the Federal Court — the former prime minister's last shot at staying out of jail

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lawyers and court observers said it would be interesting to see whether both Rohana and Azahar would be empanelled to hear Najib's pivotal appeal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Should Rohana or Azahar not sit in on Monday, the Chief Justice or Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim would likely lead the bench in hearing the appeal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This would likely mean another Federal Court bench would have to be made up to hear the review

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The bench members could be chosen from the present nine Federal Court members that did not hear the case, and if needed, other senior Court of Appeal judges could be asked to make up the bench

                In a statement, health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the ministry was notified of the product recall throughout the European market last month

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The vanilla ice cream was produced using vanilla extracts imported from Madagascar that contained ETO above the permissible amount for consumption

                The former Pandan MP alleged that Lodin ceded control of the project to CAD during a BHIC board meeting on April 28, 2010, more than a year before the government appointed BHIC subsidiary Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) as the LCS contractor via direct negotiations

                “I don’t have the minutes of the meeting with me.” On Monday, Rafizi said that he was in possession of “leaked” information regarding the LCS project

                In the Public Accounts Committee’s (PAC) report on the LCS project which was released last Thursday, LCS’ forensic auditor implied that Lodin agreed to this decision which gave RAD “absolute power” in CAD

                Rafizi explained that LTAT, a subsidiary of Boustead Heavy Industries Corporation (BHIC), approved the purchase of a 51 per cent stake in CAD, with the other 49 per cent going to Rheinmetall Air Defense AG (RAD), a German defence contractor company held through subsidiaries wholly owned company RD Investment AG

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that the purchase agreement between CAD and BHIC agreed that RAD has management control over CAD despite the fact that it is owned in majority by BHIC

            <p> </p>

                “As a result of that ridiculous decision, CAD is only owned by Boustead and LTAT on paper

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The CEO and CFO, the two most important management positions in CAD, were agreed to be appointed by RAD instead of Boustead and LTAT,” he said, adding that the current CEO of CAD is one Gordon Hargreave who represents RAD

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said that the decision to give management control to the smaller shareholder was approved by chairman of the BHIC board of directors Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, who is the former CEO of LTAT

                Tanjong Malim MP Chang Lih Kang said the Dewan Rakyat had been informed that the average daily ridership for MRT3 was expected to be 180,300 passengers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said transport minister Wee Ka Siong had also informed the Dewan Rakyat that there were expected to be 1.01 million daily passengers by 2060
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Chang, however, pointed out that as per MRT Corp’s own website, MRT3’s projection was low given that it had more stations than MRT1 and was only 5km shorter than MRT2
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The average daily ridership projections for the lines are 442,000 and 529,000, respectively,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Given that the length of MRT3 is approximately 51km with 33 stations, what causes the ridership projection to plummet so drastically to 180,300?” Chang said the figure was not even 40% of MRT1’s projection and 35% of MRT2’s projection
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Chang also pointed out that since it began full operations in 2017, the highest average daily ridership that MRT1 achieved was 204,821 passengers in 2019

                The context as well as the gaffes of the interview evidently displayed that Pelosi was very tense and troubled

                During the interview, Pelosi said that "it was only about saying, China is one of the freest societies in the world, don't take it from me, that's from Freedom House, it's a strong democracy, courageous people." Soon after Pelosi's tongue slip, Drew Hammill, her deputy chief of staff tweeted that what Pelosi referred here is the island of Taiwan

                American hostile against China stirred up by China hawks, represented by Pelosi, has entered a state of irrationality and hysteria

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, Aug 11 — The prosecution today rested its case after calling in a total of 18 witnesses and presenting more than a hundred documents in court in former home minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi’s case — where he is charged with receiving bribes from Ultra Kirana Sdn Bhd (UKSB)

                Following the close of the prosecution’s case today, the High Court has fixed September 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 for oral submissions for both sides to present their final arguments before High Court judge Datuk Mohd Yazid Mustafa decides on whether the prosecution had made out its prima facie case

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, Aug 11 ― A Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigator today disagreed with the defence team in Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi's foreign visa system (VLN) contract corruption trial that the prosecution against the former home minister was politically motivated and selectively conducted
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mahendran, who is also the 18th prosecution witness and investigating officer assigned to the case, made the assertion under cross-examination by defence lawyer Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Zainal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ahmad Zaidi then further cross-examined the witness on whether those named in a ledger UKSB owned for bookkeeping purposes on cash payments made by UKSB to various politicians, government staff and Ahmad Zahid himself have been called for questioning
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The witness also disagreed with the defence suggestion that there was no other documentary evidence supporting the charges filed against Ahmad Zahid except those of the ledger and witness testimonies of those from UKSB
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mahendran replied in the negative

                Ahmad Zahid was charged with another seven counts as home minister who obtained S$1.15 million, RM3 million, S₣15,000 and US$15,000 in cash from the same company for himself in connection with his official work

                “However, upon arriving, costs for travel and passports were deducted every month from their salaries and they were forced to work long hours to pay off this ‘debt’,” South Klang district police chief Cha Hoong Fong said

                Ayadali noted that there was no specific law in Malaysia to deal with cyberbullying despite a lot of talk about it for many years

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said it remained a huge challenge to eradicate cyberbullying, considering the many forms of online social interactions

                The virus, named Langya henipavirus or LayV, was found thanks to an early detection system for feverish people with a recent history of exposure to animals in eastern China

                There was no evidence they had been in close contact or had a common exposure history, suggesting human infection may be sporadic, the researchers said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong Chin Huat of Sunway University said Azalina’s proposal for a recall election mechanism would be the best way of plugging loopholes such as one that leaves a party at a disadvantage if it were to sack a member who is an MP
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under the bill passed by the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara, MPs sacked by their parties would retain their seats, which means a party would lose out for taking action against an MP
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under Azalina’s proposal, a by-election could be triggered if 40% of the voters in a constituency signed a recall petition, if an MP were to be sacked by his or her party or if a party were to quit a coalition
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The power to punish party-hoppers would then be with the voters,” Wong told FMT
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This is something DAP plans to do by amending its constitution so that elected representatives who do not toe the party line on fundamental issues will automatically lose their membership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But he said the danger of this “roundabout remedy” is that the party constitution might become so constraining that MPs might lose their autonomy and become yes men

                Ahmad Kamarulzaman was responding to allegations on social media that the launch of KD Maharajalela (referred to as LCS 1) was just for show and that the actual ship was not at the event

                Ahmad Kamarulzaman said the tradition was also practised in other parts of the world, adding that the same was done for the LCS built by France’s Naval Group for the United Arab Emirates

                North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks at a politburo meeting of the Worker's Party on the country's coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak response in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on May 21, 2022

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While lifting the maximum anti-pandemic measures, Kim said that North Korea must maintain a "steel-strong anti-epidemic barrier and intensifying the anti-epidemic work until the end of the global health crisis," according to a report by state news agency KCNA

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Instead of confirmed cases, North Korea reported the number of people with fever symptoms
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                He ordered the lifting of maximum anti-pandemic measures, but said that North Korea must maintain a "steel-strong anti-epidemic barrier and intensifying the anti-epidemic work until the end of the global health crisis." Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, said the North Korean leader himself had suffered from fever symptoms, and blamed leaflets from South Korea for causing the outbreak, KCNA reported

                “What is the point of having a large skeleton or hull without wiring, weapons and equipment? Unfortunately, the detailed LCS design that should have been completed in November 2016 remains approximately at 80 per cent now in 2022
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Nazim’s insistence that the equipment for the LCS had to be bought in bulk for cost savings, Lim said this was debunked by former auditor-general Tan Sri Ambrin Buang who told the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in December 2020 that the LCS contract was signed without finalised designs
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Liew then denounced Nazim as unfit to be the chief executive of the LTAT given the latter’s professed belief that it was acceptable for the main contractor of the LCS to use the project’s payments for a separate but similarly troubled New Generational Patrol Vessel (NGPV) project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “How can he agree that the use of the LCS funds embezzled for the ‘bailout’ of the NGPV project is reasonable and acceptable? “One day, the LTAT fund can also be embezzled for the ‘bailout’ of other projects
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a Facebook post yesterday, Nazim sought to explain why none of the six LCS purchased by the government has been completed yet

                In a Facebook post, Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi said the state government has presented its findings regarding the coordination of weekend rest days for His Majesty the Sultan of Johor’s consideration

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was first reported on June 14 that the Johor government is reviewing the current Friday and Saturday weekend rest days in the state following complaints by the public
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Following that, Malay Mail reported on June 20 that the state government may implement an official two-and-a-half-day weekend, with Friday as a half-day, followed by Saturday and Sunday as weekend rest days
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Emilia’s counsel Nizam Bashir Abdul Kariem Bashir argued that Article 126 of the Federal Constitution indicated that the power to initiate committal proceedings lies within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, Court of Appeal and the High Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nizam said the Kuala Lumpur shariah court could not hear the committal proceedings against his client because she is no longer a resident of the Federal Territory and now lives in Kajang, Selangor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also rejected Emilia’s application to suspend the ongoing committal proceedings in the shariah high court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Other respondents are the Registrar of the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court, the Chief Registrar of the Federal Territories shariah court of appeal, the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court, the Kuala Lumpur shariah court of appeal and the government of Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Based on the judicial review application, Emilia said she did not live or reside in the Federal Territory during the “hadhanah” (custody) proceedings filed at the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court on July 23, 2018
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Emilia sought a declaration that the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court and shariah court of appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear and punish any individual who contravenes the court, as it is the exclusive rights of the civil courts, according to Article 126 of the Federal Constitution

                Judicial Commissioner Roz Mawar Rozain, in her decision, said it was unfair to have the charge looming over Hasanah’s head

                Just over three in five sexually-active Malaysian youths say they had their first sexual experience at the age of 22 or younger

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                — 123rf.com The number of Malaysian youths involved in sexual intercourse has doubled since 2016, according to a recent survey
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to the Sexual Health and Intimate Wellness Survey 2022, which spoke to over 1,000 Malaysians aged between 18 and 30, 35.4% of them had had sexual intercourse, compared to 18.8% from the first survey in 2016

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                And among this group, 62% had their first sexual experience at the age of 22 or younger
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                More worrying is that the survey found that 42% of youths prefer to engage in sex without condoms

                Third Warrant Officer Jeffrey Heng suffered some injuries when he landed during the National Day Parade

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                3WO Heng, the last of 10 parachutists to land, was stretchered off after his rough landing on Tuesday that saw him tumble to the ground
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                We wish a speedy recovery to 3WO Jeffrey!" 3WO Heng had attempted to land at a safe distance away from his teammates, while fighting against strong crosswinds, said retired commando Chan Seck Sung, who was in the audience at the Marina Bay floating platform and witnessed 3WO Heng’s hard landing
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                You should just land where the wind takes you,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “It is also best to land on grass because it is softer.” Chan added that parachutists are trained to break their fall by rolling on the ground

                Taiwan rejects China’s sovereignty claims, says the island’s people should decide its future and vows to defend its democracy

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China had said in two previous white papers on Taiwan, in 1993 and 2000, that it “will not send troops or administrative personnel to be based in Taiwan” after achieving unification
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                That line, meant to assure Taiwan it would enjoy autonomy after becoming a special administrative region of China, did not appear in the latest white paper
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s ruling Communist Party had proposed that Taiwan could return to its rule under a “one country, two systems” model, similar to the formula under which the former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A line in the 2000 white paper that said “anything can be negotiated” as long as Taiwan accepts that there is only one China and does not seek independence, is also missing from the latest white paper
