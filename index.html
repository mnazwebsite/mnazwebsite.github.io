                As such, Attorney-General Idrus Harun said he could not confirm the authenticity of a leaked document purportedly of MACC’s probe papers into Nazlan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The documents appeared to suggest that MACC had concluded its investigation into Nazlan and submitted its report to the AGC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This prompted Umno secretary-general Ahmad Maslan to urge MACC to confirm the documents’ authenticity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad pointed out that on May 21, MACC said it had concluded its probe into the appellate judge and submitted its investigation papers to the AGC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nazlan, who was promoted to the Court of Appeal in February, was the judge who presided over Najib’s SRC trial in the High Court and sentenced the former prime minister to 12 years’ jail and a RM210 million fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday, the Federal Court dismissed Najib’s application to adduce fresh evidence to prove that Nazlan was under a serious conflict of interest when presiding over the SRC trial two years ago

                As such, Attorney-General Idrus Harun said he could not confirm the authenticity of a leaked document purportedly of MACC’s probe papers into Nazlan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The documents appeared to suggest that MACC had concluded its investigation into Nazlan and submitted its report to the AGC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This prompted Umno secretary-general Ahmad Maslan to urge MACC to confirm the documents’ authenticity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad pointed out that on May 21, MACC said it had concluded its probe into the appellate judge and submitted its investigation papers to the AGC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nazlan, who was promoted to the Court of Appeal in February, was the judge who presided over Najib’s SRC trial in the High Court and sentenced the former prime minister to 12 years’ jail and a RM210 million fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday, the Federal Court dismissed Najib’s application to adduce fresh evidence to prove that Nazlan was under a serious conflict of interest when presiding over the SRC trial two years ago

            <p>

            <p>
                On Aug 16, the court had dismissed Hisyam’s application to postpone the appeal hearing and ordered the appeal to proceed on Aug 18

            <p>
                Last December, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s decision and dismissed Najib’s appeal to set aside his conviction and jail sentence as well as the fine

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Mohamed Haniff Khatri Abdulla said this is because the court could decide based on the written submissions filed previously by Najib's defence team at the Court of Appeal last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Lim Wei Jiet also concurred, saying that as the country's highest court, it will likely decide based on the grounds of appeal in the memorandum of appeal, appeal records as well as the Court of Appeal's previous submissions by Najib's defence team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The lawyer once again asked the court to postpone the hearing to Thursday (Aug 25) as he has other cases on Tuesday (Aug 23) and Wednesday (Aug 24), but it was rejected by the court as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 16, the court dismissed Hisyam's application to postpone the appeal hearing and ordered the appeal to proceed on Aug 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision and dismissed Najib's appeal to set aside his conviction and jail sentence as well as the fine

                Ismail Sabri also suggested that more serious efforts be made to appoint more engineers to fill strategic and policy-making positions in the public service

                Penang deputy police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Fisol Salleh (second leftt) with other police personnel looking at two motorcycles that have been confiscated at the Southwest District Police Headquarters in Balik Pulau, Penang.

                This could happen once the police applies to impose these penalties against negligent parents under Section 33 of the Child Act 2001 in order to hold parents accountable when their underaged children end up as illegal racers, said Penang deputy police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Fisol Salleh

            <p>
                It is your duty as a parent to know what your children are doing,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The July 17 crash related to illegal racing killed Mohd Haziq Harris, 34, Muhammad Shazwan Hakim Mohd Abdul Sani, 22, Muhammad Eizreel Muhamad Roszaidi, 25, Ahmad Haikal Naif Ahmad Nazrul, 19, and Muhammad Harith Zikri Yusnizar, 17.Another rider who was injured, Muhammad Rahimi Shukor, 19, was discharged from hospital, while Muhammad Shazwan Hafiz Mohd Abdul Sani, 22, was transferred to a private hospital.

            </p>

                Hadi went on to say that it has become PAS’ responsibility to raise awareness among Malays about the importance of taking part in the country’s politics

                On Thursday, lawyers acting on behalf of the Crackhouse Comedy Club’s owners said they would initiate legal action against KL mayor Mahadi Che Ngah unless he reversed the order to revoke the club’s operating licence and blacklist the owners from registering any other business

            <p>
                The blacklisting follows the suspension of the comedy club by DBKL early last month over a video clip that went viral

                “If this continues and the government intends to break the spirit of the youth, the future of the younger generation is in jeopardy and the fate of Malaysia is very dark,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Thursday, Amanah’s Hasbie Muda, Batu PKR youth chief Sabda Suluh Lestari Yahya and student activist Aliff Naif Mohd Fizam, were charged with failing to notify the police five days before staging their gatherings in protest of recent issues

            <p>
                “If the freedom of expression by the youth continues to be suppressed and they continue to be dragged to court, there will be no future for them,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasbie’s charge was related to an event he had allegedly organised at Masjid Jamek, Kampung Baru on July 1, while Sabda’s charge concerned a protest in front of the Sogo shopping complex on July 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aliff’s charge also involved a protest against the rise in the price of goods, held in front of Sogo on July 23

            <p>
                Pakatan Harapan (PH) Youth later slammed the authorities for charging the three, claiming it was “politically motivated” and intended to “intimidate the youth”

                “If this continues and the government intends to break the spirit of the youth, the future of the younger generation is in jeopardy and the fate of Malaysia is very dark,” he said in a statement
            </p>

                On Thursday, Amanah’s Hasbie Muda, Batu PKR youth chief Sabda Suluh Lestari Yahya and student activist Aliff Naif Mohd Fizam, were charged with failing to notify the police five days before staging their gatherings in protest of recent issues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If the freedom of expression by the youth continues to be suppressed and they continue to be dragged to court, there will be no future for them,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasbie’s charge was related to an event he had allegedly organised at Masjid Jamek, Kampung Baru on July 1, while Sabda’s charge concerned a protest in front of the Sogo shopping complex on July 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aliff’s charge also involved a protest against the rise in the price of goods, held in front of Sogo on July 23
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pakatan Harapan (PH) Youth later slammed the authorities for charging the three, claiming it was “politically motivated” and intended to “intimidate the youth”

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 20 — Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob was an unexpected choice to succeed Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, but political observers believe his appointment as Malaysia’s ninth prime minister last year is keeping the nation moving forward through economic and political crises both at home and globally

            <p>
                Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia political analyst Kartini Aboo Talib commended Ismail Sabri for enlarging his “Keluarga Malaysia” concept to “Keluarga Global” as instrumental for political stability within Asean during the Covid-19 era

            <p>
                Incidental nation-builder Universiti Sains Malaysia’s political scientist Ahmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid said that Ismail Sabri’s ability to weather the storm shaking Malaysia’s political stability might have helped the 62-year-old increase his support among Malaysians

                Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, an associate director with Vriens & Partners — a public policy, government affairs and political risk consultancy — said Ismail Sabri’s biggest contribution in his first year as PM was showing he has political will to push through institutional and health reforms

                Ravinthran, and Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, also affirmed the decision of the High Court that disallowed Aminah Abdullah’s application for a declaration that six million shares in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd were also part of her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision in an online proceeding yesterday, dismissed the appeal brought by Jamaluddin’s children – Ikhwan Hafiz and Nur Anis – and the cross-appeal by Aminah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah was appealing against the High Court’s dismissal of her application to include the Alpine Motion and Ivory Insights shares as part of her son’s estate, while her grandchildren were appealing against the High Court’s ruling to put the Rantai Wawasan shares in the list of their father’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan said the Rantai Wawasan shares should be included in Jamaluddin’s estate as the trust deed which was created in 2009 when Jamaluddin was alive was valid and that the trust deed created in 2015 by Jamaluddin’s children after his (Jamaluddin’s) demise was null and void
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah is seeking to include the three million Rantai Wawasan shares worth RM1.44bil, six million Alpine Motion shares worth RM233mil and two Ivory Insights shares worth RM80mil in her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her statement of claim, Aminah claimed that her grandchildren failed to enter the shares of the three companies – Rantai Wawasan, Alpine Motion and Ivory Insight – as part of the deceased’s estate with the intention of denying her rights and interests as a beneficiary

            <p>
                The state government has said it intends to table a motion in the state assembly to declare the seats vacant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The assembly will meet in October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He contended that the provision in the state constitution is valid, based on a recent unanimous decision of the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We also want to know the court’s decision regarding this issue after the Federal Court’s ruling,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any special sitting (of the state assembly to declare the seats vacant) would have to wait for the court decision, he told reporters in response to a call by DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng for a special sitting of the Penang state assembly

                “Can Zahid explain his silence on his primary role in the RM9 billion LCS scandal, which had exposed his earlier constant denials that he was to be blamed for the RM9 billion LCS scandal as lies?” he asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The JKSTUPKK report disclosed that Zahid, as defence minister in 2011, had sided with the contractor, Boustead Naval Shipyard (BNS) instead of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN), the end-user for the six LCS ordered by the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim said Zahid owes the public an explanation on why he ignored the RMN’s recommendation for Sigma LCS and instead unilaterally chose to go with the Gowind LCS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim also asked the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission to explain why it has yet to charge anyone directly for the RM9 billion LCS scandal

            <p>
                He also took to task Defence Minister Datuk Hishamuddin Hussein for still keeping quiet about his ministry’s decision to halve the number of LCS that must be completed and delivered to the RMN by the contractor with no additional government funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When Hishammuddin appeared before the Public Accounts Committee on 25th January 2022, he spoke about ‘corporate restructuring’ of the RM9 billion LCS contract and that the contractor, BNS, will have to deliver two LCS without any new cost to the government
