                Premier League • England Talk of Inter Milan centre-back Alessandro Bastoni joining Tottenham has once again intensified following events over last weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And now, following events on Sunday, Tottenham are once again being linked with Bastoni
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It was the 23-year-old Italian centre-back’s first booking of the Serie A season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bastoni’s current deal runs out in the summer of 2024, meaning he could decide to start running it down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bastoni fits perfectly as the left-sided centre-back in Conte’s back-three system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spurs are back in Premier League action on Saturday October 1 when they head to Arsenal

                Premier League • England Talk of Inter Milan centre-back Alessandro Bastoni joining Tottenham has once again intensified following events over last weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And now, following events on Sunday, Tottenham are once again being linked with Bastoni
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It was the 23-year-old Italian centre-back’s first booking of the Serie A season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bastoni’s current deal runs out in the summer of 2024, meaning he could decide to start running it down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bastoni fits perfectly as the left-sided centre-back in Conte’s back-three system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Spurs are back in Premier League action on Saturday October 1 when they head to Arsenal

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Sept 22 — The Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) plans to establish a university that specifically caters for women, which indirectly would increase Malaysia’s visibility in higher education and further strengthen its position as an international higher education hub

            <p>
                Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Noraini Ahmad said currently the number of women enrolled in local public higher education institutions is more than 350,000 which constitutes 61 per cent of the overall student enrolment, while more than 530,000, which is 53 per cent of female students, are enrolled in local private higher education institutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noraini added that in the QS World University Rankings (WUR) 2023, there is only one local university listed in the top 100 and four out of five local research universities are listed in the top 200
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noraini said the MOHE are committed to enhancing cooperation and reducing barriers in education services with its international counterparts

                Arthur was the man they pushed for as they secured a loan deal from Juventus for the Brazil star.  It’s difficult enough trying to meet the demands of Klopp, but with Arthur being behind as it is, he has some serious catching up to do

            <p>

            <p>
                This is a big chance for him to still play for a top team and he is putting everything into it.  “Barry (Lewtas) is the manager of the second team, the U21s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from (Arthur) asking to play (for U21s against Rochdale), it looks like he has his own chef, his own fitness coach and physio.  “So, it looks like he wants to get back to his best
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s exciting he wants to put everything into it.” CAN ARTHUR MAKE THE LOAN DEAL PERMANENT? There isn’t a clause in Arthur’s contract which suggests that Liverpool will buy him at the end of the season

                The former left-back spoke about Liverpool’s deadline day loan signing and how he is a ‘very, very talented’ player, who has brought his own chef, fitness coach and physio with him to England
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arthur was the man they pushed for as they secured a loan deal from Juventus for the Brazil star.  It’s difficult enough trying to meet the demands of Klopp, but with Arthur being behind as it is, he has some serious catching up to do
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He’s a very, very talented player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is a big chance for him to still play for a top team and he is putting everything into it.  “Barry (Lewtas) is the manager of the second team, the U21s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from (Arthur) asking to play (for U21s against Rochdale), it looks like he has his own chef, his own fitness coach and physio.  “So, it looks like he wants to get back to his best
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s exciting he wants to put everything into it.” CAN ARTHUR MAKE THE LOAN DEAL PERMANENT? There isn’t a clause in Arthur’s contract which suggests that Liverpool will buy him at the end of the season

                The decision, which was unanimous, takes the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate to 3% to 3.25% -- the highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis, and up from near zero at the start of this year

                Earlier, Gunamalar told the court that Muhammad Nagahswaran, the respondent, violated a court order when he abducted their three children — a pair of 14-year-old twin girls and a 10-year-old boy

                On June 15, the High Court dismissed the Perlis Islamic Religious and Malay Customs Council’s (MAIPs) application to intervene in a divorce petition between Loh and Muhammad Nagahswaran so that it would have locus standi to apply for a variation on the terms of the sole custody order granted to Loh

            <p>
                Without the M Sport package, the facelift 3 Series projects get a smaller centre opening on the front bumper with larger inlets on each side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Eagle eyed readers will notice that the 3 Series’ interior design was inspired by the BMW i4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Powertrains options are aplenty for the new 3 Series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If he wants it, what’s your problem with what he wants? 3 Series is good to have adaptive cruise control (Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go) I like this interior

                In addition, given that Malaysia has very high food imports, the food costs for many in Malaysia are expected to soar.   Malaysia’s unbridled politicking is not helping the ringgit situation either

            <p>
                Research in economics and finance over the decades established that the strongest predictors of an imminent speculative attack on a currency are the behaviour of the home country’s international reserves, the real exchange rate, domestic credit, credit of the public sector, and domestic inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This strategy of currency defeat is also not an option in case of rising domestic inflation, as it will undoubtedly send domestic inflation to new highs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low foreign reserves (that are potentially sliding lower) is critical for a country that highly depends on food imports (RM63.3 billion in 2021)

            <p>
                After all, the interest rate hike is also believed to ward off currency depreciation

                At the same time, the depreciating ringgit makes it unattractive for foreign investors to invest in local production as they take their profits in foreign currencies unless it is a foreign-denominated debt which exposes Malaysia to other risks of depreciating ringgit
