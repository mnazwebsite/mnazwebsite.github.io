                Ad hoc prosecutor V Sithambaram said Low, Najib’s late principal private secretary Azlin Alias and former SRC International CEO Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil were in charge of making sure there were sufficient funds in Najib’s accounts

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The former (Ambank) relationship manager (Joanna Yu) said she used BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) to communicate with Jho Low and Nik Faisal on when funds are coming or when the funds in the accounts are low,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yu was the Ambank relationship manager who handled Najib’s accounts in the bank

                Sithambaram pointed out that when the prosecution had cross-examined Najib previously, he admitted that he communicated with Low and Azlin to make sure there was “sufficient money” in his accounts

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The report revealed that Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi was solely responsible for the RM9 billion LCS scandal, unless there were “hidden hands” behind Zahid
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Contractor chose LCS design Can Zahid explain why he failed to prioritise the RMN in choosing the design of the ships and why instead he chose Gowind LCS, overturning his earlier decision in favour of Sigma LCS as recommended by RMN, without first referring to or discussing with RMN as the end-user? Near the tail-end of the report contained a request letter dated July 8, 2010, from then BNS managing director and vice-executive chairperson Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor to Zahid for a letter of intent from the government for the LCS project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                I observed the three charges against Ramli had nothing to do with the LCS scandal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                All three charges were before the issue of the LOA (Letter of Award) for the LCS procurement which was issued on Dec 16, 2011
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As the three charges against Ramli pre-date the issue of LOA for the LCS procurement, which meant they related to other defence procurement scandals, can MACC explain why after 10 years, the MACC failed to prefer a single charge against anyone for the RM9 billion LCS scandal? Can the MACC say how many people will be charged for the scandal? Additional govt funds Hishamuddin said after the cabinet meeting on Wednesday that the ongoing construction of the first LCS will not involve new allocations from the government
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When Hishammuddin appeared before the PAC on Jan 25, 2022, he spoke about the “corporate restructuring” of the RM9 billion LCS contract and that the contractor, BNS, will have to deliver two LCS without any new cost to the government

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, Najib explained that he opted to discharge Muhammad Shafee and team after losing both his case and his appeal at the High Court and the Court of Appeal respectively
            </p>

                The Court of Appeal had on December 8, 2021 upheld the High Court’s July 2020 verdict and sentence of 12 years in prison and a fine of RM210 million meted against Najib

                In the SRC International court case, he was the High Court judge assigned to hear the case immaterial of the fact he was an employee of Maybank during the time of the SRC dealings, and all parties had full knowledge of his employment and functions before Najib's case was heard

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 19 — Lawyers have warned that the Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s (DBKL) ban on a popular comedy centre in Kuala Lumpur and its owners from opening any businesses sets a bad precedent that is tantamount to power abuse and infringing the right of life that is guaranteed to all, under the Federal Constitution

                Dang Wangi district police chief ACP Noor Dellhan Yahaya said the 41-year-old man was arrested after a report was lodged over the matter when it went viral on TikTok

                Masidi reportedly said there was no problem with the other oil and gas companies operating in Sabah as they had been paying the SST on time

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Sabah would be able to rake in RM1.2 billion annually if all of the firms had paid the SST on time
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Masidi who is also state local government and housing minister reportedly said the issue was “being dealt with” by Sabah and Petronas, while the state government would pursue the matter within its legal power
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In July, Masidi told the state assembly that Sabah would cancel the work permits of the two firms if they failed to settle the RM97 million in SST owed to the state

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the two companies were issued notices on the overdue SST on June 21, with the amount set to be settled within 30 days

                In calling for the charges to be dropped, the youth wing leaders of PH component parties said the charges were a waste of court resources and that such charges were meant to “intimidate the youth”

                Earlier today, Hasbie, Batu PKR youth chief Sabda Suluh Lestari Yahya and student activist Aliff Naif Mohd Fizam, were charged with failing to notify the police five days before staging their gatherings

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hasbie’s charge was related to an event he had allegedly organised at Masjid Jamek, Kampung Baru on July 1, while Sabda’s charge concerned a protest in front of the Sogo shopping complex on July 9

                Ahmad Maslan noted the Federal Court’s unanimous decision to reject Najib’s bid to add in purported new evidence regarding Mohd Nazlan’s purported conflict of interest, and the MACC investigation paper on the judge having been sent to the Attorney General’s Chambers since May 18 or three months ago
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the months leading up to Najib’s final SRC appeal hearing at the Federal Court, wild allegations have been made online against Mohd Nazlan in what appears to be mudslinging attempts against him
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Tuesday, the Federal Court’s five-judge panel unanimously rejected Najib’s bid to ultimately seek for a retrial, pointing out that the purported “new” evidence was actually evidence already available before the SRC trial began in 2019 and Mohd Nazlan’s previous Maybank role was already known to Najib’s lawyers back then
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Federal Court had also said the purported new oral and documentary evidence which Najib wanted to add to the SRC case were “irrelevant” to the criminal charges against him and failed to show conflict of interest by Mohd Nazlan

                The Federal Court said the rejection of the application to add evidence to the SRC case would not result in miscarriage of justice, as such evidence was already available at the SRC trial or could have been discovered then through reasonable diligence and were also totally irrelevant to the charges, and as Najib could still challenge the High Court and Court of Appeal judgments in the SRC appeal at the Federal Court

                The invoice is sent by one company, but the payment instructions say the invoice is to be paid to an account registered under a company with an almost same name, but is a different company," the former federal lawmaker claimed

                Rafizi noted that Alizes Marine was appointed as a "sub-contractor" to supply spare parts for the LCS project on recommendation of a French subcontractor, DCNS

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Alizes Marine Ltd was proposed as the French defence supplier company, under the name of Alizes Marine France

                However, this information is incorrect, as the company does not have a licence but is only an offshore company with no operations

                “Although the LCS project received invoices that appeared to come from Alizes Marine France, the payments are actually made to an account in Singapore, owned by another company using the name Alizes Marine Ltd

                RECENTLY, it has been said that a lawyer climbed across balconies into an adjacent unit to record a video of a neighbour bathing

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As their toilets were next to each other, Yeo could tell when the victim was in the shower by listening for her voice or the sound of videos playing
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the evening of Nov 23, 2020, he deduced that she was bathing and climbed over the parapet and into her balcony to film her
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He held his phone outside the shower window but the victim caught a glimpse of the phone before he could start recording
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He later deleted the video

                UTM vice-chancellor Ahmad Fauzi Ismail said the university had nothing to do with the case, and the student was also from a different public university

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 18 — Lawyers representing the co-owners of the Crackhouse Comedy Club have demanded that the Kuala Lumpur mayor reverse the ban on the premises and its owners’ freedom to open businesses in Kuala Lumpur, within two days
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The letter reportedly said that Crackhouse Comedy Club owners were not officially notified about the revocation of the club’s licence and the blacklisting, adding that they had never been found guilty of any offence that justified the Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s (DBKL) decision
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                National news agency Bernama yesterday reported Deputy Federal Territories Minister Datuk Seri Jalaluddin Alias as saying that DBKL had blacklisted the owners of the Crackhouse Comedy Club for life, for violating the terms of its licence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Jalaluddin said the club’s business was revoked effective July 30 and the names of the club’s owners were blacklisted for life
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the individuals concerned can also no longer obtain a business licence in Kuala Lumpur, even if they were to use a different company name or attempt to run a different business
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On July 10, Jalaluddin was reported to have said that the premises was operating without the correct licence because it only had a restaurant licence and not an entertainment one

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They were charged under Section 448 of the Penal Code which provides for a maximum prison sentence of three years or a fine of up to RM5,000 or both, if convicted

                N Sundra Rajoo said the Federal Court last year had concluded that Thomas had acted in excess of authority in failing to give due regard to his (Sundra’s) immunity
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The plaintiff (Sundra) denies that Thomas had properly exercised his discretion under Article 145(3) of the Federal Constitution,” he said in reply to Thomas’ defence filed early this month
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sundra, in his statement in reply, said Thomas also did not act honestly as he was aware that Sundra enjoyed immunity from prosecution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sundra said by Thomas’s own conduct, he recognised that a waiver had to be given by the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organisation (AALCO) and not Sundra’s successor, the late Vinayak Pradhan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said it was similarly not open to Thomas to contend that Sundra’s immunity violated the equality clause under Article 8 of the constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The apex court said Sundra’s functional immunity included immunity from criminal proceedings and that he had acted to safeguard the interests of AIAC and AALCO

                Acting Perak police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Azizi Mat Aris said the incident was believed to have been triggered by a heated argument between the 69-year-old taxi driver and his 67-year-old brother

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "The deceased, a former trader, was found covered in blood in the kitchen while the taxi driver's body was found outside the house," he told a press conference near the house on Thursday (Aug 18)

                "We also found a knife, believed to be the murder weapon, next to the taxi driver," he said, adding that the police were informed of the incident at about 10am Thursday

                Hamzah said an earlier meeting between Ismail Sabri Yaakob and several PN leaders was unofficial and leaned more towards casual talk

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I have asked for a new official date so that the PN representatives can meet with the PM and discuss our requests.” Prior to this, PN treasurer Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar said he and Hamzah had a lunch meeting with Ismail
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The PN representatives previously identified to meet officially with the prime minister were Hamzah, Ahmad, Supreme Council member Takiyuddin Hassan and information chief Azmin Ali

                Asked if the PN representatives had also brought up the issue of the deputy prime minister’s post in their unofficial meeting with Ismail, Hamzah said “no” and that their discussions were focused on current political issues

                Thursday, 18 Aug 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A Federal Court panel comprising Tan Sri Azahar Mohamed, Datuk Seri Hasnah Mohammed Hashim and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais delivered the decision on Aug 17, 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Federal Court decision reflects the seriousness of the breaches and reinforces the robustness of the SC’s Audit Oversight Board’s (AOB) enforcement framework, the SC said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In addition, the AOB also imposed fines of RM455,000 on AFTAAS, and RM88,000 each on Mohd Afrizan and Khairul, respectively
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                With the Federal Court decision, the stay on the AOB’s enforcement decisions until the disposal of the leave application to the Federal Court obtained by AFTAAS and its partners at the Court of Appeal on Feb 11, 2022, has lapsed
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As such, the sanctions imposed by the AOB in its enforcement decision including the prohibitions shall take effect from Aug 17, 2022

                In a joint statement, the duo also lambasted the delay in declassifying the PH ordered forensic audit, and shared several excerpts from the Proceeding Report (Hansard) of the Public Account Committee (PAC) dated March 8, which they claim provides details of the audit results

                “The Government Governance, Procurement and Finance Investigation Committee (JKSTUPKK) report was declassified yesterday but the forensic audit report and the former admiral of the Navy Tan Sri Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor's letter of reprimand have not yet been declassified

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “However, the findings of this forensic audit are also shocking,” they said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former ministers said that on Page 27 of the PAC proceedings report, Prabhat Kumar, the executive director of Alliance Investigative and Forensic Accounting, testified to the PAC that those involved had no intention to deliver the LCS project, but only had intentions to maximise their own gains
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On page 22, En Prabhat Kumar says that ‘It is clear that in the case of the LCS programme, Anuar bin Murad sidestepped the authority of all of his subordinates, and acted in a manner as if they were only two persons in the whole organisation’.” “It is an outright conflict of interest whereby Tan Sri Ramli is the chairman of the LCS Steering Committee and CAD, and at the same time also the Managing Director of BHIC,” they said.

                His comments were made in response to a government disclosure that the upcoming political funding bill could include a provision to prohibit donations to political parties from GLCs that have contracts with the government

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Political appointments to GLCs has become a common practice in Malaysia

                For the record, some GLCs have been set up to meet public needs, and politicians, being representatives of the people, would be in a better position to ensure that those objectives are met

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, August 18 — Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan has dismissed claims that Malaysia will hold its 15th general election on October 8 as mere speculation

                He said no one but Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob can give the exact date of the next national polls, Sinar Harian reported today

                Hishammuddin said yesterday the ongoing construction of the first LCS (LCS 1), which was to have been delivered to the navy in 2019, will not involve new allocations from the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Lim noted that when Hishammuddin appeared before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Jan 25, he said Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) would have to deliver two LCS without any additional cost to the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Hishammuddin should explain why the defence ministry has reduced from two LCS to one LCS which must be completed and delivered by the contractor with no additional government funds,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his testimony before the PAC, Hishammuddin had said that if the government wanted to proceed with the project, “we cannot put all the money upfront if Boustead doesn’t commit to being able to deliver at least two ships”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the Hansard sighted by FMT, he said that completing the first two LCS “will not affect upfront payment” as they are “still under the contractual amount”
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At a defence ministry event, Hishammuddin told reporters that additional allocations for BNS to complete the remaining five LCS would only be considered after completion of LCS 1 in reportedly another two years

                The Human Resources Minister said the scheme to cover homemakers against injuries suffered while tending to their chores would be managed by the Social Security Organisation (Socso)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On July 26, the Dewan Rakyat passed the Housewives Social Security Bill (HSS), which allows husbands to voluntarily contribute to the scheme for their wives below the age of 55
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked if the definition of housewife would be widened to cover husbands who assume the role of homemakers as well, Saravanan said the ministry would need an in-depth study to see the number of house husbands involved
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “No action would be taken against any husband who did not contribute.” However, he noted that husbands who have signed up to contribute and failed to maintain it monthly would be fined RM10,000

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saravanan also said the amendments passed in the Employment Insurance System Act 2017 (Act 800) and Employees’ Social Security Act 1969 (Act 4) to increase the maximum monthly salary ceiling limit from RM4,000 to RM5,000 would come into effect next month

                In a statement, the federation’s president Datuk Dr Syed Hussain Syed Husman said economic growth in the second half of this year is expected to slow to between 5% and 6%, compared with 8.9% reported in the second quarter
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that some employers were already struggling to fully implement the new minimum wage of RM1,500 per month that took effect in May, which was estimated to cost them an additional RM14 billion per year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that employers will find it very difficult to absorb the additional RM110.99 billion cost per year, as supply chain issues from the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war continue to rock the global markets

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Jasin OCPD Deputy Supt Mispani Hamdan said the elderly couple was walking along the street at about 11.30am on Tuesday (Aug 16), when an ongoing car hit them, causing them to be tossed into the air
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                DSP Mispani said the driver of the car was heading towards the Jasin market while the couple was walking towards a row of shophouses in the opposite direction
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the couple are in stable condition after receiving treatment at Jasin Hospital
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                DSP Mispani said the driver was shocked that he had unintentionally mowed down his own relatives when he alighted his car to help the victims

                “I am very happy, very proud of Hisyam,” said Zaid, whose law firm is representing Najib in his final appeal to the Federal Court from his conviction and sentence in his SRC International corruption case
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I know he is an honest lawyer, and we can tell an honest lawyer from a dishonest one.”  The former law minister was speaking to the press after the apex court dismissed Najib’s application to adduce fresh evidence to prove that trial judge Nazlan Ghazali was under a serious conflict of interest when presiding over the SRC trial two years ago
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Zaid also commiserated with the former prime minister on the setback he suffered but vowed to stay the course

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, Hisyam told the press of his own dissatisfaction with the apex court’s decision to reject Najib’s motion to adduce further evidence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Unfortunately, the court did not appreciate our arguments.” He also said he was “terribly disappointed and saddened by the stance taken by the Federal Court” in rejecting his legal team’s request to postpone the appeal proper

            <p> </p>

                The statement by the police this evening follows the revelation by the victim, a student at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM), that it had been more than a year since she filed a report about it with the police and the university administration
