                He also spoke about how he got a letter of summons a week after issuing his first statement on the 1MDB scandal

            <p>
                Earlier today, the Federal Court affirmed Najib’s conviction on all seven charges brought against him for abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering involving RM42 million of funds belonging to SRC International
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The people are in power, says Anwar PKR president, Anwar Ibrahim, meanwhile, attributed the Federal Court’s decision to the people’s power, as voters had in the last general election decided to back Pakatan Harapan to rid the country of corruption and ensure an independent judiciary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It was the people’s decision (in GE14) that enabled a professional prosecution as well as the firmness and bravery of the judiciary to make the decision based on facts and the law, not based on the political decision made by those in power that we experienced for decades,” said Anwar in a video statement on his Facebook page
            </p>

                Earlier today, the Federal Court affirmed Najib’s conviction on all seven charges brought against him for abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering involving RM42 million of funds belonging to SRC International
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The people are in power, says Anwar PKR president, Anwar Ibrahim, meanwhile, attributed the Federal Court’s decision to the people’s power, as voters had in the last general election decided to back Pakatan Harapan to rid the country of corruption and ensure an independent judiciary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It was the people’s decision (in GE14) that enabled a professional prosecution as well as the firmness and bravery of the judiciary to make the decision based on facts and the law, not based on the political decision made by those in power that we experienced for decades,” said Anwar in a video statement on his Facebook page

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Ahmad Zahid disagreed with the prosecution's suggestion that he often blamed others while testifying in court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In proceedings on Tuesday, Ahmad Zahid's lawyer Hamidi Mohd Noh said that the defence will call 43 witnesses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid's defence team previously informed the court that it would call 20 witnesses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Jan 24, the court ordered Ahmad Zahid to enter his defence on the 47 charges

                Rafizi said there was “enough evidence” to back his claim that the woman, Zainab Mohd Salleh, was Abd Latiff Ahmad’s wife

            <p>
                The evidence, he said, could be found in a recently declassified audit report by Boustead Heavy Industries Corp naming Zainab as Latiff’s wife as well as the pair’s connection to offshore companies linked to the project

            <p>
                He also said the schemes to misappropriate LCS funds using companies allegedly linked to Latiff, who was the then deputy defence minister, was no coincidence

                The New Generation Patrol Vessel project called for the construction of 27 patrol vessels, but only six ships were eventually completed, with the cost going up from RM5.35 billion to a total of RM6.75 billion through an additional contract

                A PAC report two weeks ago said that funds meant for the troubled RM9 billion littoral combat ship project had been used to resolve debts from the NGPV project

            <p>
                PAC chief Wong Kah Woh called for the NGPV report to be declassified since the LCS contractor, Boustead Naval Shipyard, had used funds meant for that project to resolve debts related to the patrol vessel project

                ‘Another Boustead audit needed on LCS’ Wong also urged the Cabinet to order the shipyard’s controlling shareholder Boustead Heavy Industries Corporation to conduct a further forensic audit on the late delivery of navy frigates in the LCS project

            <p>
                He said the report showed that there had yet to be an in-depth probe into all activities related to the project’s implementation up until 2018, which meant that some important facts could have been left out

                Mahathir sought a full royal pardon for his former ally after they joined forces to win the elections that year, on the back of public anger on Najib’s handling of 1MDB

                In Mahathir’s second term as prime minister from 2018, dozens of criminal charges were filed against Najib for corruption, money laundering and criminal breach of trust

                “It’s mind blowing.” A national election this time around would be much closer, Mahathir said, and no party is likely to win outright

                He will come back and he wants to become the prime minister once again,” Mahathir said in an interview with the Bloomberg news agency today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has appealed against the conviction and sentence, and the case is being heard by the Federal Court, with Najib’s counsel instructed by the court to make his submissions tomorrow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mahathir said that should the court uphold Najib’s conviction and jail sentence, “of course he’s going to ask for a pardon”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the Federal Court upholds Najib’s conviction, he will go to jail and will not be able to contest in the next general election, which must be held by September next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mahathir said the next general election would be much closer, with no party likely to win outright
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, people in his party “get very upset if I say I’m not contesting,” he said

                He will come back and he wants to become the prime minister once again,” Mahathir said in an interview with the Bloomberg news agency today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has appealed against the conviction and sentence, and the case is being heard by the Federal Court, with Najib’s counsel instructed by the court to make his submissions tomorrow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mahathir said that should the court uphold Najib’s conviction and jail sentence, “of course he’s going to ask for a pardon”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the Federal Court upholds Najib’s conviction, he will go to jail and will not be able to contest in the next general election, which must be held by September next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mahathir said the next general election would be much closer, with no party likely to win outright
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, people in his party “get very upset if I say I’m not contesting,” he said

                Ampang Jaya district police chief Farouk Eshak said the two suspects, aged 35 and 40, were arrested at a terrace house in Taman Seri Asahan, Jasin, Melaka, at about 3am today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said at about 6.50am on Saturday, the two suspects, claiming to be immigration officers, approached two Indonesian women near a hospital in Pandan Indah, Ampang, Selangor, purportedly wanting to check their passports and permits

            <p>
                “The two women were taken to an area in Serdang and during the journey, the suspects took jewellery and cash belonging to the victims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said further investigations revealed that the 40-year-old suspect had 18 prior arrests for criminal and drug offences, while the 35-year-old suspect had 13 prior arrests
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Farouk said the two suspects were brought to the Ampang court today for a remand application under Section 117 of the Criminal Procedure Code to assist in investigations

                The defence wanted to challenge the credibility of the 13th prosecution witness, Rafiq Hakim Razali, who is the former Angkatan Bersatu Anak Muda (Armada) assistant treasurer, following discrepancies between his testimony in court and the statement recorded from him by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) in 2020 on the withdrawal of RM1 million from Armada’s bank account

            <p>
                Therefore, the application by defence to challenge the credibility of the witness is dismissed,” he said

                Lawyer Gobind Singh Deo, representing Syed Saddiq, then requested that a copy of the witness statement recorded by MACC be handed over to the defence, and the court set this afternoon to hear the application

            <p>
                On July 25, the High Court ordered the prosecution to give a copy of the witness statement recorded by MACC in 2020 to the court for scrutiny and consideration

                On the second charge, Syed Saddiq is alleged to have misused property for himself, namely RM120,000 from the Maybank Islamic Bhd account belonging to Armada Bumi Bersatu Enterprise, by causing Rafiq Hakim to dispose of the money between April 8 and 21, 2018

                “Penang is well known for being the heartland of Pakatan Harapan (PH)-DAP, so the agenda of unifying Malay parties is even more important here to prevent PH from taking advantage of any split in Malay-Muslim votes,” he said

                “The slogan ‘Islam unites the ummah’ should be backed by all PAS supporters, so that efforts to unite Malay political parties are successful and in line with shariah and party policy.” Razib said the parties, which he did not name, must be committed towards this cause to ensure Malay-Muslim interests were not denied and neglected in Penang

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — PKR deputy president Rafizi Ramli claimed money for the littoral combat ship (LCS) project was funnelled into offshore companies owned by the wife of a former deputy minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said, in a statement, he received this information from internal investigations into the LCS scandal and from cross-checking with the database of offshore companies in the Paradise Papers, a 2017 tranche of leaked confidential records related to offshore investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that it would have been impossible for then Finance Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and then Defence Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to not have known about this as it occurred with projects that they both managed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Thursday, Rafizi claimed that RM192 million had been funnelled from the LCS project to nonexistent, untraceable offshore accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fake companies are set up all over the world whose name is identical to a real company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The invoice is sent from one company, but the payment instructions are for the invoice to be paid to an account registered under a company whose name is almost the same but a different company,” Rafizi said.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — PKR deputy president Rafizi Ramli claimed money for the littoral combat ship (LCS) project was funnelled into offshore companies owned by the wife of a former deputy minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said, in a statement, he received this information from internal investigations into the LCS scandal and from cross-checking with the database of offshore companies in the Paradise Papers, a 2017 tranche of leaked confidential records related to offshore investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that it would have been impossible for then Finance Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and then Defence Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to not have known about this as it occurred with projects that they both managed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Thursday, Rafizi claimed that RM192 million had been funnelled from the LCS project to nonexistent, untraceable offshore accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fake companies are set up all over the world whose name is identical to a real company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The invoice is sent from one company, but the payment instructions are for the invoice to be paid to an account registered under a company whose name is almost the same but a different company,” Rafizi said.

                Bersatu Supreme Council member Razali Idris said Muhyiddin had done his best during multiple rounds of negotiations but the appointment of a deputy prime minister was the sole prerogative of Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If the prime minister does not want to make the appointment, we must accept it,” he told FMT
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The appointment of senior ministers was first made by Muhyiddin when he became prime minister in 2020, and emulated by Ismail when he took over in August last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The agreement called for a deputy prime minister to be appointed from Bersatu, the coalition said in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nonetheless, Razali said discussions between PN and Ismail must continue as there remained several unresolved issues between the coalition and the prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Just because the prime minister does not see a need to appoint a deputy, it does not mean further meetings with PN should stop,” he said

            <p>
                Bersatu Supreme Council member Razali Idris said Muhyiddin had done his best during multiple rounds of negotiations but the appointment of a deputy prime minister was the sole prerogative of Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If the prime minister does not want to make the appointment, we must accept it,” he told FMT
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The appointment of senior ministers was first made by Muhyiddin when he became prime minister in 2020, and emulated by Ismail when he took over in August last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The agreement called for a deputy prime minister to be appointed from Bersatu, the coalition said in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nonetheless, Razali said discussions between PN and Ismail must continue as there remained several unresolved issues between the coalition and the prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Just because the prime minister does not see a need to appoint a deputy, it does not mean further meetings with PN should stop,” he said

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Aug 21 — The investigation paper on the trial judge who heard Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s case over the misappropriation of RM42 million of government-owned firm SRC International Sdn Bhd is not with the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC), Tan Sri Idrus Harun said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last week, in a statement posted on Twitter, Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan claimed that a document alleged to be the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) investigation papers on judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali had been leaked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Maslan noted the Federal Court’s unanimous decision to reject Najib’s bid to admit new evidence on Mohd Nazlan’s purported conflict of interest as part of his final appeal over his conviction in the SRC International case, and that the MACC investigation paper on the judge was sent to the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) on May 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then said Umno is of the view that “MACC has to confirm or deny the validity of the investigation papers that have gone viral”, and that the “Attorney General’s Chambers has to announce if there will be further action for those investigation papers”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 23, news portal Malaysiakini reported Idrus as saying that the AGC is still examining the investigation papers by the MACC on Mohd Nazlan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are perusing the investigation paper before we make our decision,” he was quoted as saying via a text message.

                He then said Umno is of the view that “MACC has to confirm or deny the validity of the investigation papers that have gone viral”, and that the “Attorney General’s Chambers has to announce if there will be further action for those investigation papers”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 23, news portal Malaysiakini reported Idrus as saying that the AGC is still examining the investigation papers by the MACC on Mohd Nazlan

                This could happen once the police applies to impose these penalties against negligent parents under Section 33 of the Child Act 2001 in order to hold parents accountable when their underaged children end up as illegal racers, said Penang deputy police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Fisol Salleh

                The minister said many steps were required in the process to amend the Federal Constitution and provide automatic citizenship to overseas-born children of Malaysian women
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court had overturned a ruling by the High Court in September that a constitutional provision for citizenship derived from Malaysian fathers should be extended to cover mothers or either parent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Court of Appeal on Aug 5 held that the constitutional provision referred only to the biological father
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was up to Parliament, not the court, to rewrite the constitution, the judges said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier today, Attorney-General Idrus Harun said the citizenship problem could be resolved by the government amending the Federal Constitution

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Aug 21 — With the Covid-19 pandemic situation stabilising in Singapore, the Government will further relax rules on wearing of face masks in public, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To curb the spread of the coronavirus, people here used to have to put on face masks when they leave their homes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This rule was relaxed from March 29, with the wearing of face masks mandated only in indoor settings, though people were still encouraged to wear them when they leave home, especially in crowded areas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that beyond the infection controls, Singapore must learn the lessons from the pandemic, and be ready for a possible future where “a new virus will emerge, more transmissible, more adaptable and more dangerous than Covid-19”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The most important lesson is to maintain the spirit of personal and social responsibility,” Lee said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Continue to nurture the trust in our society — day in, day out — during normal times, so that during the next crisis, we can again draw upon a deep reservoir of trust to see us through, just like we have done during Covid-19.” In his speech, Lee also announced a new special state award called the Covid-19 Resilience Medal that will be presented to people who played a direct part in the fight against the pandemic.

                The secretariat’s spokesman, Syahmi Shamsudin, said the movement, which comprises 10 organisations and NGOs, would hold talks and protests to urge the public to reject the current government

                The movement, he added, planned to highlight at least 30 issues that arose under Ismail’s government — which celebrates its first year anniversary tomorrow — including inflation, the lack of employment opportunities, price hikes and exorbitant house prices

                On Wednesday, police received a report from a doctor on duty at Hospital Kuala Kangsar about the death of a 25-year-old man who was unconscious when brought in at 8.10pm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The victim had reportedly been talking to himself on Wednesday afternoon and tried to escape but was captured

            <p>
                One of the suspects alleged the victim later tried to injure one of them by using a knife and ran amok
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said they managed to subdue the victim after a scuffle with a warden, who hit the victim’s body several times
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he added, at 4.45pm, the victim tried to escape again and jumped from the stairs of the first floor of the building, which is about 8m-high
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed the victim then hit his head on the floor and wall several times until he bled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A warden found the victim unconscious at 7.45pm and took him to hospital

            <p>
                On Wednesday, police received a report from a doctor on duty at Hospital Kuala Kangsar about the death of a 25-year-old man who was unconscious when brought in at 8.10pm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The victim had reportedly been talking to himself on Wednesday afternoon and tried to escape but was captured
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the suspects alleged the victim later tried to injure one of them by using a knife and ran amok
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said they managed to subdue the victim after a scuffle with a warden, who hit the victim’s body several times
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he added, at 4.45pm, the victim tried to escape again and jumped from the stairs of the first floor of the building, which is about 8m-high
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He claimed the victim then hit his head on the floor and wall several times until he bled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A warden found the victim unconscious at 7.45pm and took him to hospital
            </p>

                Ravinthran, and Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, also affirmed the decision of the High Court that disallowed Aminah Abdullah’s application for a declaration that six million shares in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd were also part of her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision in an online proceeding yesterday, dismissed the appeal brought by Jamaluddin’s children – Ikhwan Hafiz and Nur Anis – and the cross-appeal by Aminah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah was appealing against the High Court’s dismissal of her application to include the Alpine Motion and Ivory Insights shares as part of her son’s estate, while her grandchildren were appealing against the High Court’s ruling to put the Rantai Wawasan shares in the list of their father’s estate

            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan said the Rantai Wawasan shares should be included in Jamaluddin’s estate as the trust deed which was created in 2009 when Jamaluddin was alive was valid and that the trust deed created in 2015 by Jamaluddin’s children after his (Jamaluddin’s) demise was null and void

                Aminah is seeking to include the three million Rantai Wawasan shares worth RM1.44bil, six million Alpine Motion shares worth RM233mil and two Ivory Insights shares worth RM80mil in her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her statement of claim, Aminah claimed that her grandchildren failed to enter the shares of the three companies – Rantai Wawasan, Alpine Motion and Ivory Insight – as part of the deceased’s estate with the intention of denying her rights and interests as a beneficiary

                Dr Mahathir, 97, as the plaintiff filed the defamation suit through Messrs

            <p>
                Haidir & Co on July 20 at the High Court here naming Ahmad Zahid, 69, as the sole defendant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his statement of claim, Dr Mahathir claimed that Ahmad Zahid had issued a defamatory statement against him during the Umno divisional meeting in Kelana Jaya on July 30, 2017 and the statement was reproduced on Astro Awani’s YouTube and several online news portals, which can be accessed by internet users without any restrictions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Ahmad Zahid in his statement of defence filed on August 17 through Messrs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shahrul Hamidi & Haziq, denied that the statement made on July 30 2017 was malicious to slander and harm the reputation of the plaintiff in the public eye
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The plaintiff also needs to file a response to the defendant’s statement of defence before or on Sept 8,” said the lawyer
