                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 5 — Meta, the parent company behind Facebook and Instagram, said in a recent report it had identified and removed over 600 accounts across all its social network platforms for violating the policy against “coordinated inauthentic behaviour”, with most of them alleged to be part of a “troll farm” to corrupt or manipulate public discourse using fake accounts
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Meta said its investigation found that these accounts were linked to the Malaysian police force
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Although the people behind it attempted to conceal their identity and coordination, our investigation found links to the Royal Malaysia Police.” Malay Mail is seeking comments from the police over the accusation
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Meta described “Inauthentic behaviour (IB)” as an effort to mislead people or Facebook about the popularity of content, the goal of a community through groups, pages, events or the identity of the people behind it
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For example, they may use large numbers of low-sophistication fake accounts to mass-post or like their content — be it commercial, social or political,” the company added

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                IB is different from “Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour (CIB)” where operators invest in mimicking human social activity as closely as possible

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 5 — Rafizi Ramli has reportedly said he plans to contest in the Pandan seat that he previously held, replacing Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who won it in 2018

                For the time being, it is safe to say I should be able to contest in Pandan,” Rafizi was quoted saying by The Malaysian Insight

                If we have not settled the candidates by September, we will be in trouble,” said Rafizi, in reference to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri's recent remark that GE15 is close

                Rafizi also stressed his faith in PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as the best prime minister candidate for PH, as he is currently the most prominent figure in the coalition

                Donal Crotty, chairman of the Irish Chamber of Commerce Malaysia, said it appeared that the government had no “real commitment” to the programme, and Center for Market Education CEO Carmelo Ferlito said Putrajaya had sent a message that it sought to attract only people of high net worth

                The MM2H programme is aimed at drawing foreigners for long-term stay in Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, home minister Hamzah Zainudin told the Dewan Rakyat that 1,461 people applied to withdraw from the programme between September last year and June this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hamzah claimed that the withdrawals were not due to the new conditions the government had set
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Crotty said the MM2H was originally built on trust, confidence and security, and the government’s policy changes were detrimental to the programme

                (If that is the case), why not repatriate her to be with Indira Gandhi?” Prasana was taken by her father, Muhammad Riduan Abdullah, formerly known as K Pathmanathan, in 2009 and unilaterally converted to Islam

                The former Penang chief minister said the state assembly should use the emergency sitting to decide on the status of Dr Afif Bahardin (Seberang Jaya) and Zulkifli Ibrahim (Sungai Acheh), who were sacked by PKR in 2020

                Lim, who is Air Putih assemblyman, also noted that Bersatu assemblymen Mehtab Mohd Ishaq (Bertam) and Zolkifly Md Lazim (Telok Bahang) would be exempted from the state’s anti-hopping enactment

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Since the new amendments to the Federal Constitution have not been gazetted yet, the Federal Court ruling effectively means that Section 14A is covered with the force of law and should be applied to the two ex-PKR assemblymen (Afif and Zulkifli)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Wednesday, the apex court declared that the anti-hopping enactment passed by the Penang legislative assembly in 2012 was constitutional

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But the four assemblymen urged Penang to bring the state constitution in line with the proposed amendments to the Federal Constitution dealing with anti-party hopping

                Kamal Salih said MIER had been an advocate of GST since 1988 because it believed in its merits
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I have concerns that MIER’s abandoning of GST in favour of HSST could damage its reputation,” he told FMT when commenting on the think tank’s proposal for a 10% HSST
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                MIER claimed that its proposed alternative would be more efficient than GST and would affect only the most important sectors of the economy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I’ve always said GST must be complemented by tax reforms such as a capital gains tax,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Exemptions and thresholds should be adhered to if GST is to work

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “But in the longer term, we need to seriously think about going back to GST, with improvements based on lessons learned from our first experience with it.” He noted that GST was recognised as an efficient indirect tax system by the European Economic Community, which has made it a prerequisite for any European country seeking to join it

                One of them, who asked not to be named, said if any employer were to get an interview to secure workers, chances were he or she would only get less than half of what was requested

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This, he added, was the shelf life of a local worker in the manufacturing sector, which is why local companies still need to hire foreign workers

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At present, the process of procuring foreign workers in Malaysia is done via the Foreign Workers Centralised Management System (FWCMS) under the Human Resources Ministry

                1MDB, and its subsidiaries, 1MDB Energy Holdings Ltd, 1MDB Energy Ltd and 1MDB Energy (Langat) Ltd filed the application on Jan 28, seeking documents relating to the receipt and use of US$10,173,104 in funds by Red Granite Pictures and US$238 million by Red Granite Capital Ltd

                On May 7, 2021, 1MDB and its subsidiaries sued Riza and his two companies for allegedly receiving around US$248 million in funds that they misused for their personal gain, including financing a film and to purchase various properties

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They also claimed that since Riza managed both companies, he would know that the money originating from 1MDB had been misappropriated for their gain

                Riza in his defence claimed that the funds were obtained from a loan from the Saudi royal family or International Petroleum Investment Company and not from 1MDB, adding that it was hard for an unknown film producer to obtain loans from banks and that had compelled him to seek funds from individuals or companies

                Khaled also took a swipe at the Gerakan Tanah Air line-up, wondering if it was the “face of Malaysia’s future”

            <p> </p>

                “If we are going to talk about the future there has to be young leaders, but look at them, they are all seasoned politicians.” Earlier today, Mahathir unveiled the GTA coalition which comprised Pejuang, Parti Barisan Jemaah Islamiah Se-Malaysia (Berjasa), Parti Bumiputera Perkasa Malaysia (Putra) and the National Indian Muslim Alliance Party (Iman)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Mahathir’s statement that GTA was established to challenge Umno in the coming 15th general election, Khaled said those who offered to stand in the polls should do so to help develop Malaysia “… and not to finish off political parties”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When asked if Umno viewed GTA as a threat, Khaled said that anyone was free to contest in an election

                “In the matter of Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA), which in fact introduced Jho Low to the Sultan, it was however insignificant, as there was no impropriety or corruption in this act, or of being acquainted with Jho Low,” she said in her witness statement

                When explaining her knowledge of Jho Low surrounding the founding of TIA, she said from her research, she knew that Jho Low had links to the royal family of Terengganu, which led to the founding of TIA and later renamed as 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB)

                Prior to 1MDB’s scandal rising to Malaysian public awareness in 2015, Jho Low himself had made it publicly known since 2010 of his involvement in the founding of TIA, through the Sultan of Terengganu

                She further said that Jho Low had links to members of the royal family of Terengganu and this was undisputed public knowledge, as he was friendly with members of that family back in 2009, and was introduced to the Sultan of Terengganu through its members, a fact that Jho Low himself had publicly admitted, without controversy

                "In the matter of Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA), which in fact introduced Jho Low to the Sultan, it was however insignificant, as there was no impropriety or corruption in this act, or of being acquainted with Jho Low,” she said in her witness statement

                In his winding-up speech, Deputy Finance Minister I Datuk Mohd Shahar Abdullah said that the government expects to collect RM200 million with the imposition of the 10 per cent tax, and that the amendment is needed to level the playing field between foreign and local sellers

                Like I said, it is unreasonable, if you want to equalise; we will equalise with the exception of local traders,” he said, adding that the impact on consumers and small traders will be huge should local businesses be spared from the taxation

                In a statement, MAP information chief Mathavan Velayutham also slammed the Seberang Perai City Council (MBSP) over its “ferocious” treatment of two cows that were seized as part of a routine operation to round up strays

                He added that the 44-year-old cowherd was arrested and remanded for two days after pleading with city council officers to release the cattle

                Questioning why a two-day remand was necessary for such a petty issue, he said the magistrate should have just ordered police to take the man’s statement before immediately releasing him

                Rewcastle Brown, who gave evidence from London, said it was an honest mistake when she wrote a passage in 2018 from her recollection of reading news reports in 2010 where the fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, stated how he came to know the Terengganu sultan

                Previously, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the relaxation, which is aimed at simplifying the entry procedure for travellers to Malaysia, was decided due to the current state of the health system, which is at a good and controlled level

                “If we cannot establish the cause of death, then an inquest should be held,” Ramkarpal, who is also the Bukit Gelugor MP, said at a press conference

                Thomas, who held the office of AG between June 2018 and February 2020, said that in his capacity as public prosecutor, he had the discretion under Article 145 (3) of the Federal Constitution and Section 376 of the Criminal Procedure Code to prefer the three charges brought against N Sundra Rajoo
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sundra said he should not have faced prosecution as he enjoyed immunity for acts done as AIAC director, a contention which the Federal Court accepted in judicial review proceedings heard last year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The apex court said Sundra’s functional immunity included immunity from criminal proceedings and that he had acted to safeguard the interests of AIAC and its parent body, the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organisation (AALCO)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Thomas in his defence maintained that the immunity alleged by Sundra violated Article 8 of the constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Thomas also claimed that Sundra, who was the centre’s director since 2010, had included the immunity clause in 2013 which was self-serving, dishonest and constituted fraud
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia is scrambling to protect its assets as the descendants of the last sultan of the remote Philippine region of Sulu look to enforce a U$15 billion (RM67 billion) arbitration award in a dispute over a colonial-era land deal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 1878, two European colonists signed a deal with the sultan for the use of his territory in present-day Malaysia – an agreement that independent Malaysia honoured until 2013, paying the monarch's descendants about $1,000 (about RM5,000) a year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia disputes that, saying the sultanate ceded sovereignty and the arbitration was illegitimate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "The arbitration is a sophisticated fiction, veiled as a legal process," Uria Menendez, a Spanish law firm representing Malaysia, told Reuters
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The heirs rejected Thomas' offer and the arbitration went on without Malaysia's participation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Stampa argued in his award statement that the courts did not have jurisdiction over arbitration, and moved the case to France to deliver the award - actions that Malaysia says were unlawful

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 4 — AirAsia Super App and AirAsia Food owner Capital A Bhd today announced it is offering its gig workers full-time employment with a minimum monthly salary of RM3,000

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As many people know, AirAsia has always been about people, and we believe that people are our greatest asset

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "We don't believe in contract staff and will now move towards employing all riders as full-time employees, receiving the same benefits that every Allstar receives, on top of the excellent benefits from AirAsia food & AirAsia Xpress respectively,” he said during the launching of the event commemorating the new full-time employees
            </p>

                Johor Umno deputy chief Nur Jazlan Mohamed said this came about after PN’s representatives were rejected outright by voters in the recent Melaka and Johor state elections

                He said this was obvious in the way “opportunistic party leaders” kept changing their stand on the cooperation between the Islamic party and Umno in Muafakat Nasional (MN)

                He said this was why Umno leaders and members must not be fooled by the “playacting” by PAS and PN and the masterminds from Umno working with them, as the party could be destroyed

                “The project’s forensic audit report by Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) and the former navy commander’s letter must also be declassified,” they said in a joint statement, adding that BNS had been appointed to carry out a forensic audit in 2019 to identify any leaks, irregularities and abuse of power in the procurement of the ships

                In its decision yesterday, the Apex court states that "Article 14A of the Penang State Constitution is not void as it is not inconsistent with Article 10(1)(c) of the Federal Constitution”

                All four are challenging Penang's anti-party hopping law enacted in 2012 despite a Federal Court ruling on Wednesday (Aug 3) that the law was constitutional

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "We have been informed of the decision by the Federal Court declaring that Article 14A of the Penang Constitution does not infringe the right of freedom of association enshrined in Article 10 of the Federal Constitution,” they said

                "In doing so, the Federal Court changed the law and reversed a 30-year old precedent.We respect the decision of the Federal Court but we disagree with it,” all four added

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The issue of the constitutionality of Article 14(A) was brought before the Federal Court following the action of the four to leave the Pakatan Harapan coalition in 2020

                Tourists look on as a Chinese military helicopter flies past Pingtan island, one of mainland China's closest point from Taiwan, ahead of massive military drills off Taiwan following Pelosi's visit

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It sparked a furious reaction from Beijing, which vowed "punishment" and announced military drills in the seas around Taiwan - some of the world's busiest waterways
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                Taiwan's defence ministry said it was closely watching the drills

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Beijing's nationalist state-run tabloid Global Times said, citing military analysts, that the exercises were "unprecedented" and that missiles would fly over Taiwan for the first time

                "China's announced military exercises represent a clear escalation from the existing baseline of Chinese military activities around Taiwan and from the last Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995-1996," said Amanda Hsiao, senior analyst for China at the International Crisis Group

                Hamzah said Penang police had opened a disciplinary investigation paper against the two traffic policemen for escorting the individual, believed to be the son of a Barisan Nasional (BN) MP

                Hamzah had previously said action could be taken against the MP’s son if the investigation showed he broke the law

                A 20-second clip of the incident showed a car driven by the MP’s son being escorted by two traffic policemen along Jalan Bukit Gambir in Penang

                The delay was criticised by several parties, notably former deputy education minister Teo Nie Ching, as applicants were left in the dark about the status of their applications that were made in May

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The prosecution is seeking a jail term of between five and eight months for Koshy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Koshy also asked them for sexual services in exchange for sums of up to S$2,000 (RM6,455)

                Predatory conduct DPP Lim said that Koshy’s YouTube video, which has since been taken down at the prosecution’s request, sought to reduce his culpability by making “clarifications” designed to sway public sentiments in his favour

                Kepong MP Lim Lip Eng praised MIC for pushing for answers over the matter, despite how it allegedly involved a member of Bersatu, a party MIC is working with in the government

                “I stand with MIC to urge Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) to explain the (politician’s) appointment and terminate it altogether,” he said in a statement
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I also want to question how the individual managed to go through the relevant checks to be a member of the DBKL board

                I hope DBKL can reveal if there are any other appointees or staff who are insolvent yet still serving in DBKL.” Lim still managed to take a swipe at MIC, asking why the Barisan Nasional component party did not similarly raise its voice over the 1MDB scandal involving former prime minister Najib Razak

                He said the “personal liberty” stated in Article 5(1) was not an absolute right, but a right that could be regulated, such as the right to own drugs or firearms
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The article protects individuals from executive arbitrariness, but Shad said personal liberty could be deprived if this was done according to law
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As long as there is a valid law and the executive acts in accordance with the law, there is no unconstitutional violation of personal liberty,” he told FMT

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As for subjecting the generation born in 2007 and later to the Tobacco and Smoking Control Bill, Shad said this was “rational and reasonable” according to the law
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As age is not a protected category, Bar Council official Andrew Khoo said it could be argued that concerns about discrimination under the bill were unwarranted
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The government could argue that there is no discrimination under this bill since members of the generation affected by the GEG will be treated similarly among themselves,” the co-chairman of the Bar Council constitutional law committee said

                James Chin of the University of Tasmania and the Umno Supreme Council member, who declined to be named, said these rumours should not be taken too seriously as the focus at the federal level is on the next general election (GE15)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Chin believed that Rauf was dissatisfied because he had expected to become the chief minister after the landslide win in the Melaka state elections last year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “These rumours are just part of an ongoing feud among some unhappy members of Umno,” he told FMT
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Small issues at the state level are just a sideshow,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last week, Rauf denied allegations that the 21 Umno assemblymen had any issue with Sulaiman’s leadership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked if Rauf posed a threat to Sulaiman’s leadership, Fauzi said it depended on whether Rauf wanted Umno assemblymen who were backing him to shift their loyalty away from the chief minister

                Does MCA have a money tree in their garden producing money? Or as Bersatu Youth chief Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal once said, you can print more money

                MCA is part of the federal government and if it is sincere about affordable housing and other issues, it should make its proposal there and ensure that these are implemented nationwide, not just in Selangor

                Malaysian Trades Union Congress president Effendy Ghani said EPF should give workers until the end of the year to decide whether they want to go back to the old rate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The purpose of reducing the rate in the first place was to put more money in people’s hands,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Effendy said allowing employees to retain the 9% contribution rate till year-end would give them time to revise their financial plans
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To prevent abuse, he suggested that employees who wanted to retain their 9% contribution rate be required to apply for it
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the concerns of economists that a reduction in the contribution rate would affect the contributors later in life, Effendy pointed out that private sector employees typically received annual pay increases

                The move, he added, resulted in an oversupply of chicken and caused the price to drop below the ceiling price set by the government

                In order to be competitive, the price of chicken from Malaysia should be affordable compared to the supply of frozen chicken that Singapore currently imports from Indonesia and Thailand

                India fulfils two-thirds of its vegetable oil demand through imports of around 14 million tonnes annually, including around 8.5 million tonnes of palm oil

                Even if Telangana manages to grow oil palm on only 1 million acres and produces 2 million tonnes of palm oil, it would be a huge achievement, said Chava Venkateswara Rao of Godrej Agrovet Ltd GODE.NS, the country's biggest palm oil producer

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Until last year, the country was adding around 35,000 acres under oil palm every year

                Now, with the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project, we have ample water for oil palm," said farmer Bollampalli Venkateshwar Rao, who planted oil palms on 12 acres

                Ravi Mathur, who heads the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research (IIOPR), a government-backed body spearheading the oil palm push, said the lift irrigation project has made oil palm planting feasible in areas previously unsuitable for the crop because of water scarcity

                To overcome the weaknesses raised and to ensure the mistakes are not repeated in the future, the auditor-general proposed that the transport ministry review all the contract terms to ensure that the interests of the government are protected

                Chan also called on Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) president Datuk Seri Maximus Ongkili to reveal the police report that he said was made earlier in January

                The lawmaker also added that Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor, who is the chairman of the ruling Gabungan Rakyat Sabah there, previously made a promise to look into the matter, but has not given the public any updates on the investigation
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                In January, activist groups in Sabah questioned the identity of Sabah MIC chief Peer Mohamad Kadir, who allegedly shares the same name as an individual from India who entered the state in 1984, and was a witness in the Royal Commission of Inquiry (RCI) on illegal immigration in Sabah in 2013
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The individual, who was the 116th witness in the RCI, confessed to obtaining a Malaysian identity card through dubious means allegedly with the help of an uncle, after coming to Sabah in 1984 from Chennai, India
            </p>

                Asbi Munip, 32, said this was because the money laundering case investigation was focused on the transfer of RM100,000 from Syed Saddiq’s personal Maybank account to his Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) account
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked by Gobind if the witness knew Syed Saddiq’s source of income before becoming a minister, Asbi answered that he knew Syed Saddiq had been a part-time tutor at the International Islamic Universiti Malaysia (IIUM)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The 29th prosecution witness then agreed with the lawyer that he did not investigate Syed Saddiq’s source of income before he became a minister while investigating the money laundering case

                He was responding to a question by Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh, who wanted to know whether investigation papers had been opened against Mustapa, deputy law minister Mas Ermieyati Samsuddin and deputy health minister Dr Noor Azmi Ghazali following reports lodged with MACC on alleged misappropriation of funds or party allocations worth tens of millions of ringgit

                Zahid claimed that the Jeli MP, who was also the Kelantan Umno chief, had taken more than RM30 million that was supposed to be used to bring home Kelantan residents from the Klang Valley to vote in the state

                “As such, the government is currently studying various future-proof health financing options to strengthen the country’s health care system as a whole so that health services are more equitable, have high standards, easily accessible at a reasonable cost, and are sustainable in the long run

                Dr Mahathir added that if there was no evidence to support the claim, he considered Apandi's statement libellous and that he had the right to take legal action
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former prime minister was responding to four questions posed by Apandi on Facebook last month, including on the Batu Puteh case, the Sulu claim, and his dismissal suit as AG
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Apandi's actions also showed negligence in claiming that Najib was innocent
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the question of why he unilaterally withdrew Malaysia’s bid to overturn the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) 2008 ruling on Batu Puteh, Dr Mahathir said it was in respect of an earlier agreement with Singapore
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "If Malaysia had not dropped the claim, Indonesia would also have grounds to claim both the Sipadan and Ligitan islands off Sabah," he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "New facts on Batu Puteh, if present, should also be presented to the international courts when making a representation that Batu Puteh indeed belonged to Malaysia," he said.
