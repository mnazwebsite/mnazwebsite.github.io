                “This law should be implemented immediately to show transparency and accountability in political governance.” He said that a memorandum on the bill was expected to be presented to the Cabinet in September for approval prior to the next Parliament sitting in October

                According to Wan Junaidi, they discussed the establishment of a regulating entity for political funding, the types of funding allowed, and the penalties for offences under the proposed bill

                "Is Malaysia’s stronger than expected 2022 second-quarter growth of 8.9 per cent due to the extraordinary increase in private sector consumption and investment of 18.3 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively following the one-off Employees Provident Fund (EPF) special withdrawals of RM10,000 disbursed in April 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, Malaysia was announced to have recorded a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2022 when compared to the same quarter in 2021
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim noted that private sector consumption in Malaysia only grew by 5.5 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022, in contrast to the 18.9 per cent year-on-year growth in the second quarter of 2022
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "If the RM44 billion from the RM10,000 one-off special EPF withdrawal did not generate the 18.3 per cent jump in private sector consumption for the second quarter, Bank Negara should determine the source of the increase

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim said there was concern about whether Malaysia's second-quarter economic growth is too reliant on firm domestic demand, particularly the RM44 billion one-off special EPF withdrawals
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Since there will be no more RM44 billion one-off EPF special withdrawals in the pipeline, Malaysia’s economic growth will depend on external demand, which is subject to slower global growth," he said

                John reportedly said Sabah PKR members were hoping for Anwar to resolve the problem of the existence of two camps there — one which was aligned with then Sabah PKR chief Christina Liew, and another one aligned with PKR Keningau division chief Datuk Sangkar Rasam and the latter's nephew and former Sabah PKR youth chief and current Pensiangan PKR division chief Raymond Ahuar
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Anwar on August 6 announced that Sangkar would replace Liew as Sabah PKR chief
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                John reportedly said he was not questioning the decision to change the Sabah PKR chief as it was the PKR president's prerogative to do so, but said this was the "wrong timing" and that the party's focus should instead be on the 15th general election (GE15) which he said was just around the corner
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                These were the only two seats that PKR had won in Sabah in the general elections in 2018, with Liew winning the Tawau seat then
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Liew is currently also the Api-Api state assemblyman and was formerly deputy chief minister of Sabah, and had been a PKR member for the past 20 years and had been the Sabah PKR chief since October 2016

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to The Star, Sangkar had last December led 16 Sabah PKR division chiefs in calling for Anwar to drop Liew as Sabah PKR chief

                Sociopolitical analyst Awang Azman Pawi noted that the LCS scandal was being used as a “political weapon” with opposition parties PKR, Amanah and DAP attacking Umno leaders over the issue
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Political analyst James Chin of the University of Tasmania’s Asia Institute said he was sure PH were hoping to capitalise on the LCS controversy  “The opposition is thinking… ‘If we can manage to make the LCS scandal as big as 1MDB, then maybe we can follow the same tactic to get rid of BN’,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “So that’s why everyone is playing up the LCS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The scandal led to BN losing power over the federal government for the first time

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Although the opposition has cast Umno leaders as the villains in the controversy, Awang Azman said PH could have handled the issue better when it was in government (from 2018 to 2020) by forming a royal commission of inquiry or pushing for investigations by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Karl Andersson from the University of Manchester spent three months researching how readers “experience sexual pleasure” when reading Japanese shota comics
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I had hit a wall in my research,” Anderson wrote in the abstract of his 4,000-word article published in the journal Qualitative Research
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “And so I realised that my body was equipped with a research tool of its own that could give me, quite literally, a first-hand understanding of shota.” Andersson, who is originally from Sweden, also concluded that masturbation could be an act of “self-care”, and that the activity was when “we are least alone”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Thinking more critically about my own masturbation also made me wonder if all sex is masturbation, in the sense that people are focused on their own pleasure and use other people as ‘masturbation material’,” he wrote
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While the paper was originally published online in April, it went viral on Twitter earlier this week, sparking debate about research ethics and values
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Many questioned the ethics of the paper, saying it was bordering on paedophilia due to the nature of shota comics

                China launched ballistic missiles and deployed multiple aircraft and warships around Taiwan in recent days, angered by last week’s visit to the island by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi

                The Chinese embassy in New Delhi said last week that India was one of the first countries to recognise Beijing’s ‘one China principle’ – that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China – and that it hoped India would not change its position
