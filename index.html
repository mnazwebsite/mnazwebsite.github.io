                Kepong MP Lim Lip Eng praised MIC for pushing for answers over the matter, despite how it allegedly involved a member of Bersatu, a party MIC is working with in the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I stand with MIC to urge Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) to explain the (politician’s) appointment and terminate it altogether,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I also want to question how the individual managed to go through the relevant checks to be a member of the DBKL board
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                I hope DBKL can reveal if there are any other appointees or staff who are insolvent yet still serving in DBKL.” Lim still managed to take a swipe at MIC, asking why the Barisan Nasional component party did not similarly raise its voice over the 1MDB scandal involving former prime minister Najib Razak

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At a press conference, PAC chairman Wong Kah Woh said the initial Sigma model ships chosen by the navy were approved by the defence ministry
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The others summoned included current defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein, defence ministry secretary-general Muez Abd Aziz, former auditor-general Ambrin Buang, current navy chief Mohd Reza Sany and BNS’ CEO and chief operating officer
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong pointed out that not a single ship had been completed although RM6 billion had been spent by Putrajaya over the project given to BNS via direct negotiations
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said the PAC found that the government had failed in its duty to carry out due diligence on BNS’ financial problems
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong said BNS’ payments to the government were not entirely used for the LCS project, resulting in a cost overrun of RM1.4 billion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong also suggested that the defence ministry be required to present a progress report to the PAC on the LCS project every three months until its completion, while substantive procurement planning is periodically presented to a special select committee

                To further improve the WiFi experience at home, customers must take a few steps, including shifting the router to a part of the house where most of the time is spent

                To optimise the WiFi experience, Lolita said that Unifi now offers a variety of mesh add-ons, based on customers' lifestyle needs, the number of devices used and the size of the home

                “PSD takes this matter seriously and would like to emphasise that all charges against the director-general are baseless and maliciously intended to tarnish his image as a high government official,” PSD said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 4)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                PSD explained that its director-general had reprimanded an Immigration officer at KLIA for non-compliance with practices and procedures where officials did not check the travel documents and passports of the director-general and his delegation abroad

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “He recommended that the Immigration Department at KLIA should improve compliance with standard operating procedures to avoid any non-compliance with immigration rules,” it said

                The KLIA Immigration Operations head was said to have been at the receiving end because there were no Immigration officers stationed at the VIP room between 8.40am and 9.40am on Wednesday

                JPA said Shafiq had rightly reprimanded the immigration officer, James Lee, over non-compliance with procedures after he failed to check the director-general and his delegation’s travel documents and passports

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Does MCA have a money tree in their garden producing money? Or as Bersatu Youth chief Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal once said, you can print more money

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                MCA is part of the federal government and if it is sincere about affordable housing and other issues, it should make its proposal there and ensure that these are implemented nationwide, not just in Selangor

                This comes in the wake of the announcement that the retirement fund had reverted the statutory contribution rate to 11% from July, from the 9% it was reduced to last year to boost disposable income during the pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysian Trades Union Congress president Effendy Ghani said EPF should give workers until the end of the year to decide whether they want to go back to the old rate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The purpose of reducing the rate in the first place was to put more money in people’s hands,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Effendy said allowing employees to retain the 9% contribution rate till year-end would give them time to revise their financial plans
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To prevent abuse, he suggested that employees who wanted to retain their 9% contribution rate be required to apply for it
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the concerns of economists that a reduction in the contribution rate would affect the contributors later in life, Effendy pointed out that private sector employees typically received annual pay increases

                Yesterday, Chong confirmed that Gobi Krishnan had been removed from all positions in the party with immediate effect

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This was after the wing discovered that Gobi Krishnan had been declared bankrupt on Jan 7 last year

                DAP central executive committee member Sheikh Umar Bagharib Ali said clarity was needed in the issue following several replies in Parliament regarding Oktoberfest

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the issue stemmed from a parliamentary reply from Deputy National Unity Minister Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal who defended Religious Affairs Minister Datuk Idris Ahmad’s personal view that both Bon Odori and Oktoberfest should not be allowed

                However, the report said the programme, aimed at improving the quality of life for B40 households living in the city, had reached the targeted number of participants

                About Us Advertise BALING, Aug 3 — The Musang King durian farm project in Gunung Inas here was not the cause of the debris flow tragedy on July 4 in Baling district that claimed three lives, said Kedah Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said none of the reservoirs on the project had burst as claimed by certain parties
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When asked to make comment on the statement by Minister of Environment and Water, Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man in a previous media report that said the flood was caused by a burst reservoir that on the durian farm project, he said the minister’s statement actually mentioned the “possibility” of this occurrence and it was not based on accurate facts
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Meanwhile, commenting on the flood incident that happened in several villages in Mukim Baling yesterday which was allegedly caused by the flow of water from Gunung Inas, Muhammad Sanusi said the cause of the flood incident has not yet been ascertained yet
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In another development, he said the Musang King durian farm project in the Rimba Teloi Permanent Forest Reserve (HSK), Sik will continue even though there is a possible risk of unwanted incidents in the area

                Dr Mahathir added that if there was no evidence to support the claim, he considered Apandi's statement libellous and that he had the right to take legal action
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former prime minister was responding to four questions posed by Apandi on Facebook last month, including on the Batu Puteh case, the Sulu claim, and his dismissal suit as AG
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Apandi's actions also showed negligence in claiming that Najib was innocent

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the question of why he unilaterally withdrew Malaysia’s bid to overturn the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) 2008 ruling on Batu Puteh, Dr Mahathir said it was in respect of an earlier agreement with Singapore
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Asbi Munip, 32, said this was because the money laundering case investigation was focused on the transfer of RM100,000 from Syed Saddiq’s personal Maybank account to his Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) account

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked by Gobind if the witness knew Syed Saddiq’s source of income before becoming a minister, Asbi answered that he knew Syed Saddiq had been a part-time tutor at the International Islamic Universiti Malaysia (IIUM)

                The 29th prosecution witness then agreed with the lawyer that he did not investigate Syed Saddiq’s source of income before he became a minister while investigating the money laundering case

                This follows a landmark Federal Court ruling today which found that the state constitution banning party hopping was in line with the Federal Constitution

                The four Penang assemblymen are Dr Afif Bahardin (Seberang Jaya, ex-PKR), Zulkifli Ibrahim (Sg Acheh, ex-PKR), Khaliq Mehtab Mohd Ishaq (Bertam, Bersatu but pro-PN), and Zolkifly Md Lazim (Telok Bahang, Bersatu but pro-PN)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The four Penang assemblymen had previously filed an injunction against the Penang legislature from passing a motion to vacate their seats after they decided to support PN

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that Kelantan’s state law barring party hopping was illegal as it violated Article 10(1)(c) of the Federal Constitution on freedom of association

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The first booster shot will be administered at least three months after the third dose

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As for children aged between five and 11 years old who were moderately or severely immunocompromised, they will also be given a third dose vaccine at an interval of at least eight weeks after the second dose
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Dr Noor Azmi said this in response to The Star's request for clarification on whether or not the second booster will be administered to all teenagers

                He was responding to a question by Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh, who wanted to know whether investigation papers had been opened against Mustapa, deputy law minister Mas Ermieyati Samsuddin and deputy health minister Dr Noor Azmi Ghazali following reports lodged with MACC on alleged misappropriation of funds or party allocations worth tens of millions of ringgit

                Zahid claimed that the Jeli MP, who was also the Kelantan Umno chief, had taken more than RM30 million that was supposed to be used to bring home Kelantan residents from the Klang Valley to vote in the state

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                He also said the Masjid Tanah MP had been entrusted with funds to manage Puteri Umno in GE14, but claimed it was transferred to another account for her personal use

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gobind said Syed Saddiq had raised “various defences” to justify a transfer of RM100,000 into his Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) account as well as a RM120,000 deposit into his bank account when the authorities recorded his statements in 2020

                In reply, Asbi said his investigation focused on the transfer of RM100,000 from Syed Saddiq’s Maybank account to his ASB account between June 16 and June 19, 2018

                But Taiwan rejects China’s sovereignty claims and says only its people can decide the island’s future

                Hashtags related to Pelosi’s visit, such as “the resolve to realise national reunification is rock solid”, went viral on China’s Weibo microblogging platform

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Some bloggers even regarded Pelosi’s temerity as justification for an immediate invasion of Taiwan, with many users posting the term “there is only one China”

                Without mentioning events in Taiwan, Weibo said today the platform crashed because its broadband capacity was overstretched

                Chan also called on Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) president Datuk Seri Maximus Ongkili to reveal the police report that he said was made earlier in January

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The lawmaker also added that Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor, who is the chairman of the ruling Gabungan Rakyat Sabah there, previously made a promise to look into the matter, but has not given the public any updates on the investigation
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                "Peer himself did not issue any statement distancing himself from the RCI and still roams free in Sabah," he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In January, activist groups in Sabah questioned the identity of Sabah MIC chief Peer Mohamad Kadir, who allegedly shares the same name as an individual from India who entered the state in 1984, and was a witness in the Royal Commission of Inquiry (RCI) on illegal immigration in Sabah in 2013

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The individual, who was the 116th witness in the RCI, confessed to obtaining a Malaysian identity card through dubious means allegedly with the help of an uncle, after coming to Sabah in 1984 from Chennai, India

                He also said former transport minister Loke Siew Fook, who is now the DAP secretary-general, was the one who proposed the reimbursement of RM555 million to the armed forces pension fund (LTAT), which it spent to take over the concession of the Automatic Enforcement System (AES) for driving offences as per a 2014 government directive

                In a statement today, he alleged Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as among leaders who made such remarks when the latter labelled the "Pakatan Harapan government as being a DAP government", as well as twisting facts and numbers on DAP, when it was in government under PH

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail Sabri reportedly said the move "unconstitutionally and undemocratically toppled the elected Pakatan Harapan government" after 22 months, on the grounds of DAP's dominance in the PH government

                Beyond Borders and the Alliance of Chin Refugees cited the case of a Myanmar refugee who took his own life after throwing three of his children from the Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR2) highway yesterday morning

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The NGOs urged Putrajaya to put an end to immigration raids and to give refugees the right to work in Malaysia, to ease the pressure the community was facing
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They also called for aid packages to include the community and for UNHCR to be given access to immigration detention centres so that refugees there can be registered

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Even having a UNHCR card doesn’t guarantee they won’t get arrested by the police or immigration,” they said in a joint statement

                “Not only do they not have the right to work, they are also unable to access affordable healthcare and structured education for their children.” The NGOs said that under international laws and humanitarian principles, Putrajaya was obligated to guarantee the rights of refugees and asylum-seekers

                Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles was quoted by the Philippine News Agency as saying that the proprietary claim by the heirs was "in the nature of a private claim"

                Marcos Jr's recent statement about the country's territory, Cruz-Angeles explained, also still needs to be clarified

                “The President’s articulation of his statement about not giving up a square inch of territory will have to be reduced into writing and into specifics, after which, we will announce these to you if they are in any way related to the Sabah claim," she said

                However, without knowing the decision of the Madrid Court to cancel Stampa's appointment as an arbitrator, a French arbitration court went ahead with the Sulu descendants' case against Malaysia last September

                On Feb 28 this year, the Paris Arbitration Court awarded the Sulu heirs US$14.92bil (RM66.4bil) from Malaysia

                It followed a U.N.-brokered grain and fertiliser export agreement between Moscow and Kyiv last month - a rare diplomatic breakthrough in a drawn-out war of attrition

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                in partnership with Turkey, we had a first ship with the delivery of grain, but it’s still nothing

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Ukraine, one of the world's top grain producers before the war, had to export a minimum 10 million tonnes of grain to urgently help bring down its budget deficit which was running at $5 billion a month
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the grain shipment but also said it was "only a first step"

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the grain deal might offer a way forward out of conflict

            <p> </p>

                "A first success is the grain deal, perhaps that can be slowly expanded to a ceasefire." Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had also told Schroeder that, in theory, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was ready to be used to help increase gas supplies to Europe

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 – Malaysia’s public health care system, which charges RM1 and RM5 for outpatient and specialist care respectively in Ministry of Health (MOH) facilities, is unsustainable, Khairy Jamaluddin said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The government is aware that the existing public health financing model is not sustainable and will put additional pressure on the federal expenditure
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As such, the government is currently studying various future-proof health financing options to strengthen the country’s health care system as a whole so that health services are more equitable, have high standards, easily accessible at a reasonable cost, and are sustainable in the long run
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairy said the government will use a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to ensure that the people’s health interests are protected in the implementation of any health financing system in the future

                India fulfils two-thirds of its vegetable oil demand through imports of around 14 million tonnes annually, including around 8.5 million tonnes of palm oil

                Even if Telangana manages to grow oil palm on only 1 million acres and produces 2 million tonnes of palm oil, it would be a huge achievement, said Chava Venkateswara Rao of Godrej Agrovet Ltd GODE.NS, the country's biggest palm oil producer

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Until last year, the country was adding around 35,000 acres under oil palm every year

                Now, with the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project, we have ample water for oil palm," said farmer Bollampalli Venkateshwar Rao, who planted oil palms on 12 acres

                Ravi Mathur, who heads the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research (IIOPR), a government-backed body spearheading the oil palm push, said the lift irrigation project has made oil palm planting feasible in areas previously unsuitable for the crop because of water scarcity

                With the rate being restored to 11% after having been cut to 9% in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Universiti Putra Malaysia’s (UPM) Rusmawati Said cautioned that if employees are unable to save now, it would get complicated when they were older

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last year, the employee’s share of the statutory contribution rate to EPF was reduced to 9% to boost disposable income during the pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In July, it was set back to 11%
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rusmawati said an individual earning RM2,000 a month would contribute RM220 based on the current rate

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “When employees retire, they will have savings that would allow them to get by.” Barjoyai also said employees should not look at the amount deducted for such contributions as a loss as the sum would eventually “return” with interest
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “EPF isn’t a tax but a long-term saving scheme,” he said, adding that this was the best time to revert to the 11% rate to ensure that retirement plans would not be disrupted

                Political analyst Anantha Raman Govindasamy of Universiti Malaysia Sabah told FMT he believed Umno made a top-down rather than a grassroots decision in appointing Tengku Zafrul to the Selangor post
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                So we just need to wait and see how Umno tries to repackage him, rebuild his image and sell him to the grassroots

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I think he will be repackaged in such a way that he will be seen as one of the clear candidates to help Umno take over Selangor

                Sheikh Moqhtar Kadir said the PJD Link was merely a rebranding of the Kinrara Damansara Expressway (Kidex) that was cancelled in 2015 and removed from the Selangor State Structural Plan 2035 by the state government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Based on this, why did the ministry not exclude PJD Link from the Malaysia Highway Authority’s Highway Network Development Plan (HNDP) 2030?” said Moqhtar, the chairman of the Coalition Against PJD Link Highway, in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “How was PJD Link given its approval in principle when Kidex was to be removed from the Selangor State Structural Plan 2035?” He noted that menteri besar Amirudin Shari had “confirmed (Kidex’s) rebranding” at a PKR political bureau meeting last September
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Moqhtar said the coalition was seeking Fadillah’s consideration to review the validity of the PJD Link’s concession agreement since the minister had acknowledged the cancellation of Kidex in Parliament in 2016
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                His statement comes a day after Fadillah met with representatives of “Say No To PJD Link”, a group of Selangor residents against the planned highway, to assure them that the project would have to get the state government’s nod, and approval by the works ministry, before going ahead
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The project was approved in principle by the Cabinet on Nov 12, 2017, and by the Selangor government on Sept 3, 2020

                It’s not practical when you consider that construction costs have gone up and developers are having a hard time meeting the demand for affordable housing.” Juwairiya was commenting on Selangor MCA chief Ng Chok Sin’s remarks that the price of affordable homes in Selangor should be reduced by half if BN wrests control of the state in GE15

                On March 24, Judicial Commissioner Datuk Mohd Arief Emran Arifin ordered the Pekan Member of Parliament to disclose to SRC’s lawyers in writing his assets in or outside Malaysia, up to the value of RM42 million within 30 days after the order has been served on Najib

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mohd Arief Emran directed that Najib must not remove, dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of any of the assets in and outside Malaysia up to the value of RM42 million, pending the final determination of the suit

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib also disclosed that he had a total of RM1.24 million in an Affin Bank account and a deposit of RM2.52 million with Amanah Saham Nasional Berhad
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Through the affidavit filed on April 25, Najib confirmed that he did not have assets amounting to RM42 million

                On July 28, 2020, the High Court sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined RM210 million after he was found guilty of misappropriating RM42 million belonging to SRC

                Penang mufti, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Salim Wan Mohd Noor said it proved that coming from different ethnic and religious backgrounds was not an obstacle to establishing a good and cordial relationship between individuals

                Wan Salim said Islam indeed enjoined such a relationship even between parents and children professing different religions, as the family relationship must remain and not severed in any situation
