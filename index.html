                Secretary of the police force, Noorsiah Saaduddin, said a total of 238 Malaysians had been victims of the job scams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of that number, 70 had been rescued by the police

            <p>
                After getting the victim’s consent, the agent informs them that it will manage and bear the cost of travel to the job destination,” she said in a statement today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noorsiah said upon arrival at the destination, all travel documents and the victim’s phone will be confiscated and eliminated
            </p>
            
            <p>

                After failing to get more time to handle his appeal the court heard today that Najib would discharge Zaid's firm from his case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib explained that he opted to discharge Muhammad Shafee and his team after losing both his case and his appeal at the High Court and the Court of Appeal respectively

                August 15 and 16 were spent hearing Najib’s bid to add new evidence and seek a postponement that was ultimately disallowed by the Federal Court

                Judge Nazlan Ghazali, who read the broad grounds, said the three-member bench found that High Court judge Firuz Jaffril was correct to dismiss their suit last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In August last year, Firuz had granted a declaration to Jamaluddin’s mother, Aminah Abdullah, that the three million shares worth RM1.044 billion in Rantai Wawasan Sdn Bhd were part of her son’s estate, to which she was entitled to as a beneficiary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We, therefore, affirm the decision of the High Court and dismiss the defendants’ appeal,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The appellate court also dismissed Aminah’s appeal that shares worth RM313 million in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd should revert to her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As such, we also affirm the decision of the High Court which had refused a declaration sought by Aminah that the shares in both companies are part of the estate of Jamaluddin,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah is also embroiled in a civil suit in the Kuala Lumpur Shariah High Court over her share of RM1 billion from her daughter-in-law, Kalsom Ismail

                PH Youth said Ismail’s action is tantamount to abuse of power
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Any attempt to use civil servants to defend the government must be strongly rejected,” it said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Civil servants should adhere to the principle of neutrality in ensuring that the delivery of government services is not affected, even if there is any change in leadership.” The statement was signed by PH and DAP Youth chief Dr Kelvin Yii, PKR Youth chief Adam Adli, Amanah Youth chief Hasbie Muda and Upko Youth chief Felix Joseph Saang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former PH government also introduced regulations to prohibit top civil servants, as well as those in managerial and professional roles, from being involved in politics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During a meeting with staff of the Prime Minister’s Department on Tuesday, Ismail said it would be apt for civil servants to defend the government against allegations that the government under his administration had failed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On allegations that the police were linked to a network of fake social media accounts and pages that tried to boost support for the government and run down the opposition, PH Youth said Ismail’s message to the public servants only served to add credence to such claims

                “Can Zahid explain his silence on his primary role in the RM9 billion LCS scandal, which had exposed his earlier constant denials that he was to be blamed for the RM9 billion LCS scandal as lies?” he asked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The JKSTUPKK report disclosed that Zahid, as defence minister in 2011, had sided with the contractor, Boustead Naval Shipyard (BNS) instead of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN), the end-user for the six LCS ordered by the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim said Zahid owes the public an explanation on why he ignored the RMN’s recommendation for Sigma LCS and instead unilaterally chose to go with the Gowind LCS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim also asked the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission to explain why it has yet to charge anyone directly for the RM9 billion LCS scandal

            <p>
                He also took to task Defence Minister Datuk Hishamuddin Hussein for still keeping quiet about his ministry’s decision to halve the number of LCS that must be completed and delivered to the RMN by the contractor with no additional government funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When Hishammuddin appeared before the Public Accounts Committee on 25th January 2022, he spoke about ‘corporate restructuring’ of the RM9 billion LCS contract and that the contractor, BNS, will have to deliver two LCS without any new cost to the government

                Singapore High Commissioner Vanu Gopala Menon greeting guest-of-honour Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin at the reception in conjunction with the republic's National Day celebrated on Aug 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The island state's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon said the pandemic, however, has reinforced how interdependent Singapore and Malaysia have been throughout the challenging times
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "People make the relationship between our two countries truly special

            <p>
                Themed "We Missed You”, the reception was also attended by the Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin, who was the guest of honour
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In line with the theme, the venue was decorated with Singapore icons, that included part of Singapore’s national anthem - the words "Majulah”, which means "Onward”, carved in ice

                The Human Resources Minister said the scheme to cover homemakers against injuries suffered while tending to their chores would be managed by the Social Security Organisation (Socso)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 26, the Dewan Rakyat passed the Housewives Social Security Bill (HSS), which allows husbands to voluntarily contribute to the scheme for their wives below the age of 55
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if the definition of housewife would be widened to cover husbands who assume the role of homemakers as well, Saravanan said the ministry would need an in-depth study to see the number of house husbands involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No action would be taken against any husband who did not contribute.” However, he noted that husbands who have signed up to contribute and failed to maintain it monthly would be fined RM10,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saravanan also said the amendments passed in the Employment Insurance System Act 2017 (Act 800) and Employees’ Social Security Act 1969 (Act 4) to increase the maximum monthly salary ceiling limit from RM4,000 to RM5,000 would come into effect next month

                An apex court panel comprising Azahar Mohamed, Hasnah Mohammed Hashim and Abu Bakar Jais delivered the decision yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement, the SC said the decision reflected the seriousness of the breaches and reinforced the robustness of its audit oversight board’s (AOB) enforcement framework

            <p>
                In addition, AOB imposed fines of RM455,000 on the audit firm and RM88,000 each on Afrizan and Khairul
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the Federal Court decision, the stay on the AOB’s enforcement decisions until the disposal of the leave application to the apex court obtained by the audit firm and its partners at the Court of Appeal on Feb 11 has lapsed

                Masidi reportedly said there was no problem with the other oil and gas companies operating in Sabah as they had been paying the SST on time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that Sabah would be able to rake in RM1.2 billion annually if all of the firms had paid the SST on time

            <p>
                Masidi who is also state local government and housing minister reportedly said the issue was “being dealt with” by Sabah and Petronas, while the state government would pursue the matter within its legal power
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In July, Masidi told the state assembly that Sabah would cancel the work permits of the two firms if they failed to settle the RM97 million in SST owed to the state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the two companies were issued notices on the overdue SST on June 21, with the amount set to be settled within 30 days

                In calling for the charges to be dropped, the youth wing leaders of PH component parties said the charges were a waste of court resources and that such charges were meant to “intimidate the youth”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement was signed by DAP Youth chief Dr Kelvin Yii, PKR Youth chief Adam Adli Abd Halim, Amanah’s Hasbie Muda, and Upko Youth chief Felix Joseph Saang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier today, Hasbie, Batu PKR youth chief Sabda Suluh Lestari Yahya and student activist Aliff Naif Mohd Fizam, were charged with failing to notify the police five days before staging their gatherings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasbie’s charge was related to an event he had allegedly organised at Masjid Jamek, Kampung Baru on July 1, while Sabda’s charge concerned a protest in front of the Sogo shopping complex on July 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aliff’s charge also involved a protest in front of Sogo on July 23

                In a statement this afternoon, he said that the report found that LCS subcontractors had paid €43.69 million, equivalent to RM210 million, based on invoices from a French firm

            <p>
                He said based on the French firm’s financial returns to the French authorities, only €3.53 million (around RM18 million) was collected during that period

                Rafizi said the French firm was appointed to the LCS project’s subcontractor as a spare part supplier following recommendations by another French company

            <p>
                RECENTLY, it has been said that a lawyer climbed across balconies into an adjacent unit to record a video of a neighbour bathing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As their toilets were next to each other, Yeo could tell when the victim was in the shower by listening for her voice or the sound of videos playing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the evening of Nov 23, 2020, he deduced that she was bathing and climbed over the parapet and into her balcony to film her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He held his phone outside the shower window but the victim caught a glimpse of the phone before he could start recording
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He later deleted the video
