                “If this continues and the government intends to break the spirit of the youth, the future of the younger generation is in jeopardy and the fate of Malaysia is very dark,” he said in a statement

            <p>
                On Thursday, Amanah’s Hasbie Muda, Batu PKR youth chief Sabda Suluh Lestari Yahya and student activist Aliff Naif Mohd Fizam, were charged with failing to notify the police five days before staging their gatherings in protest of recent issues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If the freedom of expression by the youth continues to be suppressed and they continue to be dragged to court, there will be no future for them,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasbie’s charge was related to an event he had allegedly organised at Masjid Jamek, Kampung Baru on July 1, while Sabda’s charge concerned a protest in front of the Sogo shopping complex on July 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aliff’s charge also involved a protest against the rise in the price of goods, held in front of Sogo on July 23

            <p>
                Pakatan Harapan (PH) Youth later slammed the authorities for charging the three, claiming it was “politically motivated” and intended to “intimidate the youth”

                “If this continues and the government intends to break the spirit of the youth, the future of the younger generation is in jeopardy and the fate of Malaysia is very dark,” he said in a statement
            </p>

                On Thursday, Amanah’s Hasbie Muda, Batu PKR youth chief Sabda Suluh Lestari Yahya and student activist Aliff Naif Mohd Fizam, were charged with failing to notify the police five days before staging their gatherings in protest of recent issues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If the freedom of expression by the youth continues to be suppressed and they continue to be dragged to court, there will be no future for them,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hasbie’s charge was related to an event he had allegedly organised at Masjid Jamek, Kampung Baru on July 1, while Sabda’s charge concerned a protest in front of the Sogo shopping complex on July 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aliff’s charge also involved a protest against the rise in the price of goods, held in front of Sogo on July 23
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pakatan Harapan (PH) Youth later slammed the authorities for charging the three, claiming it was “politically motivated” and intended to “intimidate the youth”

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 20 — Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob was an unexpected choice to succeed Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, but political observers believe his appointment as Malaysia’s ninth prime minister last year is keeping the nation moving forward through economic and political crises both at home and globally

            <p>
                Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia political analyst Kartini Aboo Talib commended Ismail Sabri for enlarging his “Keluarga Malaysia” concept to “Keluarga Global” as instrumental for political stability within Asean during the Covid-19 era

                Incidental nation-builder Universiti Sains Malaysia’s political scientist Ahmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid said that Ismail Sabri’s ability to weather the storm shaking Malaysia’s political stability might have helped the 62-year-old increase his support among Malaysians

                Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, an associate director with Vriens & Partners — a public policy, government affairs and political risk consultancy — said Ismail Sabri’s biggest contribution in his first year as PM was showing he has political will to push through institutional and health reforms

                Ravinthran, and Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, also affirmed the decision of the High Court that disallowed Aminah Abdullah’s application for a declaration that six million shares in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd were also part of her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision in an online proceeding yesterday, dismissed the appeal brought by Jamaluddin’s children – Ikhwan Hafiz and Nur Anis – and the cross-appeal by Aminah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah was appealing against the High Court’s dismissal of her application to include the Alpine Motion and Ivory Insights shares as part of her son’s estate, while her grandchildren were appealing against the High Court’s ruling to put the Rantai Wawasan shares in the list of their father’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan said the Rantai Wawasan shares should be included in Jamaluddin’s estate as the trust deed which was created in 2009 when Jamaluddin was alive was valid and that the trust deed created in 2015 by Jamaluddin’s children after his (Jamaluddin’s) demise was null and void
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah is seeking to include the three million Rantai Wawasan shares worth RM1.44bil, six million Alpine Motion shares worth RM233mil and two Ivory Insights shares worth RM80mil in her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her statement of claim, Aminah claimed that her grandchildren failed to enter the shares of the three companies – Rantai Wawasan, Alpine Motion and Ivory Insight – as part of the deceased’s estate with the intention of denying her rights and interests as a beneficiary
