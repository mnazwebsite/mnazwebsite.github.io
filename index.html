                Stressing that such regulations only serve to “constrict and strangle” Orang Asli communities, the lawyer was adamant that the Orang Asli should have the right to harvest forest produce for commercial purposes as they have been doing so with minimal impact to the land for “thousands of years”
            </p>

                They have been there before forest reserves were even created

                “He is an Orang Asal

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Just because some Orang Asli who live in the forest and its fringes use its resources doesn’t mean the forest reserves will be degraded
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                It’s not about non-use of forest resources, it’s about wise use of forest resources.” Nicholas said the forest produce that Orang Asli communities harvested for sale included rattan, bamboo, resin and fish

                Department director-general Datuk Seri Khairul Dzaimee Daud said he would reserve comment for now since a special committee has been tasked with conducting a probe into the matter

                “What I can say is that we will fully cooperate with the committee in its probe,” he told reporters after an engagement session with tour agencies at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) yesterday

                During the incident on Aug 3, the Immigration operations head at KLIA was said to be at the receiving end of the rebuke when apparently no Immigration officers were stationed at the VIP lane between 8.40am and 9.40am

                North Johor Bahru police chief Rupiah Abd Wahid said the baby’s mother had made a police report two days ago about the video clip that was widely shared, Berita Harian reported
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She said that the mother told police she and her daughter were at the restaurant with her sister and a man believed to be her sister’s friend
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The suspect held the baby and suddenly placed a non-functioning vape device in the baby’s mouth as a joke,” Rupiah was quoted as saying

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The act was recorded by her sister who then uploaded it on social media, which went viral and drew public backlash.” Following the report, police arrested a 23-year-old man today

                The age of eligibility for the licence would be lowered from 21 years to 18 when the new rules come into force, to allow more people to become delivery riders, transport minister Wee Ka Siong said today
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said delivery riders with the goods licence would be given driving courses “because there are complaints that they do not abide by traffic laws”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wee said the requirement of a goods licence would allow the authorities to keep track of their number, and “know who are those working in the p-hailing service and their behaviour”, Bernama reported
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wee said the requirement for a goods licence was not meant to burden delivery riders but to enable the transport ministry to keep track of their numbers

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Friday, a group of about 200 delivery riders carried out a protest ride to the service company offices

                Posters with the words “Off 1 Hari” and “Food Delivery Blackout” had been widely shared on social media, calling for a boycott of the delivery service

                The LCS project calls for the construction of six corvette-class vessels for delivery between 2019 and this month

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein later said those involved in misconduct in the project would be brought to justice

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier today, PKR deputy president Rafizi Ramli had called out former prime minister Najib Razak, saying he could not wash his hands of the LCS deal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Najib was in office when the government signed the deal with Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) in 2011 and was the only person with the power to influence a change in the ship’s design from the navy’s original requirements
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A parliamentary committee said the navy and the defence ministry had agreed on a Dutch-design but the decision was changed to the French-designed Gowind ships after a recommendation by BNS to the defence minister
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Rafizi said this is because Najib, who was in office when the government signed the deal for the LCS project with Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) in 2011, was the only person with the power to influence a change in the ship’s design from the navy’s requirements

                DCNS, now known as the Naval Group, is a sub-contractor for the LCS project

                “That is why I have said that former prime minister Najib Razak cannot wash his hands of this scandal, calling on Najib to answer the questions raised,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Thursday, Public Accounts Committee chairman Wong Kah Woh said the defence ministry and BNS had ignored the navy’s views on the LCS project

                Khairul said investigations had shown that a group from India allegedly treated poorly at the terminal had not gone to the immigration counter directly and had been loitering in the arrival area for almost three hours

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the immigration officers went looking for them after officers noted that some passengers listed on the airline manifest had not turned up at the immigration counter even after two to three hours

                In another development, Khairul said the National Integrated Immigration System was expected to be operational in early 2024, to replace the Malaysian Immigration System which had been in operation for more than 20 years
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 8 — Education Minister Datuk Mohd Radzi Md Jidin today acknowledged that the Malaysian education system has been stagnant due to unwillingness to make changes, leaving other countries to surpass Malaysia in terms of education

                “If after 10 years we are not ready, how many decades will it take for us to be ready?,” he said in his speech at the Education Transformation Forum at Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral hotel here

                Dindings was one of the five feed millers which received the Malaysia Competition Commission’s (MyCC) proposed decision notice for infringing Section 4 of the Competition Act 2010 (Act 712) on Aug 5

                DPDC, which is a joint venture company of Malayan Flour Mills Bhd, said it intended to defend such unfounded allegations vigorously

                “DPDC will review the matter with its external legal counsel and submit written representations within the specified period and make an oral representation before MyCC,” Malayan Flour Mills said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today

                The other four feed millers which received the same proposed decision notice from MyCC are FFM Bhd, Gold Coin Feedmills (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, Leong Hup Feedmill Malaysia Sdn Bhd and PK Agro-Industrial Products (M) Sdn Bhd

                Gnanaraja was because he was threatened to be charged under the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) over his involvement in the controversial Penang undersea tunnel project

                Consortium Zenith Construction Sdn Bhd (CZCSB) director Datuk Zarul Ahmad Mohd Zulkifli, 52, said he received the threat from Gnanaraja through a WhatsApp message, which contained Zarul’s name and identification number
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The investigation against Gnanaraja began after I was released from MACC’s detention

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, Gobind and deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin got into a heated argument over the copy of Gnanaraja’s statement recorded by MACC during the investigation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gobind requested for the prosecution to confirm whether the WhatsApp messages between Zarul and Gnanaraja have been reduced to a statement, to which Wan Shaharuddin replied it was not the prosecution’s burden to assist the defence on such matters
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Loke said Wee’s decision demonstrated that an open tender for the project was not feasible despite the latter’s insistence on calling for a fresh tender in August 2020
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                “I want to tell both (Finance Minister Datuk Seri) Tengku Zafrul (Abdul Aziz) and Wee to ‘eat back their own words’

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The open tender did not proceed but the contract was renegotiated

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After the PH government collapsed in 2020 and was replaced by Perikatan Nasional, Wee took over as the transport minister and said the project would be reopened for tender, before mocking Loke for not choosing this “cheaper” option

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If we took this to court, for sure the government would have lost the case and we could have to pay compensation to the company and the project would have come to a halt

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During case management last month, the Federal Court dismissed Najib's new defence counsel's application to adjourn the hearing of the appeal, which was fixed for Aug 15 to 26
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As a result, the hearing of Najib's application to adduce further evidence with regard to then High Court trial judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali has been fixed to be heard first on Aug 15, followed by the hearing of the former premier's appeal to set aside his conviction and sentence
            </p>

                They took over the case from Shafee, who was removed on July 25

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib said he hopes that the appointment of the new defence team will bring a fresh or different perspective to the case as he is headed for the final appeal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction and sentence in Najib's appeal, and in a strongly-worded judgement described how SRC, which started off as a national interest venture, had in the end become a national embarrassment

                The matter in question in the suit is an allegation by Muhyiddin that Ahmad Zahid sought his help to intervene in certain court cases

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Justice Rozana Ali Yusoff said this in her dismissal of Ahmad Zahid's injunction application against Muhyiddin during an online proceeding here on Monday (Aug 8)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court dismissed the application with RM5,000 in costs

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In today's proceedings, the court heard the plaintiff's (Ahmad Zahid) application for an interim injunction against the defendant

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Bagan Datuk MP claimed that Muhyiddin’s statement implied that he had used a shortcut to settle and postpone his ongoing court cases, that he had asked for Muhyiddin’s help to intervene in the court cases and the judiciary system, to order the dissolution of the Johor State Assembly and also implied that he was not a respectable and exemplary leader

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Muhyiddin claimed that when he heard the plaintiff’s request, he told the latter that he could not and would not interfere with the court proceedings and advised the plaintiff to defend himself in court if he was truly innocent

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Defence lawyer Gobind Singh Deo had earlier questioned Zarul Ahmad on, among others, the purported conversation exchange he had with Gnanaraja between May 2017 and January 2018
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gnanaraja was named by Zarul Ahmad as one of the conmen
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When Gobind later asked if the criminal charges would have affected the firm had they materialised, Zarul Ahmad said yes
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Zarul Ahmad later disagreed with the defence that it was the only reason for him doing so but did not specify his other reasons
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gnanaraja — who was introduced to Zarul Ahmad by former minister Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz — has since been charged with cheating Zarul Ahmad and had his state award bearing the title "Datuk” revoked by the Pahang Palace in 2019

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For the second amended charge, Lim is alleged to have solicited from Zarul Ahmad 10 per cent of the profit to be gained by the company in appreciation of obtaining the project

                “The report did not include investigations involving the change of land use and the violation of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures and other laws,” he said in a statement

                While the Gunung Inas Forest Reserve was EIA-approved for forest development, he said, the durian trees planted in the area were not approved by the forestry department

                Referring to the “root cause” and “additional factors” stated in the report, he said it was clear that the use of the hilly area for the durian plantation was to blame for the floods

                “I would like to emphasise that the flood disaster in Baling was not a natural disaster, but a man-made disaster that disrespected the environment and the law,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Wong said the recommendations in the report could be implemented by the Kedah government, highlighting that it was important for the state to take drastic measures in recovering the logged area of the forest reserve

                “DAP has no objection if the government deems such a high-level committee as necessary to probe an alleged verbal abuse incident, but similar attention and importance should be placed on the LCS scandal when RM6 billion has been paid without a single ship delivered

                Earlier, PAC chairman Wong Kah Woh said the defence ministry and Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) had ignored the navy’s views on the LCS project over the design of the LCS

                Research published this year found that eight out of every 10 pupils tested at a rural Chinese primary school in Bentong suffered from vision problems, with about 60% of them being myopic (short-sighted) and 16% hyperopic (far-sighted)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Over the past month, some Bersatu leaders had been pressing Ismail to honour his promise to elect a deputy prime minister from the party, as was previously agreed when Bersatu decided to support Ismail’s appointment as prime minister
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Wasn’t there a promise with PH, in which Bersatu was a component, for Dr Mahathir Mohamad to be prime minister for two years, after which the position would be handed over to Anwar Ibrahim?” he said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “That was a clear breach of promise too.” Similarly, Hassan pointed to Hamzah’s collusion with Mahathir to organise the Malay Dignity Congress in 2019, calling it part of the efforts to derail Anwar’s promised premiership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the end, he said, it was Muhyiddin who became prime minister instead of Anwar
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “For them to now accuse Ismail of forgetting his promise, well it’s clearly a case of the pot calling the kettle black,” Hassan said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Ismail had cleverly countered Bersatu’s threats not to support his administration by stating that a general election (GE15) must be held if that happens
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hassan said such a move would also see Bersatu receive a lot of flak from the public, and be seen as defiant to the King’s mandate, calling for political stability

                According to Astro Awani, Sarawak DAP chief Chong Chieng Jen said the party could not agree to PSB’s demands
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Chong said that if PSB wanted to cooperate with DAP ahead of the parliamentary elections, the party needs to be sincere and not impose such conditions
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This means we have to drop an existing MP to make way for PSB

                Sarawak DAP entered into discussions about cooperation with other opposition parties in Sarawak in April

                “They are the group we hope to target, and we will also carry out other efforts to attract non-Malay support for Bersatu and Perikatan Nasional (PN).” The former Pemanis assemblyman was asked about the wing’s efforts to attract non-Malay support for Bersatu after the resignation of Segamat MP Edmund Santhara Kumar as the head of the party’s associate wing

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked why non-Malays should join Bersatu when the party is spearheaded by one race only, Chong said that the wing he leads does not fight for race-based issues alone

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Bersatu’s associate wing is more about diversity of issues as opposed to becoming a ‘champion’ fighting for race and racial issues,” said Chong

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Bersatu president Muhyiddin Yassin accepted Santhara’s resignation as the party’s associate wing chairman on July 28

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Santhara will, however, remain a Bersatu member and continue to back Muhyiddin’s leadership, a source told FMT

                But after US House Speaker Pelosi's visit, China's military for the first time fired missiles over Taipei, flew waves of drones over Taiwan's offshore islands, sailed warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and surrounded the self-ruled island in what Taiwan's military said amounted to a practice "blockade"

                The show of capability and resolve comes from a People's Liberation Army (PLA) that is far more formidable than it was during the "Third Taiwan Strait Crisis" in 1996, the last time it fired missiles near Taiwan

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, Aug 7 — Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg today stressed that the state government will protect non-Muslims and care for them to achieve togetherness and inclusion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said as an example the Sarawak government has channeled aid to non-Muslims through the Unit for Other Religions (UNIFOR) on the basis that non-Muslims also need the protection and care of the state government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the state government has also provided an allocation of RM70 million to build UNIFOR Building in Jalan Ong Tiang Swee, Kuching, so that its administration is more organised and the implementation of religious activities under UNIFOR is more orderly
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I am confident and believe that togetherness in terms of religious development between the Muslim and non-Muslim communities in Sarawak will give birth to a society that is friendly to each other and avoids prejudices that can cause division,” the premier said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said as the head of the state government who is a Muslim, he has always insisted that the “Charter of Medina” is a very suitable guide to guarantee fair administration for the multi-ethnic and multi-religious communities in Sarawak

                Johor Baru South OCPD Asst Comm Raub Selamat said that the suspects, aged 25 and 32, were working at the shopping complex where they apprehended the victim and his girlfriend for committing khalwat (close proximity)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a statement today, Shahrizat said that the Court of Appeal's decision reinforcing that Malaysian women cannot confer citizenship is devastating for Malaysian women
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In this case, the Malaysian government had appealed against the High Court's September 9, 2021 decision, which recognised that Malaysia’s citizenship laws discriminated against women and which had ruled that Malaysian mothers whose children are born overseas should also be entitled to Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While waiting for the Court of Appeal to decide on the appeal, the six Malaysian mothers who filed the suit managed to obtain citizenship documents from the National Registration Department (NRD) for their overseas-born children
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This was because the High Court and Court of Appeal refused to allow the government to defer issuing the citizenship papers while waiting for the appeal to be decided
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After the decision on Friday, lawyer for the six Malaysian mothers, Datuk Gurdial Singh Nijar informed the Court of Appeal that his clients would be appealing to the Federal Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Court of Appeal however, ruled that status quo should be maintained for the overseas-born children of the six Malaysian mothers who had obtained the Malaysian citizenship papers, until the Federal Court decides on their appeal

                A recent news report claimed that PN might pull out of the government and withdraw support for Ismail

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Kiandee, who is on the PN Supreme Council, said the coalition had given its commitment to continue supporting the prime minister and the current government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The mandate period of the 14th general election (in 2018) will end in May next year, so we have given our commitment to continue supporting the prime minister and this government
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This is to ensure continued political stability in the country until the general election is called,” he said

                In Kuala Terengganu, PAS vice-president Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar said talk of PN withdrawing support for the government was merely the view of certain quarters
