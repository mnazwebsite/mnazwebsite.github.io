            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Fong Soong Hert  (right) had pleaded guilty to smothering his wife Pek Ying Ling  to death with a pillow
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Fong killed his 51-year-old wife, Pek Ying Ling, on Dec 6 last year at the County Aparthotel in Newcastle, Britain

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, he changed his plea to guilty on Tuesday, the fifth day of his trial at Newcastle Crown Court

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But while they were in Scotland, Fong took a bad fall

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Karl Andersson from the University of Manchester spent three months researching how readers “experience sexual pleasure” when reading Japanese shota comics
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I had hit a wall in my research,” Anderson wrote in the abstract of his 4,000-word article published in the journal Qualitative Research
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “And so I realised that my body was equipped with a research tool of its own that could give me, quite literally, a first-hand understanding of shota.” Andersson, who is originally from Sweden, also concluded that masturbation could be an act of “self-care”, and that the activity was when “we are least alone”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Thinking more critically about my own masturbation also made me wonder if all sex is masturbation, in the sense that people are focused on their own pleasure and use other people as ‘masturbation material’,” he wrote
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While the paper was originally published online in April, it went viral on Twitter earlier this week, sparking debate about research ethics and values
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Many questioned the ethics of the paper, saying it was bordering on paedophilia due to the nature of shota comics

                Former President Donald Trump home in Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Justice Department asked a judge on Thursday to make public the warrant that authorized the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, after Trump, a Republican, portrayed it as political retribution
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In this case, Trump himself announced the search in a Monday night statement

                Will Trump's lawyers object? It was unclear whether Trump's legal team would object to the release of the warrant

                The context as well as the gaffes of the interview evidently displayed that Pelosi was very tense and troubled

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During the interview, Pelosi said that "it was only about saying, China is one of the freest societies in the world, don't take it from me, that's from Freedom House, it's a strong democracy, courageous people." Soon after Pelosi's tongue slip, Drew Hammill, her deputy chief of staff tweeted that what Pelosi referred here is the island of Taiwan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The transcript of the interview from Pelosi's website also replaced "China" with "Taiwan" in this sentence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Many of those who lash out at Pelosi do not even accept the explanation that such a line is tongue slip

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                American hostile against China stirred up by China hawks, represented by Pelosi, has entered a state of irrationality and hysteria
