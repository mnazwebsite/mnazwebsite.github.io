                Cheah had yesterday related in court how he had gone to Najib’s house to open a new personal account with AmIslamic Bank during which the latter directly told him that US$100 million would be deposited into the new account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Cheah, Najib said the money was from Saudi Arabia and purported it was a donation for his “Islamic activity”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Cheah reiterated that Najib volunteered the information about the US$100 million “donation” from the Saudi Arabian government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his testimony yesterday, Cheah related that he had met privately with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) governor Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz to tell her about Najib’s new bank account and the latter’s expectation of US$100 million from Saudi Arabia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah agreed with Shafee today that it was a private bank account and that it was just a matter of courtesy for him to inform the BNM governor about it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Seri Najib must follow all the rules,” Cheah added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meeting Najib at his house for opening of account  Cheah said AmBank's then relationship manager Joanna Yu informed him in 2011 that “VVIP” client Najib wanted to open an account with the bank, and she felt it was not good protocol-wise for her to meet the then prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah said it was the first time he was dealing with Najib, adding that Azman asked him to attend to the matter of helping Najib open the bank account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah said Azlin sent a driver to pick him up from his house to go to Najib’s, confirming that they were the only two occupants in the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Chea affirmed that he saw Low Taek Jho – better known as Jho Low — at Najib’s house during that visit when asked by Shafee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He confirmed that he met Najib alone to set up the latter’s bank account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, who was in the courtroom also giggled at parts of Cheah's testimony

                By Anirban Sen (Reuters) - Elon Musk's U-turn on buying Twitter Inc could not have come at a worse time for the banks funding a large portion of the $44 billion deal and they could be facing significant losses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As in any large acquisition, banks would look to sell the debt to get it off their books
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Musk will provide much of $44 billion by selling down his stake in electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc and by leaning on equity financing from large investors, major banks have committed to provide $12.5 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They include Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp and Barclays Plc
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, BNP Paribas SA, Mizuho Financial Group Inc and Societe Generale SA are also part of the syndicate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Twitter debt package is comprised of $6.5 billion in leveraged loans, $3 billion in secured bonds, and another $3 billion in unsecured bonds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The banks have their backs to the wall - they have no choice but to finance the deal." Leveraged financing sources have also previously told Reuters that potential losses for Wall Street banks involved in the Twitter debt in such a market could run to hundreds of millions of dollars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Societe Generale did not respond to a request for comment while the other banks declined to comment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Twitter also declined to comment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just last week, a group of lenders had to cancel efforts to sell $3.9 billion of debt that financed Apollo Global Management Inc's deal to buy telecom and broadband assets from Lumen Technologies Inc
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That came on the heels of a group of banks having to take a $700 million loss on the sale of about $4.55 billion in debt backing the leveraged buyout of business software company Citrix Systems Inc

                By Anirban Sen (Reuters) - Elon Musk's U-turn on buying Twitter Inc could not have come at a worse time for the banks funding a large portion of the $44 billion deal and they could be facing significant losses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As in any large acquisition, banks would look to sell the debt to get it off their books
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Musk will provide much of $44 billion by selling down his stake in electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc and by leaning on equity financing from large investors, major banks have committed to provide $12.5 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They include Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp and Barclays Plc
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, BNP Paribas SA, Mizuho Financial Group Inc and Societe Generale SA are also part of the syndicate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Twitter debt package is comprised of $6.5 billion in leveraged loans, $3 billion in secured bonds, and another $3 billion in unsecured bonds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The banks have their backs to the wall - they have no choice but to finance the deal." Leveraged financing sources have also previously told Reuters that potential losses for Wall Street banks involved in the Twitter debt in such a market could run to hundreds of millions of dollars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Societe Generale did not respond to a request for comment while the other banks declined to comment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Twitter also declined to comment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just last week, a group of lenders had to cancel efforts to sell $3.9 billion of debt that financed Apollo Global Management Inc's deal to buy telecom and broadband assets from Lumen Technologies Inc
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That came on the heels of a group of banks having to take a $700 million loss on the sale of about $4.55 billion in debt backing the leveraged buyout of business software company Citrix Systems Inc
            </p>

            <p>
                The increase comes days after the return of the F1 Grand Prix race that attracted more than 300,000 people at the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The race was not held in the last two years during the Covid-19 pandemic

            <p>
                Another likely reason for the spike is the large number of people now moving in and out of the country, not just for F1, added Professor Tambyah

                The week-on-week infection ratio was at 1.56, and over the last 28 days, 68,891 people have tested positive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Leong said this trend is normal and each new variant will bring a spike in numbers before the situation settles again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said, so far, most people are reporting only a mild cough and sore throat and perhaps, a fever that will last for a few days

            <p>
                “As long as the hospitalised or intensive care case numbers do not spike up significantly, it is acceptable,” he added

            <p>
                The MOH website on Tuesday said 286 people were in hospital, up from 257 the day before

                Darwin Núñez will be wondering how Liverpool did not end up with a goal from open play, but Jürgen Klopp will not mind too much
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Good A clean sheet! Liverpool have not enjoyed too many this season, but they thoroughly earned one against Rangers, never really looking in any danger of conceding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp did the only thing he could — he changed the system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It would have been a complete bolt from the blue for Rangers, but the psychological impact on Liverpool could have been significant
            </p>

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! The Bad It’s been a while since the ‘bad’ portion of the post-match rundown has been a struggle, but there really wasn’t too much wrong with Liverpool’s performance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rangers could not get close to Liverpool for about 85 minutes of the contest, but they were nearly allowed a way back into it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And if Liverpool are going to have a slower period, it is better that it falls right at the end than at the beginning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah is thriving as more of a creator in this Liverpool team, and having an extra attacker to create more room seemed to play right into his hands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Liverpool look for their answer to Kevin De Bruyne, who is posting scary assist numbers for Manchester City, it could be that they already have their creator-in-chief in Salah

                Darwin Núñez will be wondering how Liverpool did not end up with a goal from open play, but Jürgen Klopp will not mind too much

            <p>
                The Good A clean sheet! Liverpool have not enjoyed too many this season, but they thoroughly earned one against Rangers, never really looking in any danger of conceding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp did the only thing he could — he changed the system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It would have been a complete bolt from the blue for Rangers, but the psychological impact on Liverpool could have been significant

                Rangers could not get close to Liverpool for about 85 minutes of the contest, but they were nearly allowed a way back into it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And if Liverpool are going to have a slower period, it is better that it falls right at the end than at the beginning

                Salah is thriving as more of a creator in this Liverpool team, and having an extra attacker to create more room seemed to play right into his hands

            <p>
                While Liverpool look for their answer to Kevin De Bruyne, who is posting scary assist numbers for Manchester City, it could be that they already have their creator-in-chief in Salah

                These are among several improvements made by the Election Commission (EC) to allow the public more time to vote, said Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Parliament and Law) Datuk Seri Dr Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mukhriz had asked about the EC’s measures to ensure a high voter turnout rate and to guarantee the transparency of the voting process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During GE14 in 2018, the voter turnout was 82.32% and there were long queues at some polling centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Junaidi said the number of voting centres and channels would be increased this time, taking into account Undi18 – which lowered the voting age to 18 – and automatic voter registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is to avoid any congestion at the voting centres and channels,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The EC had said that there would be 9,560 polling centres for GE15, compared to 9,010 centres previously, while polling streams will increase from 29,054 to 38,990
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Junaidi added that a special lane for voters aged 60 and above and the disabled group (OKU) will also be set up and limited to 450 voters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The EC will also abolish the previous conditions for postal voting that were implemented in GE14, he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those who were living in southern Thailand (Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala, Songkhla and Satun), Singapore, Brunei or Kalimantan, did not qualify for postal voting and had to come back to vote

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 5 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob's government will be tabling only his second federal Budget on October 7 but it could be the most significant one for his political career
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the 14th Parliamentary term set to expire by next July, Budget 2023 will be an “election Budget” — to be tabled by Finance Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz — regardless of when the 15th general election is held
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, the country’s ninth prime minister is expected to unveil a spending plan that will push his approval ratings up, which means it’s more than likely to be an expansionary Budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Given that this is an election Budget, we will likely see some form of bigger spending in terms of government expenditure,” said Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, associate director at Vriens & Partners, a political risk consultancy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No political party can confidently predict how this demographic will cast their votes, or if they will even turn up, posing a challenge for Ismail Sabri and his party as they formulate next year’s spending plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It stands at 2.5 per cent at the moment, still lower than pre-Covid levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Given that this Budget will be tabled before the next general election, we expect it to be election friendly with expansionary measures (i.e

            <p>
                Prices of food items rose sharply by over seven per cent in August compared to the same month last year, driving overall inflation up to 4.7 per cent, Department of Statistic Malaysia’s inflation data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Analysts predict the Ismail Sabri-led government will not only continue with cash handouts and subsidies for targeted groups, but may also announce a higher tax relief for the middle class as well as small- and medium-sized enterprises
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We do not expect any new taxes to be introduced for 2023 but the government will further enhance tax compliance and collection..

            <p>
                in other words, a reintroduction of goods and service tax (GST) at a lower rate than the previous 6 per cent is not expected to be announced,” UOB analysts said.

                The process was all done by the book, said AmBank’s non-independent and non-executive director Cheah Tek Kuang, who helped Najib open the current account

                According to Cheah, Azman declined and instructed him to meet with Najib

            <p>
                The process to open Najib’s account, Cheah said, was quite special due to his stature as the prime minister at the time

            <p>
                After the meeting with Najib, Cheah set up a meeting with Zeti to inform her about the opening of the 694 account and the incoming US$100mil from Saudi Arabia
            </p>

                “I agreed to the code name ‘AmPrivate Banking – MR’ for Najib’s account to avoid misuse of private information,” Cheah said

            <p>
                A letter was also sent to Zeti to inform her of the code name, which would make it easier for the central bank to monitor the account

                The Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Parliament and Law) said the Royal Assent for the Bill was received yesterday

            <p>
                The law received assent from the King on Aug 31 and was gazetted on Sept 6, but without the date of enforcement

            <p>
                Following the enforcement of the anti-hopping law, Wan Junaidi said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob would now write to the state governments to adopt the law as part of their own state constitutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Sabah, Sarawak, Kelantan and Penang already have their own anti-hopping laws, Wan Junaidi said the Federal Government wanted the nation to have uniform laws against party hopping

            <p>
                On another matter, Wan Junaidi said the Prime Minister had the sole discretion to determine Parliament’s dissolution, and as such was not bound to discuss it with anyone
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Although Ismail Sabri did raise the matter with the Cabinet two weeks ago, Wan Junaidi said that discussion centred on seeking an audience with the King to propose a date to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                The hotel came under fire after lawyer and social activist Siti Kassim posted a picture of the “non-halal lift” on social media and questioned the rationale behind it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A hotel spokesman explained that they had to have “halal” and “non-halal” lifts for the movement of goods and perishable items
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is part of the halal certification requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There can be cross-contamination with cash, in public transport, and even through donated blood
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Business premises have to abide by a lot of rules to get halal certification, but they should also be brave and ask questions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why are we keeping quiet?” As of press time, Jakim has not responded to The Star over the issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many Star Online readers were also irked by the situation, with one reader even highlighting that raw material in lifts do not touch the floor or the walls of the lift
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is not the first time that “non-halal lift” issues have arisen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2013, a similar incident took place at a hotel in Petaling Jaya
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For non-halal goods, please use the staircase.” The hotel, not wanting to evict its long-time Chinese restaurant tenant, was also obeying Jakim’s rules on the transport of non-halal food as part of its licensing requirements.

                The hotel came under fire after lawyer and social activist Siti Kassim posted a picture of the “non-halal lift” on social media and questioned the rationale behind it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A hotel spokesman explained that they had to have “halal” and “non-halal” lifts for the movement of goods and perishable items
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is part of the halal certification requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There can be cross-contamination with cash, in public transport, and even through donated blood
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Business premises have to abide by a lot of rules to get halal certification, but they should also be brave and ask questions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why are we keeping quiet?” As of press time, Jakim has not responded to The Star over the issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many Star Online readers were also irked by the situation, with one reader even highlighting that raw material in lifts do not touch the floor or the walls of the lift
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is not the first time that “non-halal lift” issues have arisen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2013, a similar incident took place at a hotel in Petaling Jaya
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For non-halal goods, please use the staircase.” The hotel, not wanting to evict its long-time Chinese restaurant tenant, was also obeying Jakim’s rules on the transport of non-halal food as part of its licensing requirements.

            <p>
                One of the most common ways to create this income is to buy yourself an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Essentially, an annuity is an insurance contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will generally be a minimum payment that guarantees you don’t lose your principal, but it’s possible that the money won’t grow at all, which is not a concern with a fixed annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of this is determined when you buy your annuity contact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That percentage only ticks up to 95.9% if you use an annuity, not enough of a difference to justify using an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Social Security Bridge – Another Option Morningstar also details an alternative plan for making sure you have enough money in retirement without having to buy an annuity, a strategy known as the Social Security Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you turn 70, you file for Social Security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you start taking these payments, you can reduce the amount of money you take out of your retirement accounts each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Morningstar analysis, though, shows that if you have at least 36 times your needed annual income saved at the time of retirement, you likely don’t need to get an annuity

                There will generally be a minimum payment that guarantees you don’t lose your principal, but it’s possible that the money won’t grow at all, which is not a concern with a fixed annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of this is determined when you buy your annuity contact

            <p>
                That percentage only ticks up to 95.9% if you use an annuity, not enough of a difference to justify using an annuity

                Social Security Bridge – Another Option Morningstar also details an alternative plan for making sure you have enough money in retirement without having to buy an annuity, a strategy known as the Social Security Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you turn 70, you file for Social Security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you start taking these payments, you can reduce the amount of money you take out of your retirement accounts each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Morningstar analysis, though, shows that if you have at least 36 times your needed annual income saved at the time of retirement, you likely don’t need to get an annuity

                In a statement on Tuesday (Oct 4), the ministry said the article was inaccurate, misleading and gave a negative perception of the overall quality of roads in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also said the article used a report published by Zutobi, an online driver's education company as a reference, which calculated the scores based on only four factors – road quality; improvements in road quality; road deaths and the relative size of the road network, and it only took into account data for 59 countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ministry also explained that another report published by Utusan Malaysia on Aug 10 titled "Kualiti Jalan di Malaysia 21 Terbaik di Dunia, Mengatasi Australia, Britain, New Zealand" (Road quality in Malaysia among 21 best in the world, surpassing Australia, Britain, New Zealand), based on the road quality rankings issued by The Global Economy using the data obtained from the Global Competitiveness Index

            <p>
                Based on the news report, Malaysia scored 5.3 points out of the total seven points to be in the 21st position, surpassing Sweden (23), Canada (31), Australia (33) and Britain (37)
            </p>

            <p>
                Cheah was explaining how he facilitated the opening of Najib’s current account 211-202-200969-4 on Jan 13, 2011 (known as the “9694” account)

            <p>
                The name was assigned to the account “to avoid private information from being misused”

            <p>
                Cheah said he wasn’t sure if Najib was informed of the code name, but that it fell within the purview of the bank’s operation to choose the code name

                Earlier, Cheah said he had first gone to Najib’s house in Jalan Langgak Duta, Kuala Lumpur in 2011 to facilitate the opening of the bank account, after being given the green light by AmBank chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim

                He said he had met Zeti to inform her about it shortly after facilitating the opening of Najib’s account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah was explaining how he facilitated the opening of Najib’s current account 211-202-200969-4 on Jan 13, 2011 (known as the “9694” account)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The purpose of the meeting was to inform her that Najib had opened an account and there were incoming funds of US$100 million from Saudi Arabia,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former MD added that the “AmPrivate Banking-MR” code name was used for Najib’s current account and it was managed by AmBank customer relationship manager Joanna Yu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The name was assigned to the account “to avoid private information from being misused”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah said he wasn’t sure if Najib was informed of the code name, but that it fell within the purview of the bank’s operation to choose the code name

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 4 — Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said that his party’s alliance with PAS can continue for the next general election (GE15) on the condition that the latter cuts its political ties with Perikatan Nasional (PN)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking after the party’s meeting with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob and other top leaders, Ahmad Zahid said that PAS can even use its own logo when campaigning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if Umno had set a deadline for PAS, Ahmad Zahid only stated it should happen sooner rather than later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his insistence on going solo for GE15, he said that it does not mean Umno is brimming with confidence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But if PAS wants to be with Umno and Barisan Nasional (BN), they are free to use their party symbols
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said that he only demanded that PAS cut ties with Bersatu and PN in order to make Muafakat Nasional (MN) a success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from meeting the prime minister, Umno held talks with the party’s division leaders on preparations going into GE15 at the World Trade Centre (WTC) here today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I also want to say about Sabah that I have had a discussion with the leadership of GRS, and they have given their assurance that GRS will support all BN candidates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, the charter to uphold MN’s “ummah unification” agenda between PAS and Umno was revived after both party presidents had a four-eye meeting and indicated a possible alliance for the upcoming polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang’s apparent opposition to GE15 being held this year was seen as a sign that negotiations between the Islamist party and Umno had failed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite that, PAS has yet to conclusively state whether it will work with Umno or Bersatu for GE15.

                It also said that the appointment of KPISoft Malaysia Sdn Bhd to develop the MySejahtera application did not follow procedures set by Putrajaya, and moving forward, the government needs to take a more prudent approach in all procurement processes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wong said while the government had guaranteed that it owned the app, and its data would not be abused, KPISoft was the owner of MySejahtera’s intellectual property
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Cabinet’s decision to procure the app from the app developer goes to show that the app is, in principle, still owned by the developer,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee found that the appointment of KPISoft Sdn Bhd as the MySejahtera application developer in March 2020 was not organised and not in line with the public procurement procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                KPISoft Sdn Bhd, the developer of the MySejahtera application, allowed the government one year to use the app for free and then started to charge the government from April 2021 onward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report said the government was not clear in terms of KPISoft’s appointment, the concept of CSR, and the ownership of MySejahtera
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PAC also found no document showing the one-year time frame set by KPISoft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The development and continuous use of the App should have continued to be a CSR effort
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of April this year, the government had yet to register the intellectual property for the MySejahtera application on MyIPO, which may cause the application to be claimed for ownership by the developer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PAC recommended that the government ensure full ownership of the MySejahtera application, besides the need to guarantee the security of users' personal data in the application and ensure that the data is not misused by any party
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The government needs to continue efforts to make the MySejahtera application a national public health management tool in line with the digitalisation plan for health services,” said Wong in the report

                Lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram today told the High Court of his strong objection to Najib's lead defence lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah's act of issuing a media statement regarding evidence in the ongoing 1MDB trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reading out parts of Shafee's press statement issued on Najib's behalf which claimed that the prosecution had failed to disclose details of five transactions of hundreds of millions that entered Najib's account, Sri Ram said the statement was a "direct attack" on the prosecution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram said this was unfair as the prosecution — which conducts the 1MDB trial in court instead of through the media — could not be making a response in public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With respect, the accused must conduct his trial in court, he cannot be conducting it in public,” he said, referring to Najib as the accused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And we are put in an invidious position, because we cannot respond, I cannot respond in public and it is not proper for me to respond in public,” he pointed out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the three letters purportedly by an alleged Saudi prince Saud Abdulaziz Al-Saud which Najib's lawyers had been showing the High Court in the 1MDB trial of purported promises of hundreds of millions of US dollars as a “gift” to Najib, Sri Ram said these same letters had been rejected by all three tiers of the court in the SRC case against Najib
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is fairness to us, but they cannot say suppressed to us
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee was not present when Sri Ram made his objection, as he was said to be unwell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed informed the High Court that he was not in a position to respond to the objection, and that Shafee will be replying the first thing tomorrow morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram then said he was not inviting judge Collin to make any finding, but that he was merely saying that the prosecution was being put in an "invidious" position by Najib's lawyers as the prosecution was wrongly portrayed to be suppressing evidence

            <p>
                Saravanan slammed the former human resources minister during the Pakatan Harapan administration for imposing a moratorium on the recruitment of workers from Bangladesh on Sept 1, 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "From Sept 1, 2018 to the change of government, we have been lacking foreign workers," said Saravanan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Once the government changed, we took over, but Covid-19 pandemic hit the country and due to this, we could not take any foreign workers for about three years," he said in his reply to M

            <p>
                Kulasegaran (PH-Ipoh Barat) during Question Time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saravanan added that he managed to finalise the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Bangladesh and Indonesia during his tenure, saying that both countries are the largest sources of foreign workers for Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kulasegaran had asked the Human Resources Ministry to explain the initiatives taken to address the shortage of foreign workers in various critical sectors including the plantation sector, which had delayed the country's economic recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The number of foreign workers that are currently working in our country at the moment is about 1.24 million in various sectors," said Saravanan in his reply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So within the next one or two months, we expect to see an estimated 2.1 million foreign workers coming into the country," said Saravanan

                He added that the ministry will review any future application carefully and in an orderly manner to ensure that Malaysia will not end up being a 'dumping ground' for foreign workers.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 4 — Lawyer Datuk Zaid Ibrahim has called for a suspension of all high-profile criminal court cases involving politicians until a new attorney general is appointed replacing incumbent Tan Sri Idrus Harun
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Pending the appointment of a new AG, which is bound to take place after the coming general election, all high-profile cases ought to be suspended,” Zaid was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zaid said there were concerns of selective prosecution in those cases and cited excerpts from a recent book authored by former AG Tan Sri Tommy Thomas — who is now under investigation for sedition among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also blamed Idrus for creating a “negative perception” of the justice system after dropping the bribery and money laundering charges against Baling MP Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim without explanation
            </p>
            
            <p>

                We cannot allow our justice system to be hijacked by any party for use as their political tool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zaid, who was briefly disgraced ex-prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s defence lawyer in the latter’s last SRC International Sdn Bhd appeal at the Federal Court, listed the ongoing court cases against Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Umno Johor chief Tan Sri Shahrir Samad, as well as DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng, and Muda president Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He faulted Idrus for doing nothing to inspire confidence, especially after Najib’s conviction for SRC International
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also claimed “everyone knows” that the trial judge in Najib’s SRC International case should have recused himself due to “serious conflict of interests” and that the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) had issued a report to confirm this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zaid claimed that Najib was “wrongly convicted” as a result of the combination of Thomas’ alleged “indiscretions” and Idrus’ “inaction”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was granted a one-year extension till March 2023 when his two-year contract expired this year.

                It said in a report tabled in Parliament on Oct 4 that this included the appointment of KPISoft (Entomo) as the app’s developer as this was not done according to government procurement procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee found that the government lacked clarity on the direction of the procurement of the app due to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) concept proposed by KPISoft

                “The government was confused in terms of the appointment of KPISoft, the CSR concept and the ownership period of the MySejahtera app,” it said

            <p>
                The committee also said that as of April, the government has yet to register the intellectual property (IP) for MySejahtera on MyIPO, which means the developer could still lay a claim

                Leicester City's James Maddison scored two first-half goals as they beat promoted Nottingham Forest 4-0 on Monday to move off the bottom of the table with their first Premier League win of the season

            <p>
                The pressure, for now, is off Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers, who looked and sounded like someone who could no longer get the best out of his squad following a 6-2 loss at Tottenham Hotspur before the international break

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maddison broke the ice with the first in the 25th minute, his shot from just outside the box deflected in off the arm of Forest defender Scott McKenna, and Harvey Barnes doubled the lead two minutes later with a stellar shot from distance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a stellar all-round display from Maddison, who was disappointed to be overlooked in the latest England squad despite having strong form for much of 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defeat was a fifth in a row for Forest, piling pressure on manager Steve Cooper as he tries to gel a team packed with new signings, and Leicester's first clean sheet in the league this season

            <p>
                'No, we don't have the time,' said Klopp, when asked how he could hone a new system at the training pitches at their base in Kirkby
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is always the job, it is the same job I had when you win 12 games in a row
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp admits he could switch his tactical approach for Tuesday's clash with Rangers  'Usually when you win a lot of games, not everything goes your way, but there is no impact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'We had this wonderful conversation already this year,' said Klopp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We didn't play Chelsea, which meant we couldn't pick anything up and keep it from the Ajax game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'Then, on top of that, we faced Brighton in a very good moment - a very good team with a new manager and we concede these two early goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That in football is never the case and it would not have been the case had we won the game 3-2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'We lost our game completely, nobody could recognise us anymore,' said Klopp
            </p>

                Tuesday, 04 Oct 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just days after the Umno supreme council decided that Parliament must be dissolved this year, the Prime Minister will be at a special meeting today with Umno division leaders and the party president
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Thursday, he will have an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While this could be just their regular weekly meet, there is much talk that the question of the King’s consent for dissolution will arise during the meeting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The day after Ismail Sabri meets the King, the government will table the Budget for 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And it may even be done by the Prime Minister himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Several sources, however, downplayed the meeting with the King, saying it was a weekly audience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister meets the King on Tuesdays or Wednesdays before the weekly Cabinet meeting but this time, it’s scheduled for a Thursday

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just days after the Umno supreme council decided that Parliament must be dissolved this year, the Prime Minister will be at a special meeting today with Umno division leaders and the party president
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Thursday, he will have an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While this could be just their regular weekly meet, there is much talk that the question of the King’s consent for dissolution will arise during the meeting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The day after Ismail Sabri meets the King, the government will table the Budget for 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And it may even be done by the Prime Minister himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Several sources, however, downplayed the meeting with the King, saying it was a weekly audience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister meets the King on Tuesdays or Wednesdays before the weekly Cabinet meeting but this time, it’s scheduled for a Thursday
            </p>

                Against Manchester United, Haaland had 35 touches of the ball - more than he has managed in any other match this season

                Pep Guardiola has managed to turn Haaland in to the perfect striker to link up the play Boss Guardiola (R) is getting more out of Haaland and he can get even better if it continues I mentioned Shearer's mental strength at the start of this column because I saw that first-hand when we formed the SAS at Blackburn

                Guardiola is getting more out of Haaland than ever - and this is only the beginning.

                Leicester City's James Maddison scored two first-half goals as they beat promoted Nottingham Forest 4-0 on Monday to move off the bottom of the table with their first Premier League win of the season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pressure, for now, is off Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers, who looked and sounded like someone who could no longer get the best out of his squad following a 6-2 loss at Tottenham Hotspur before the international break
            </p>

                Maddison broke the ice with the first in the 25th minute, his shot from just outside the box deflected in off the arm of Forest defender Scott McKenna, and Harvey Barnes doubled the lead two minutes later with a stellar shot from distance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a stellar all-round display from Maddison, who was disappointed to be overlooked in the latest England squad despite having strong form for much of 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defeat was a fifth in a row for Forest, piling pressure on manager Steve Cooper as he tries to gel a team packed with new signings, and Leicester's first clean sheet in the league this season

                Manchester United will allow Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Old Trafford in the January transfer window, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo’s future at United has looked increasingly in doubt since the start of the season as he has started just one of the club’s seven Premier League games so far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag and United were adamant that Ronaldo would not be sold in the summer, but according to The Telegraph, both the club and the manager have agreed to let the Portugal international depart if a suitable offer arrives in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report claims that Ronaldo is still hoping to leave United before the end of the season but has remained ‘highly professional’ despite his lack of playing time under Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo was left on the bench for United’s 6-3 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, with Ten Hag admitting that he didn’t want to disrespect the 37-year-old by bringing him on as a substitute when the team were trailing by four goals by half time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                video Speaking after the 6-3 defeat to City, former United captain Roy Keane accused the club of ‘disrespecting’ Ronaldo by keeping him in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘I think the manager holding onto him, okay, you say you need options, but if you don’t hold onto Ronaldo to sit on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But generally speaking, the bigger picture, he’s not going to play Ronaldo, we know that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘Okay, Ronaldo’s motivated with the World Cup coming up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if he’s sitting on the bench for Man United week in week out, it’s not good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘I think United have shown nothing but disrespect to Ronaldo, they should’ve let him go when the opportunity came.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page

                Manchester United will allow Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Old Trafford in the January transfer window, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo’s future at United has looked increasingly in doubt since the start of the season as he has started just one of the club’s seven Premier League games so far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag and United were adamant that Ronaldo would not be sold in the summer, but according to The Telegraph, both the club and the manager have agreed to let the Portugal international depart if a suitable offer arrives in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report claims that Ronaldo is still hoping to leave United before the end of the season but has remained ‘highly professional’ despite his lack of playing time under Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo was left on the bench for United’s 6-3 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, with Ten Hag admitting that he didn’t want to disrespect the 37-year-old by bringing him on as a substitute when the team were trailing by four goals by half time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                video Speaking after the 6-3 defeat to City, former United captain Roy Keane accused the club of ‘disrespecting’ Ronaldo by keeping him in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘I think the manager holding onto him, okay, you say you need options, but if you don’t hold onto Ronaldo to sit on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But generally speaking, the bigger picture, he’s not going to play Ronaldo, we know that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘Okay, Ronaldo’s motivated with the World Cup coming up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if he’s sitting on the bench for Man United week in week out, it’s not good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘I think United have shown nothing but disrespect to Ronaldo, they should’ve let him go when the opportunity came.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Higuain, 34, will play out the rest of the season with Miami, which is currently in the playoff positions in Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference with two games left to play

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Higuain departed after seven seasons in Madrid, moving to Napoli in the summer of 2013 for $53.1m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the summer of 2016, Juventus activated a release clause in Higuain's contract, allowing them to acquire the Argentine for just under $100m, a Serie A record at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After an impressive initial season that saw him score 32 goals, Higuain's production soon dropped off, leading the Bianconeri to loan him out to be both AC Milan and Chelsea during the 2018-19 campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After one final season with Juventus in 2019-20, in which he helped the club to a third Serie A title during his tenure there, Higuain moved to Inter Miami, where he has scored 27 goals and added 14 assists in 65 league appearances

                He was part of the Juventus side that lost the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League final, 4-1 to Real Madrid, as well as the Argentina side that fell to Germany in the 2014 World Cup final, a match that saw Higuain spurn several chances, including a one-on-one with Germany keeper Manuel Neuer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Higuain will still go down as one of the better forwards of his generation, having scored over 300 goals at club level

                He was part of the Juventus side that lost the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League final, 4-1 to Real Madrid, as well as the Argentina side that fell to Germany in the 2014 World Cup final, a match that saw Higuain spurn several chances, including a one-on-one with Germany keeper Manuel Neuer

            <p>
                Warren Buffett is widely considered to be one of the most successful investors of all time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Berkshire trades at about $400,000 and Buffett has a net worth of $97 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This strategy involves selling an option where you promise to buy a stock at a specific strike price below its current value sometime in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This immediately gives you money from the sale of the option
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the share price doesn’t fall, you keep the money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the price does fall below the strike price, you purchase the stock at a price that’s less than you would have paid at the time you sold the option, with the cash from the option sale further reducing your cost basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is a good strategy on a stock that you wouldn't mind owning in the first place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The option is considered “naked” because you haven’t secured another option to buy the stock, such as shorting shares of that same stock to offset your purchase cost
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But just because those little outfits are off-limits to Buffett today doesn’t mean you can’t go after them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Buffett’s “buy and hold” approach doesn’t extend to never admitting that even he sometimes gets it wrong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for Buffett, his big misstep recently was investing in airline companies

                Johor police chief Comm Datuk Kamarul Zaman Mamat said police were notified about the incident at Jalan Ria 2 after the victim’s father lodged a report between 10pm and 11pm on Sunday (Oct 2) night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that police arrested the 28-year-old salesman, who had priors, and a 40-year-old Indonesian maid on Monday (Oct 3) afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The victim and his younger sibling, who is one year old, has been under the suspect’s care, three months ago,” he said in a press conference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Comm Kamarul Zaman added that only the victim was abused as the body showed bruise marks and small wounds, while the younger sibling did not suffer any injuries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the body has been sent to Sultanah Aminah Hospital for a post mortem, while the police would bring the two suspects to the Johor Baru magistrate’s court for a remand application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Comm Kamarul Zaman added the police would investigate the case under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder
            </p>

                The police will be firm to ensure that guilty parties are brought to justice," he added.

            <p>
                Credit Suisse doesn’t face any one issue on the scale of Deutsche Bank’s $7.2 billion settlement, and its key capital ratio of 13.5% is higher than the 10.8% that the German firm had six years ago

                On Friday, Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Koerner reassured staff that the bank has a “strong capital base and liquidity position” and told employees that he will be sending them a regular update until the firm announces a new strategic plan on Oct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Koerner, who was named CEO in late July, has had to deal with market speculation, banker exits and capital doubts as he seeks to set a path forward for the troubled Swiss bank

            <p>
                Credit Suisse’s market capitalization dropped to around 10 billion Swiss francs, meaning any share sale would be highly dilutive to longtime holders

            <p>
                The market value was above 30 billion francs as recently as March 2021

            <p>
                Credit Suisse executives have noted that the firm’s 13.5% CET1 capital ratio at June 30 was in the middle of the planned range of 13% to 14% for 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The five-year credit default swaps price of about 250 basis points is up from about 55 basis points at the start of the year and is near their highest on record
            </p>

                Deutsche Bank saw its credit-default swaps climb, its debt rating downgraded and some clients step back from working with it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Credit Suisse doesn’t face any one issue on the scale of Deutsche Bank’s $7.2 billion settlement, and its key capital ratio of 13.5% is higher than the 10.8% that the German firm had six years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stress Deutsche Bank faced in 2016 resulted in the unusual dynamic where the cost of insuring against losses on the lender’s debt for one year surpassed that of protection for five years

                The five-year credit default swaps price of about 250 basis points is up from about 55 basis points at the start of the year and is near their highest on record

            <p>
                Credit Suisse doesn’t face any one issue on the scale of Deutsche Bank’s $7.2 billion settlement, and its key capital ratio of 13.5% is higher than the 10.8% that the German firm had six years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stress Deutsche Bank faced in 2016 resulted in the unusual dynamic where the cost of insuring against losses on the lender’s debt for one year surpassed that of protection for five years

                The asking price for the 330i M Sport Runout Edition is RM288,680, making it RM5,000 more than a regular 330i M Sport that retails at RM283,680

                I wonder why BMW Malaysia really is still so dumb that a runout edition special edition can’t even have driving assistant plus with adaptive cruise control, but instead they put other useless features that look nice

                BMW Malaysia profit margins must be crazy

                You will surely missed pretty sexy girls in a fully loaded Myvi compared to a kosong BMW
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You will surely feel jealous driving in your fully loaded Myvi while seeing your once classmate drove a kosong BMW beside you
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You will feel depress more in a Myvi because almost all ppl will say, hah? U drive Myvi? Why buy Myvi Bro? Or u must be asholl because u r myvi driver nevermind fully loaded

            <p>
                But the plan triggered a crisis of investor confidence in the government, hammering the value of the pound and government bond prices and jolting global markets to such an extent that the Bank of England had to intervene with a 65 billion pound ($73 billion) programme to shore up the markets

            <p>
                While the removal of the top rate of tax only made up around 2 billion out of a 45 billion pound tax-cutting plan, it was the most eye-catching element of a fiscal package that was to be funded by government borrowing, with Kwarteng not explaining how it would be paid for in the long-term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision to reverse course is likely to put Truss and Kwarteng under huge pressure, less than four weeks after they came to power

                Finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng said the decision was taken with "humility and contrition", after some lawmakers from the ruling Conservative Party reacted with fury to suggestions that public and welfare spending could be cut to fund tax cuts for the richest

                No more distractions." Truss - elected as prime minister by party members but not the broader public - is seeking to jolt the economy out of a decade of stagnant growth with a 1980s-style plan to cut taxes and regulation, all funded by vast government borrowing

            <p>
                Signalling a break with "Treasury orthodoxy", she and Kwarteng also fired the most senior official in the government's finance department and released the tax cut plan without accompanying forecasts on how much it would cost
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We just look incompetent now, too." Another party insider said the Conservative government, in power under different leaders for 12 years but with Truss as prime minister only since Sept

                Constance, better known as Connie, was believed to be in her 70s

                Constance's old friend and fellow radio announcer Patrick Teoh announced the news of her death on his Facebook page Monday (Oct 3)

            <p>
                Constance was known as one of the golden voices of radio and had opted out of service at age 45 after working for 26 years

            <p>
                In her glittering career, Constance had interviewed Gloria Estafan, Dionne Warwick, Jose Feliciano, Bjorn Borg, the Bee Gees and Omar Sharif

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 3 — The reason many areas that supposedly should have 5G internet connection still haven't is because the telecommunication companies are not playing ball with the government, Deputy Minister of Communications and Multimedia Datuk Zahidi Zainul Abidin said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "First and foremost, please inform the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) if your area has poor internet access
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We at the MCMC give the money to build these transmission stations using government and taxpayers money but the telcos are in charge of fastening the transmitters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We at MCMC can only ask them or implore them to place these transmitters to increase the strength of the transmitters while DNB don't have the authority to force them or reprimand them for not doing so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He encouraged the public to report their poor internet connection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said boosting internet signals to rural areas will cost a lot of money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However this costs money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We can take money from the SB (statutory bodies) fund or state government money as they have their own multimedia agencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The contention over 5G rollout in the country began when the government decided to create DNB, a special purpose vehicle to roll out the network in the country under a single wholesale network model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After much objection from the telcos who proposed a dual wholesale network to counter the single wholesale network, the government decided to offer a 70 per cent stake in DNB to the players while keeping 30 per cent and holding a golden share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal to take up a stake in DNB also requires shareholders to be 5G access seekers — they must also buy 5G capacity from DNB — with Tengku Zafrul also saying that foreign players were "knocking on our doors" to participate.

            <p>
                "We at MCMC can only ask them or implore them to place these transmitters to increase the strength of the transmitters while DNB don't have the authority to force them or reprimand them for not doing so

                He encouraged the public to report their poor internet connection

                He said boosting internet signals to rural areas will cost a lot of money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However this costs money

                We can take money from the SB (statutory bodies) fund or state government money as they have their own multimedia agencies

            <p>
                The contention over 5G rollout in the country began when the government decided to create DNB, a special purpose vehicle to roll out the network in the country under a single wholesale network model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After much objection from the telcos who proposed a dual wholesale network to counter the single wholesale network, the government decided to offer a 70 per cent stake in DNB to the players while keeping 30 per cent and holding a golden share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal to take up a stake in DNB also requires shareholders to be 5G access seekers — they must also buy 5G capacity from DNB — with Tengku Zafrul also saying that foreign players were "knocking on our doors" to participate.

                In data released on Monday (Oct 3), the firm said Malaysian road quality has decreased by over 5% in the last five years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Over 22 road traffic fatalities per 100,000 have occurred on Malaysia's highways — the second highest number of road traffic deaths in the world after Saudi Arabia,” it said

                The road quality score has dropped by more than 20% in five years. It was 4.6 in 2014, and dropped to 3.7 by 2019

            <p>
                Kuwait also has the third highest number of road traffic deaths per 100,000 people at almost 19

                In data released on Monday (Oct 3), the firm said Malaysian road quality has decreased by over 5% in the last five years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Over 22 road traffic fatalities per 100,000 have occurred on Malaysia's highways — the second highest number of road traffic deaths in the world after Saudi Arabia,” it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The road quality score has dropped by more than 20% in five years. It was 4.6 in 2014, and dropped to 3.7 by 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kuwait also has the third highest number of road traffic deaths per 100,000 people at almost 19
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It has the best road quality, as well as the fewest road traffic deaths at 1.69 per 100,000 people

                The MACC chief commissioner said the number of corruption cases with women as the perpetrators was on the rise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When I first joined the organisation, which was then known as BPR (Badan Pencegah Rasuah), there was hardly a woman arrested for corruption in a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Corruption is about people who have power, the people who are given the trust and responsibility, ” he said in an interview here recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MACC was established on Oct 1, 1967
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was formerly known as the Anti-Corruption Agency (BPR) before becoming an independent commission in 2009
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked about political funding, Azam said there was a need to formulate a law on it to expedite the requirements for politicians and political parties to declare the funds they received
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether political funding was lawful or not depends on the definition in the law, which may differ from one country to another, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Malaysia, he said, there was no law yet governing funds received by politicians and political parties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, it is not a crime for politicians and political parties to accept political funding and donations, he said, adding that they could accept political donations from corporations or individuals, provided the money is not from unlawful sources
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Azam said the commission received many complaints about political entities receiving funds in the form of bribes

            <p>
                A prior constitutional amendment in July 2019 which was also unanimously passed in Parliament saw the lowering of the minimum voting age to 18 from 21, as well as allowing for automatic voter registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The law, which has been gazetted and in force since Dec 15 last year, will allow 21.2million Malaysians to vote in GE15

            <p>
                A total of 29 new bills have been passed by the House, which included the long-awaited Anti-Sexual Harassment Bill, which will allow victims of sexual harassment (verbal, non-verbal, visual, gestural or physical) to report the harassment and have their case heard in a closed-door tribunal

                What’s ahead Friday’s tabling of Budget 2023 will be a key focus of Parliament, along with the tabling of the Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022, which seeks to prohibit those born on and after Jan 1, 2007, from purchasing or possessing cigarettes or vape products
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 2, the Dewan Rakyat agreed that the Tobacco Product and Smoking Control Bill 2022 be referred to a Parliamentary Select Committee to examine and make recommendations for improvement, when the Bill was in its second reading

                Malaysians, say political observers, are looking forward to seeing what is in store for them and what the coalition government under Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob has got to offer in Budget 2023

                According to the Parliament website, the Supply (Budget) Bill 2023 will be tabled by Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz at 4pm this Friday

                PIERS MORGAN branded Erik ten Hag an "arrogant, deluded twerp" after the Manchester United manager left Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench against City
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Quizzed after the match about why he elected not to bring the Portuguese forward on, Ten Hag claimed it was "out of respect for his big career"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                you know Ronaldo would have been desperate to come on, whatever the score." Ronaldo has started just one Premier League match this season - the 4-0 hammering at Brentford in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After his side's defeat, Ten Hag claimed that his side didn't believe in themselves enough
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All the credit to City, but it's nothing to do with City "For me it was a surprise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We were not on the front foot, we were not brave on the ball and there were spaces to play but we were not brave enough
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "All the credit to City, but it's nothing to do with City, our performance was not good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We let our fans down, we let ourselves down and we're hugely disappointed."  Jack Grealish celebrates with a Chinese takeaway after ‘great day at the office’  Man Utd fans tear into Gary Neville after he tipped win before City triumph  Ten Hag reveals incredible reason he left Ronaldo on bench in City thrashing  Defiant Defoe posts cosy pic with wife as it emerges he begged nurse for sex ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No

                In Naples, Koulibaly was known for his explosive physical strength but it was used in conjunction with strong tactical intelligence.  Kim Min-jae has been a huge success since joining Napoli in the summer from Fenerbahce By contrast, Kim seems to prefer direct aggression - and it's working too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Koulibaly is certainly among the strongest defenders in the world and will be remembered as a Napoli icon but Kim looks set to be even more useful to the Italian side.  Kim uses all the dark arts a defender can use during a game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His aggressive form of defending has already rattled Premier League sides including Liverpool Kim's physical strength has been key in helping Napoli lead Serie A in the early stages this term Standing at 190cm and about 88kg, moving Kim is like trying to shift Mount Vesuvius
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his giant physique and aggressive nature, Kim appears to stick to the rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim is inspired by Sergio Ramos and Fabio Cannavaro but soon dreams of inheriting the leadership of Koulibaly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim though has not allowed such a move to hinder his game - he appears to now thrive on the pressure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim is focused precisely on his career and his move from Fenerbahce underlines his desire to become an elite player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rival clubs could soon be showing interest in Kim though as in his 40-page contract there is a €50m (£44m) release clause
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Considering his physical attributes, Kim would be the ideal player in any top international club but would probably be perfectly at home in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United have shown interest in Kim, who has been compared to club captain Harry Maguire in terms of his strength but of having greater concentration Kim signed a contract of three years plus another 24 months on top as an option to Napoli
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim has the physique of Harry Maguire but compared to the English defender he has exceptional concentration which makes him difficult to overcome

                And as what we've seen in Chinese tech companies, (restructuring) is something that happens every year,” she noted.

            <p>
                If Sea had waited two or three more years, the restructuring would have been a lot more painful than now.” The layoffs in the tech industry come following pandemic-fuelled growth in the sector

                As before, three body styles are offered, including the regular Corolla (sedan), Corolla Touring (wagon) and Corolla Sport (hatchback), all of which benefit from visual, mechanical and equipment revisions

            <p>
                The Corolla and Corolla Touring both share the same face as the Levin sold in China (we get the European look in Malaysia), and this has been tweaked so the large lower intake no longer has a honeycomb insert
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the Corolla Sport, which matches the hatchback European and United States customers get, it receives a more expressive front apron with more prominent fog lamp surrounds as well as an arrow-themed insert for its lower intake

            <p>
                The hybrid powertrain comes with an e-CVT to send drive to the front wheels, although the Corolla and Corolla Touring can also be had with the E-Four all-wheel drive system that adds a rear 1WM electric motor with 41 PS and 84 Nm

                In addition to the revised hybrid powertrain, the Corolla and Corolla Touring also receive a new 1.5 litre Dynamic Force naturally-aspirated three-cylinder petrol engine to replace the previous 2ZR-FAE 1.8 litre NA four-cylinder unit
            </p>

                Meanwhile, the Corolla Sport also gets a Dynamic Force engine to replace the previous 8NR-FTS 1.2 litre turbocharged four-pot (116 PS and 185 Nm)

                The Corolla retails for between 1.99 and 2.998 million yen (RM63,756 and RM96,050) in Japan, while the Corolla Touring is from 2.07 to 3.048 million yen (RM66,319 to RM97,652) and the Corolla Sport is priced between 2.2 and 2.89 million yen (RM70,485 and RM92,592)

                The recent reopening of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan is likely to further increase year-end flights
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Already, the recent reopening of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan is likely to further increase year-end flights, as airlines respond to demand from Asian travellers, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pre-Covid-19, China accounted for about 20 per cent of Singapore's tourists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We plan with the capacity in mind, but we also need to be vigilant." He was responding to questions from Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC) and Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC), who were concerned about Changi Airport's capacity to handle higher year-end flight volumes during the winter season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saktiandi was also worried that the authorities might have over-budgeted when it set the target for 80 per cent of pre-Covid-19 flights by the year end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Iswaran said there is predictability to these figures, which are derived from airlines when they submit to Changi Airport for flight slots that they operate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had said previously that the sector wanted to hire another 4,000 people by the year end, restoring manpower to 90 per cent of 2019 levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From Oct 30, there will be an additional daily service to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport, bringing the number of flights SIA operates daily to Japan’s capital to four
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will also be a second daily flight to Osaka

            <p>
                The service to Fukuoka will increase to three flights per week

                This comes after the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, EP Blueshark had received approval by the road transport department (JPJ) for the licensing and registration of its electric two-wheeler products, which itself followed the conditional approval for the construction of its first manufacturing plant in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The approval from MITI was granted under the Industrial Coordination Act 1975, and has been applied retrospectively from July 25, 2022, the company said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having received the manufacturing license from MITI, EP Manufacturing will, in its initial years be on its way to producing 50,000 units of the Blueshark electric scooter per year, it said, and foresees that future demand will call for increased production capacity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In March this year, EP Manufacturing signed an agreement with Sharkgulf Technologies Group and CIS Pride Silver Rock Fund for the manufacture and distribution of two-wheeled EVs in Malaysia and other Southeast Asian markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sharkgulf makes the Blueshark R1, an electric scooter rated to produce 6.7 hp, powered by two 1.44 kWh batteries for a combined 2.88 kWh of capacity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Blueshark R1 weighs 92 kg without batteries, has a payload rating of 200 kg and a seat height of 760 mm, along with linked front and rear disc brakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are front and rear recording cameras, and rear-facing ultrasonic sensors monitor the Blueshark R1’s distance from surrounding vehicles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Braking is by front and rear disc brakes which are linked.

                This comes after the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, EP Blueshark had received approval by the road transport department (JPJ) for the licensing and registration of its electric two-wheeler products, which itself followed the conditional approval for the construction of its first manufacturing plant in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The approval from MITI was granted under the Industrial Coordination Act 1975, and has been applied retrospectively from July 25, 2022, the company said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Having received the manufacturing license from MITI, EP Manufacturing will, in its initial years be on its way to producing 50,000 units of the Blueshark electric scooter per year, it said, and foresees that future demand will call for increased production capacity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In March this year, EP Manufacturing signed an agreement with Sharkgulf Technologies Group and CIS Pride Silver Rock Fund for the manufacture and distribution of two-wheeled EVs in Malaysia and other Southeast Asian markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sharkgulf makes the Blueshark R1, an electric scooter rated to produce 6.7 hp, powered by two 1.44 kWh batteries for a combined 2.88 kWh of capacity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Blueshark R1 weighs 92 kg without batteries, has a payload rating of 200 kg and a seat height of 760 mm, along with linked front and rear disc brakes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are front and rear recording cameras, and rear-facing ultrasonic sensors monitor the Blueshark R1’s distance from surrounding vehicles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Braking is by front and rear disc brakes which are linked.
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Many researchers are advocating for and urging the government to impose foreign exchange (forex) controls, that is pegging the ringgit to the US dollar, to mitigate the current and expected decline in the value of the ringgit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Is this the right move? First of all, we have to realise that the currency depreciation is not unique to Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Secondly, exchange rate controls would mean intervention in the forex market to defend the ringgit and this will come at a hefty price to the country’s foreign exchange reserves (see chart)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the exchange rate is fixed as proposed, the country is likely to experience a drop in competitiveness due to external shocks, which will affect its reserves
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Studies have also shown that a fixed exchange rate is unsustainable when there is an unexpected increase in government spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Broadly speaking, a currency contagion or spillover can happen in the short, or medium to long term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The short-term drivers of currency contagion are often associated with market sentiments, financial panic and herding behaviour, as Keynes (1970) famously said, “It is better to have failed conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.” The medium to long-term currency contagion or spillover is usually driven by trade and financial linkages, external shocks and similarities in macroeconomic vulnerability indicators to the country of shock origin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What is needed in the long term is a buffer against the exchange rate shocks by strengthening the fundamentals of the country, which goes beyond the traditional growth and macroeconomic indicators
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the results are not expected to be immediate, it is necessary to ensure the future competitiveness of our country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The policy focus should not be on controlling the exchange rate or implementing a pegged exchange rate regime
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ringgit is expected to rebound and we will experience stronger long-term trends if we can strengthen our economic fundamentals

                The assistant to the director of a hospitality company in Reading said he had wired all his money to the UK in 2019 at an average exchange rate of HK$10.71 with the pound

            <p>
                Jeffrey Leung, 40, who owns a skiing school based in Niseko, Hokkaido, seized the chance in late August to buy 20 million yen (US$138,220) through a broker at an average exchange rate of HK$1 to 17 yen because he wanted to expand his business

            <p>
                The exchange rate for the yen was HK$1 to 18.4288 yen on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We actually have business needs, that’s why we need to buy yen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The further slide in yen doesn’t really matter to me and my business partners,” Leung said, emphasising they were not speculating for profit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said he had spent HK$30,000 to buy yen for the trip a few days ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The exchange rate is really alluring, even though the package is more expensive than the period before the pandemic hit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gabriel Leung Wai-chun, director of the Birdy Exchange Company in Hong Kong, said he had noticed more customers buying yen for travel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They’ve been longing to travel and took advantage of a very low currency rate,” Leung said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are seeing Hong Kong investors that are gradually accumulating to benefit from favourable exchange rates.” Casanova added most people that had bought the yen and British currency were people who wanted to travel or relocate and were not speculators

            <p>
                Gabriel Leung Wai-chun, director of the Birdy Exchange Company in Hong Kong, said he had noticed more customers buying yen for travel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They’ve been longing to travel and took advantage of a very low currency rate,” Leung said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are seeing Hong Kong investors that are gradually accumulating to benefit from favourable exchange rates.” Casanova added most people that had bought the yen and British currency were people who wanted to travel or relocate and were not speculators

                All in all, next year could shape up to be a bumper year for tourism in Asia

            <p>
                Japan has announced that it will reopen to all international visitors, allowing individual travel for tourism purposes to restart from October 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thailand, meanwhile, has ended its state of emergency in relation to Covid-19 and, as of October 1, it will no longer be necessary to present proof of vaccination or a negative test upon arrival to enter the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Vietnam, the visa waiver for stays of less than 15 days is once again valid, and a Covid test is no longer mandatory upon arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, in Hong Kong, foreign visitors are no longer required to quarantine on arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, the big hitters of the Asian tourism scene are gearing up to welcome back their visitors after two and a half years of pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, many signals point to more tourists being drawn to the Asian continent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asia will see the smallest increase in rates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, rates could rise by +7% in Dubai
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If 2023 should be a year of recovery for tourism on the Asian continent, the effect will still be limited by several factors

                And it really goes back to this idea that after 25 years of quiescent inflation, we had a breakout in the readings

            <p>
                That’s now been over a year and obviously really feeding into the Fed’s imperative to get inflation under control by going on this unprecedented degree of hiking

                Because it was clear the policy mismatch between the new Truss government and Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and where the Bank of England felt it needs to go -- needed to go, needs to go, and that’s an open concept, which is why I keep changing tenses -- is that it’s really caused this instability that got some feeling as if there was this idea that the UK was about to become an emerging market

                Sunday, 02 Oct 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Seri Siti Nurhaliza shared the stage with South Korean heartthrob Lee Min-ho at a concert in Kuala Lumpur last night (Oct 1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Being a fan of Lee, Siti wanted a selfie with the Pachinko star but photo with him was not allowed unless taken by an official photographer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "But once I was on stage (with Lee) I wasn't going to let go of the golden opportunity to take a selfie with him," Siti wrote in an Instagram post today (Oct 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Armed with courage and a mobile phone in hand, the resourceful singer asked KC Hoe, the founder and CEO of Cuckoo – who was also on stage – if she could get a selfie with Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And so did Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mission accomplished!" wrote Siti who posted several photos and a video of her encounter with Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Star's Malay-language portal, mStar reported that Lee told media backstage that he was happy to be back in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 35-year-old last visited our country in 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am happy to be back to Malaysia
            </p>

            <p>
                Datuk Seri Siti Nurhaliza shared the stage with South Korean heartthrob Lee Min-ho at a concert in Kuala Lumpur last night (Oct 1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Being a fan of Lee, Siti wanted a selfie with the Pachinko star but photo with him was not allowed unless taken by an official photographer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "But once I was on stage (with Lee) I wasn't going to let go of the golden opportunity to take a selfie with him," Siti wrote in an Instagram post today (Oct 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Armed with courage and a mobile phone in hand, the resourceful singer asked KC Hoe, the founder and CEO of Cuckoo – who was also on stage – if she could get a selfie with Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And so did Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mission accomplished!" wrote Siti who posted several photos and a video of her encounter with Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Star's Malay-language portal, mStar reported that Lee told media backstage that he was happy to be back in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 35-year-old last visited our country in 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am happy to be back to Malaysia
            </p>

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, October 2 — Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s (Bersatu) Youth Chief Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal today labelled Umno President Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi as a “lunatic” and “anti-science” person for continuously calling for the 15th general election (GE15) to be held soon despite the monsoon season warning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This Umno is mad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They know how hard the flood is, they still want to press the government to dissolve the Parliament, right? But the lunatic ones are just a few in that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among them, the president who is a lunatic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He is mad and he is also anti-science, because the environment minister (Environment and Water Minister Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man), our Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim said that the meteorological department already said that when November comes, there will be a monsoon transition and like the previous year, the flood that hit our country is not the same like in the previous years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whoever does not understand scientific knowledge, they are surely stupid when it comes to understanding the flood this time around
            </p>

                Huge flood which is burdensome to Malaysians,” he said in his speech
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her speech earlier, Bersatu’s Srikandi Wing chief, Datuk Seri Rina Mohd Harun also chastised those pushing for GE15 to be held soonest, adding that it would affect the efforts of the government which has already gazetted many schools as flood relief centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the Women, Family and Community Development Minister, 6,010 temporary flood evacuation centres have been identified for flood victims, nationwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Imagine, the 6,010 temporary flood evacuation centres which are made up of schools, community halls, halls

            <p>
                So, which one is it? Should we make it into temporary flood evacuation centres for flood victims or make it into places for us to cast our votes? Please comment,” she said, adding that while Bersatu is not afraid of the polls, it has to think of the plight of those who will be affected by the floods

                Panic at the soccer match between Arema FC and Persebaya of Surabaya city left over at least 174 people dead, most of whom were trampled to death after police fired tear gas to dispel the riots

                A view shows the aftermath of a riot and stampede following soccer matches between Arema vs Persebaya at Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang, East Java province, Indonesia, October 2, 2022

            <p>
                local time on Saturday, a match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya kicks off at the Kanjuruhan Stadium, Malang in East Java, Indonesia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                the match ends with the home team Arema losing 3-2 to Persebaya Surabaya
            </p>

                Police fire tear gas in a bid to control the situation, prompting panicked fans to scramble to leave through an exit gate, triggering a stampede and cases of suffocation, East Java police chief Nico Afinta tells reporters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The police chief says a crush occurs at gate 10 in the stadium

                Red Bull Racing's Dutch driver Max Verstappen drives during the qualifying session ahead of the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix night race at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore on October 1, 2022

            <p>
                Runaway Formula One world championship leader Verstappen was on course to snatch pole from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc when he was told to abort his final flying lap and return to the pits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That prompted an expletive-laden tirade over the team radio from the fiery Dutchman as he was left languishing on the fourth row of the grid to start Sunday's night race

            <p>
                The team had sent him out with enough fuel for five laps in the final qualifying run but Verstappen went for a sixth, backing off his previous lap to take advantage of the evolving track conditions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "When you under-fuel it or you don't plan to do six laps, then at least you track it throughout the session that you're not going to make it," said Verstappen, who said he could have taken pole had he been informed of the fuel situation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "They should have let me finish the lap before where I think we were already on a pole position lap," said Verstappen

            <p>
                "I can't see how much fuel is in the car, but we have all the sensors in the world to track these things

                Home to nearly 275 million people, Indonesia has rarely been able to harness its potential and has failed to qualify for the World Cup since its one and only appearance in 1938, when the country was still known as the Dutch East Indies

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 2 — It may have only been a five-sen change for some, but local coffee chain retailer ZUS Coffee has come under social media users for their dismissive response

                He was surprised when the cashier told him that they were out of five sen coins and proceeded to only give him a 20 sen change instead — five sen short of the change he should have received

            <p>
                Fdaus then responded to the cashier saying that he should’ve received 30 sen instead of 20 sen as the coffee shop was the one who was short on change

            <p>
                “No, I’m not trying to be fussy, but the issue here is not about the five sen, 50 sen or RM50 value — it’s more on the gentleman principle between a seller and a customer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Imagine if I paid RM11.70 for the RM11.75 coffee and just simply said sorry and told you that I’m five sen short, how would you feel?” Fdaus wrote in the post
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cashier then proceeded to give him an additional 10 sen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following Fdaus’ post, ZUS Coffee chief operating officer Venon Tian apologised for the incident and released a detailed statement regarding the five sen fiasco on ZUS Coffee’s social media yesterday after conducting an immediate investigation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to the statement, on September 30, ZUS Coffee had acknowledged Fdaus’s post and had introduced a new 75 sen off voucher code for the inconveniences they caused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How many times you didn’t return the 5 sen to any customers? And yet you still had the audacity to mock us with the 75 sen token

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ukraine forces have liberated the small Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka settlements in the Kherson region as well, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ukraine's Interfax agency reported that according to Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesman for the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces, Ukraine's forces recaptured Torske, a small village in the Donetsk region, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) east of the now liberated Lyman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday that it was pulling troops out of the Lyman area "in connection with the creation of a threat of encirclement"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It did not mention Lyman in its daily update on fighting in Ukraine on Sunday, although it said Russian forces had destroyed seven artillery and missile depots in the Ukrainian regions of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Donetsk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zelenskiy said the abduction of the director-general of Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is an act of Russian terror
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Ukrainian military said in its evening statement on Sunday that its forces had repelled Russian advances in several areas - particularly in Donetsk region near Bakhmut and Spirne, just inside Donetsk region near Lysychansk, a major centre in neighbouring Luhansk region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russian forces had captured Lyman from Ukraine in May and had been using it as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia's largest battlefield loss since Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region in September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia had 5,000 to 5,500 troops in the town before the Ukrainian attack, a Ukrainian military spokesman said on Saturday

            <p>
                Zelenskiy said on Friday that peace talks with Russia while Putin was still president would be impossible

                The stinging setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin was delivered after he proclaimed the annexation of four regions covering nearly a fifth of Ukraine on Friday, an area that includes Lyman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday that it was pulling troops out of the Lyman area "in connection with the creation of a threat of encirclement"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It did not mention Lyman in its daily update on fighting in Ukraine on Sunday, although it said Russian forces had destroyed seven artillery and missile depots in the Ukrainian regions of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Donetsk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zelenskiy said the abduction of the director-general of Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is an act of Russian terror
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Ukrainian military said in its evening statement on Sunday that its forces had repelled Russian advances in several areas - particularly in Donetsk region near Bakhmut and Spirne, just inside Donetsk region near Lysychansk, a major centre in neighbouring Luhansk region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russian forces had captured Lyman from Ukraine in May and had been using it as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia's largest battlefield loss since Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region in September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia had 5,000 to 5,500 troops in the town before the Ukrainian attack, a Ukrainian military spokesman said on Saturday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zelenskiy said on Friday that peace talks with Russia while Putin was still president would be impossible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia," he said

                About Us Advertise MALANG, Oct 2 — At least 129 people died at an Indonesian football stadium riot in which thousands of angry home fans invaded the pitch and police responded with tear gas that triggered a stampede, authorities said Sunday

                Ismail Sabri, who is also an Umno vice-president, said he had reached a consensus as one of the top five of the leadership on Friday as there was a need to return the mandate to the people as soon as possible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We (Umno top five) have always stated that there is a need to hasten the general election as we want to return the mandate to the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will have the Umno top five meeting, the political bureau meeting and the supreme council meeting before we decide

                “If there is a good reason to hold the snap polls, we will agree to it – that has always been our stand

                “As for the date (of dissolution of Parliament), please wait

            <p>
                You have waited since last year, you can wait a little while more this year,” said Ismail Sabri
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 30, the Umno supreme council stated that the Prime Minister would be meeting the Yang di-Pertuan Agong soon to advise on the date for dissolving Parliament this year to pave the way for the next general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This came after months of insistence by Umno leaders led by party president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to hold snap polls, despite reasoning by those supporting Ismail Sabri that it would be unwise to hold the elections during the monsoon season due to floods
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan released a statement on Friday that the dissolution of Parliament must be made as soon as possible to allow the 15th General Election to be held by this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision made by the Umno supreme council, he said, was consistent with the party’s stand from the beginning to return the mandate to Malaysians after the fall of the Pakatan Harapan government in February 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Umno supreme council had also instructed the entire party machinery to finalise all electoral preparations

                And there were certainly questions to be asked of Klopp’s decisions both before and during the game, particularly given how Liverpool were tactically flummoxed throughout an opening half-hour in which Brighton sauntered between the Reds' lines with alarming frequency

            <p>
                With Andy Robertson injured, there was little option but to replace Kostas Tsimikas - has the Greek ever had a worse game for Liverpool? - with James Milner

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia should get a Nobel prize for city planning where the environment and destruction can go hand in hand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DBKL just needs to raise taxes by a swipe of the pen for all flood mitigation and preventive efforts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You see, the only suckers are the city residents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the government knows best - call elections when Malaysia is flooded so that they can remain in power despite the misery of the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What a democratic country, where the will of the people determines their government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some people call it corruption and abuse of power, but no, we are battle-hardened to turn corruption into a virtue for the sake of development and people's welfare
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now you see it, now you don't
            </p>

                FAA’s assessment covers CAAM’s role as an aviation regulator, and is not an assessment of Malaysian airlines or airports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are very pleased to share that today (yesterday), FAA has officially announced that Malaysia has regained Category 1 of the International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) rating, and for this extremely proud achievement, I applaud everyone at CAAM for their tireless effort and commitment to this success,” said Dr Wee, who kickstarted the transformation process in CAAM after he assumed the role of Transport Minister in March 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As part of the change, Dr Wee brought in Tan Sri Mohd Khairul Adib Abd Rahman, the former director-general of public service, to be CAAM chairman, and career pilot Datuk Capt Chester Voo, to be CEO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In November 2019, FAA announced that Malaysia was assigned a Category 2 rating under the IASA programme due to non-compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) safety standards after a reassessment of CAAM earlier that year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The FAA assessment in 2019 found that CAAM needs to address 58 findings, whereby CAAM was able to resolve 25 of them in a relatively short time, while 33 other findings took much longer to resolve,” said Dr Wee, who gave a press conference yesterday in Montreal, the headquarters of ICAO, where he is attending the ICAO general assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Capt Voo, who was among the delegation, expressed his gratitude to the ministry and the FAA for their support in CAAM’s reinstatement as a Category 1 regulator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There were 301 questions from the FAA audit that required 403 critical element responses, and I would like to express my gratitude to the FAA for its very instructive and very detailed efforts to achieve the best in safety for the civil aviation industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This has shown Malaysia is compliant and has now demonstrated that we have an effective safety oversight capability

            <p>
                On behalf of all of our team, I would like to commit to all that we will be facilitating an inclusive aviation industry with no compromise on safety,” said Capt Voo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among others, the Malaysian delegation included Khairul Adib, Transport Ministry’s secretary-general Datuk Isham Ishak, Malaysian Aviation Commission executive chairman Datuk Seri Saripuddin Kasim, Malaysia Aviation Group CEO Capt Izham Ismail, AirAsia Malaysia CEO Riad Asmat, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd managing director Datuk Iskandar Mizal Mahmood and Batik Air CEO Capt Mushafiz Mustafa Bakri
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s participation as an ICAO council member enables the country to contribute to the international civil aviation industry and provides an avenue to voice matters affecting national interest, while also raising the country’s standing at the global level

                About Us Advertise GEORGE TOWN, Oct 2 — Budget 2023 would have no legality if Parliament were to be dissolved before it could be approved as rumoured, constitutional lawyers explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Surendra explained that the same Bill could be tabled again in order for it to proceed to the second reading when debate could take place, or a new one submitted entirely
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either scenario could lead to significant delays in passing Budget 2023 as both would have to wait until the 15th Parliament is sworn in, which could be weeks or months after the general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tabling of Budget 2023 has been expedited by three weeks to October 7 this year, fuelling suspicion that this was to allow for a general election to be held almost immediately after
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These circumstances then fuelled rumours that the prime minister would advise the Yang di Pertuan Agong to dissolve Parliament immediately or shortly after the tabling of Budget 2023, reminiscent to events before the 1999 general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 1999, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who was the prime minister at the time, sought the dissolution of Parliament shortly after the tabling of Budget 2000 in November, and his finance minister was forced to table another one at the end of February 2000 or around three months later, after Barisan Nasional prevailed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former finance minister Lim Guan Eng said this would also be the case if Parliament were dissolved before Budget 2023 could be approved, which effectively meant the document would little more than a draft

                Genco Shipping (GNK) The first company we’ll look at is Genco Shipping, a bulk carrier in the global ocean shipping network
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company’s last declared dividend, paid out in August, was for 50 cents per common share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At its current rate, the dividend yields 16.5%, well ahead of the inflation rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Nolan’s view, Genco is a Buy with a target price of $20, implying a one-year upside potential of 65%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (To watch Nolan’s track record, click here) Nolan is hardly alone in his upbeat take on Genco

                (EGLE) The second stock dividend stock we'll look at is Eagle Bulk Shipping, another player in the drybulk carriage sector
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the current rate, the dividend annualizes to $8.80 and gives a yield of 21%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The dividend was last paid out in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is another company whose performance – and especially, dividend performance – have caught Nolan’s attention
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stock has an average price target of $72.40, which indicates ~76% upside potential from the trading price of $41.21

                Genco Shipping (GNK) The first company we’ll look at is Genco Shipping, a bulk carrier in the global ocean shipping network
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company’s last declared dividend, paid out in August, was for 50 cents per common share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At its current rate, the dividend yields 16.5%, well ahead of the inflation rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Nolan’s view, Genco is a Buy with a target price of $20, implying a one-year upside potential of 65%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (To watch Nolan’s track record, click here) Nolan is hardly alone in his upbeat take on Genco

            <p>
                (See GNK stock forecast on TipRanks) Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (EGLE) The second stock dividend stock we'll look at is Eagle Bulk Shipping, another player in the drybulk carriage sector
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the current rate, the dividend annualizes to $8.80 and gives a yield of 21%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The dividend was last paid out in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is another company whose performance – and especially, dividend performance – have caught Nolan’s attention
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stock has an average price target of $72.40, which indicates ~76% upside potential from the trading price of $41.21

                The interest rate on those loans could surge to 7.54% in the new year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So all those payments take away from your retirement income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While these credit card balances should be paid down quickly, you shouldn’t let them delay saving for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, consider lowering your mortgage payments to use those funds to pay down other high interest loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finally, auto loans are another area to pay off before retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of August 2022, the average car loan for a buyer with good credit was 7.88%, according to MyAutoloan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if you have bad credit, that soars up to 19.87%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s about as much as the interest rate on a credit card
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s more, you’ll have to take into consideration these payments for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If $400 goes into a car payment, and $300 to a credit card and more for student loans, suddenly you have far less cash on hand for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why not pay down your mortgage too? It’s not just lower interest rates, although with the average national mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed rate at about 6.5%, that is an advantage

                Yet with investor sentiment in the gutter and the Bank of England vowing to open the chequebook to prop up its bond market, could another equities bear-market rally be in the cards? Julian Emanuel says so

            <p>
                And it really goes back to this idea that after 25 years of quiescent inflation, we had a breakout in the readings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's now been over a year and obviously really feeding into the Fed's (US Federal Reserve) imperative to get inflation under control by going on this unprecedented degree of hiking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the kind of rapid acceleration and tightening that reverberates across the globe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The conduit has really been the strength in the dollar feeding into the UK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You've had a leadership change, the queen's passing, a new prime minister, a new government — just total huge challenges in a market that had already been showing strains, frankly, since the Brexit vote in 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So really, testing the outer bands of volatility across every asset that’s in the UK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because it was clear the policy mismatch between the new Truss government and Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and where the Bank of England felt it needs to go — needed to go, needs to go, and that's an open concept, which is why I keep changing tenses — is that it's really caused this instability that got some feeling as if there was this idea that the UK was about to become an emerging market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That type of volatility
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Basically from our point of view, these kinds of bear markets — and if you go back to the highs in January — they don't move in straight lines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The VIX has started spiking, you've seen investor sentiment that's really only as bad as it's ever been near the trough in 2009, and near the bottom of the first Gulf War bear market in 1990

                The VIX has started spiking, you've seen investor sentiment that's really only as bad as it's ever been near the trough in 2009, and near the bottom of the first Gulf War bear market in 1990

                Liverpool take on Brighton later today as the Premier League returns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For this one, I'm looking at what is to come
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That means no Henderson but he will play midweek too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool will need to go as strong as they can
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between them, there is no point hurrying back Konaté, so Van Dijk and Matip will get the nod again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the rush not to scapegoat Alexander-Arnold, many have inadvertently thrown Elliott under the bus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The newly-crowned Liverpool Player of the Month for September should not lose his place in midfield — Henderson can play in midweek
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alongside the youngster, Thiago and Fabinho will complete a strong trio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah is bound to play, and it would be good to get Núñez in the side if he is fit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In contrast, Salah scored a hat-trick and returned to Liverpool early so he is a must for me
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Diogo Jota is also in form and scored for Portugal while Darwin Núñez did the same for Uruguay in his last international game before returning to Liverpool, and so I would start the trio
            </p>

                Liverpool take on Brighton later today as the Premier League returns
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For this one, I'm looking at what is to come
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That means no Henderson but he will play midweek too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool will need to go as strong as they can
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between them, there is no point hurrying back Konaté, so Van Dijk and Matip will get the nod again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the rush not to scapegoat Alexander-Arnold, many have inadvertently thrown Elliott under the bus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The newly-crowned Liverpool Player of the Month for September should not lose his place in midfield — Henderson can play in midweek
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alongside the youngster, Thiago and Fabinho will complete a strong trio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah is bound to play, and it would be good to get Núñez in the side if he is fit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In contrast, Salah scored a hat-trick and returned to Liverpool early so he is a must for me
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Diogo Jota is also in form and scored for Portugal while Darwin Núñez did the same for Uruguay in his last international game before returning to Liverpool, and so I would start the trio
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                About Us Advertise     KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 1 ― The grade for primary school headmasters and senior assistants will be upgraded to the maximum DG54, announced Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move, he said, would benefit 2,047 education service officers nationwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said headmasters on Grade DG48 (personal to holder) also would no longer have to drop to senior assistants or ordinary teachers in primary schools once they have been promoted to Grades DG52 and DG54 on a time-based excellence basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This will upgrade the substantive grades for the posts of headmaster and senior assistant teacher, as well as enable those who have been promoted to a higher grade to remain in that position until Grade DG54,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister said the issue of the grade for headmasters in primary schools only limited to Grade DG48 and senior assistants to Grade 44 was among issues raised by NUTP to him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri said the Education Ministry was also studying the staffing structure of headmasters and senior assistants in primary schools through the proposed School Model with the setting of flexi grades up to DG54 to safeguard the position of school administrators, while maintaining harmony among the school staff
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from that, Grade DG48 officers in the education service (PPP) will also be given the opportunity to be appointed as senior assistants in primary schools, he said, adding that this meant that senior assistants in primary schools would not be limited to Grade DG44 only
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said senior assistants who had been promoted to a higher grade could also remain in that post until Grade DG54
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister also announced that the career path of Outstanding Teachers in primary schools will also be extended up to Grades DG52 and DG54 as 90.68 percent of primary school teachers were now graduate teachers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government, he said, was also making efforts to address various issues plaguing the country's education, such as school maintenance and security, allowance of senior assistants that need to be reviewed and the shortage of teachers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the government was also concerned about the issue of dilapidated schools in Sabah and Sarawak and it would be given serious attention in the 2023 Budget which will be tabled this Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister also called on parents to always cooperate with teachers and the school, who strived to ensure their children excel academically and also in co-curricular activities

                By Yasin Ebrahim                                Investing.com -- The Dow fell Friday, rounding off its worst quarterly losing streak since 2015 that has pushed stocks into bear-market territory as investors prepared for further Federal Reserve rate hikes to cool inflation that continues to run hot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7%, or 490 points, the Nasdaq was down 1.5%, and the S&P 500 fell 1.4%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All three major averages fell for the third straight quarter.  The personal consumption expenditure price index, the fed’s preferred inflation measure, showed that inflation rose more than expected in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This “compounds the pressure for the [Fed] to stay on course in its fight against inflation,” Stifel said in a note
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fed vice chair Lael Brainard on Friday cautioned against the central bank reversing course on monetary policy too early, saying monetary policy would need to be “restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target” After hiking rates by 3% in just six months, the fed continues to echo the need for further hikes, stoking worries among investors that the central bank could overshoot on tightening and push the economy into a deep recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The push higher in inflation, however, hasn’t yet had a material impact on the consumer, according to personal spending data Friday, to force a material change in consumer spending, suggesting a deep recession isn't on the horizon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We haven't seen that change [in consumer spending habits],” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management told Investing.com in an interview on Friday

                Fed vice chair Lael Brainard on Friday cautioned against the central bank reversing course on monetary policy too early, saying monetary policy would need to be “restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target” After hiking rates by 3% in just six months, the fed continues to echo the need for further hikes, stoking worries among investors that the central bank could overshoot on tightening and push the economy into a deep recession

            <p>
                The push higher in inflation, however, hasn’t yet had a material impact on the consumer, according to personal spending data Friday, to force a material change in consumer spending, suggesting a deep recession isn't on the horizon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We haven't seen that change [in consumer spending habits],” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management told Investing.com in an interview on Friday

                It was reported that a 38-year-old businessman was abducted in front of a restaurant in Pandan Indah by a group of men in a white Toyota Vellfire at 5.03pm on Thursday

            <p>
                However, the victim was later released and went straight to the Ampang Jaya police headquarters at about 10.45pm on Thursday, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was treated at Hospital Ampang

                The Kop will be sad to see him depart, though in reality at 31 years old, Liverpool will definitely be saying farewell to Firmino at the right time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, should Firmino, who made another 16 goal contributions last season and already six in eight games this season, depart next summer, Liverpool will have to find another player to maintain Jürgen Klopp's depth in attack
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And in order to find him, the Reds may have been given an ideal glimpse at a player who could be the perfect potential replacement for Firmino
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Flamengo's 25-year-old forward, Pedro, is regarded by many as one of the heirs to Firmino's throne in the national team, and it's easy to see why
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The forward has a similar work rate and is blessed with a technical ability that is on par with Firmino

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! This season, Pedro has already scored 24 goals for Flamengo in 53 games, but just like Firmino, his game doesn't solely rely on goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the most recent international break, Pedro showed a glimpse of his talent for the Brazilian national team, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That goal highlighted Pedro's ability to step up and play at a higher level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He may not just be an ideal heir to Firmino's throne at international level, but perhaps at Anfield, too.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 1 — What was initially thought to be a brazen kidnapping attempt outside a school in Ipoh, Perak, later turned out to be a hoax, and has spawned several other claims that have also been debunked by the police
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malay Mail examines what was claimed in the series of incidents, and the information that were later discovered
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The claim was made in a video showing a white panel van, which went viral shortly after it was posted online
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some of those resharing the video also claimed children were being abducted purportedly for organ harvesting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police also traced the white panel van shown in the video and found it to be a vehicle for worker transport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Skandaguru also said that the organ harvesting claims date back to 2017 and were being reshared in light of the incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The woman who made the claim then apologised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Johor police chief Datuk Kamarul Zaman Mamat said it was not of any kidnapping attempt, before noting the spike in claims resembling the Ipoh incident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “For example, it’s okay to say there may be kidnappers out there, keep an eye out for more news and information rather than saying things like ‘there are kidnappers here, be careful, protect your kids’, things like that

                No.8 bus in Bangkok, which is known for overtaking

            <p>
                Infamous in the Thai capital, the No.8 route has spawned parody songs, viral TikToks, horrified YouTube videos and even a feature-length Fast & Furious-style film

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The problem, according to Thai transport expert Sumet Ongkittikul, lies with the private firms that lease the route concession from the central Bangkok Mass Transit Authority
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Driver Aphisak supplements his daily wage of between 150 and 200 baht (RM18.50 and RM24.50) with 10% of the daily ticket sales
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have to complete the route at least four times a day for us to have enough money to live,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Passenger Sai Pin, 47, said she had seen a change since the transition to the new buses with a slightly higher fare of 15 baht (RM1.85)

                Premier League • England A pundit reckons David Moyes could take the surprise decision to drop Jarrod Bowen amid his struggles in the Premier League recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This helped West Ham finish seventh in the league and reach the last four of the Europa Conference League, where they lost to eventual winners Eintracht Frankfurt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bowen’s impressive campaign has also seen him become part of the England squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bowen hasn’t hit the ground running this term and is yet to score in the Prem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the West Ham ace has seen his form drop off, Rashford and Sancho are looking much better and could therefore get in the England World Cup squad ahead of him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “West Ham have been very successful and he [Bowen] has been a massive part of that success in winning football matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It’s been a slow start for West Ham this year and most of their players
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford has been in the squad many, many times and Sancho has been in the squad many, many times

            <p>
                He’s a very talented player but he hasn’t got his Premier League game going yet.” Bowen will certainly be looking to get among the goals when West Ham return to action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Antonio has proven he is able to lead the line effectively for West Ham, all while being the only striker at the club

                National Human Resources Association Malaysia (Pusma) president Zarina Ismail said that although the price cap imposed by the government is reasonable, some agencies may be charging extra for additional services they have to bear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Agencies are responsible for the maids they bring in and this responsibility lasts for the entire contract period or until the maid is sent back

            <p>
                She also noted the extra charges may also be due to the risks which some agencies are taking following the recent memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Malaysia and Indonesia for the sourcing of domestic helpers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Some agencies are taking a wait-and-see attitude and are not keen in sourcing Indonesian domestic helpers at the moment,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said Indonesian maids who are already in the country and who want to renew their contracts must now get an endorsement from an employment agency

                National Human Resources Association Malaysia (Pusma) president Zarina Ismail said that although the price cap imposed by the government is reasonable, some agencies may be charging extra for additional services they have to bear
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                She also noted the extra charges may also be due to the risks which some agencies are taking following the recent memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Malaysia and Indonesia for the sourcing of domestic helpers
            </p>

                She said Indonesian maids who are already in the country and who want to renew their contracts must now get an endorsement from an employment agency

                Borrowers with incomes of less than $125,000 (or $250,000 for a couple) can qualify for up to $10,000 in debt forgiveness on their federal direct student loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This includes at least some of the loans issued through the Federal Family Education Loan, Federal Perkins Loan and Health Education Assistance Loan programs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Initially, the administration said that qualified borrowers with these privately held loans could consolidate them into a federal direct loan and obtain debt relief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Thursday, however, the department's website said that to receive relief, borrowers had to have applied for a consolidation loan by Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some FFEL and Perkins loans are held by the Education Department, so they remain eligible for the blanket forgiveness if the borrowers meet the income limits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To find out whether your FFEL or Perkins loans could qualify for forgiveness, go to your account at the Federal Student Aid site (studentaid.gov) and call up the “My Loan Servicers” list
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the servicer’s name is preceded by “DEPT OF ED,” that loan is held by the federal government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More than 5 million of those loans are held by the Education Department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the remaining, privately held but federally guaranteed loans, only a portion of the borrowers would meet the income limits for blanket loan forgiveness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The change was reported on the same day that six Republican-controlled states sued to block the blanket debt forgiveness, arguing that the administration didn't have the authority to wipe out student loan balances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By cutting off the ability to qualify for forgiveness by consolidating privately held FFELs, Perkins loans and HEALs into a direct loan, the administration is reducing lenders' and servicing companies' loss of future earnings

                What you may have missed though, was the Oracle of Omaha’s fancy for farmland

                One of Gates’s biggest bets lately has been farmland

            <p>
                At that same shareholders’ meeting alluded to previously, the example Buffett gave as the anti-Bitcoin was farmland

                for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I’ll write you a check this afternoon,” Buffett said during the meeting

                That’s bad news if you’re looking to buy a house for yourself but great news if you’re looking for property as an investment

                If you are able to purchase a property outright and on your own, that may be the best option

                But it’s not just Gates or Buffett — even Goldman Sachs sees an opportunity with farmland

                At that same shareholders’ meeting alluded to previously, the example Buffett gave as the anti-Bitcoin was farmland

                for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I’ll write you a check this afternoon,” Buffett said during the meeting

                (Bloomberg) -- One of Apple Inc.’s most senior executives is leaving after he turned up in a viral video on TikTok making an off-color joke that he fondles “big-breasted women” for a living
            </p>
            
            <p>
                5, Apple’s Tony Blevins was approached by TikTok and Instagram creator Daniel Mac as part of a series where he asks owners of expensive cars their occupations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also touted that he has a “hell of a dental plan.” In reality, Blevins is Apple’s vice president of procurement and is in charge of striking deals with suppliers and partners
            </p>

                An Apple spokesman said Thursday that Blevins is departing the Cupertino, California-based company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Blevins has been part of a roughly 100-person group of vice presidents at Apple and one of only about 30 executives that report to either Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook or Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Williams has been Blevins’s boss for much of his career, though he briefly reported to Sabih Khan, Apple’s senior vice president of operations, according to the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Williams’s decision for the company and Blevins to part ways, one of the people said
            </p>

            <p>
                The bill, called the Combating Financial Conflicts of Interest in Government Act, is an attempt to limit conflict of interest for public office holders and their families when it comes to their investments

                It happened soon before the Senate was expected to vote on a bipartisan bill that would see domestic chipmakers get a $52 billion subsidy

            <p>
                This was up 22% from the previous quarter, and the highest single dividend that Devon has ever paid

            <p>
                This was down from the 72 cents reported in the year-ago quarter, but still solidly profitable – and more than enough to cover the 19.5 cent per common share dividend payment

                Still, inflation picked up last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3% last month after dipping 0.1% in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the 12 months through August, the PCE price index increased 6.2% after advancing 6.4% in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index jumped 0.6% after being unchanged in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The so-called core PCE price index climbed 4.9% on a year-on-year basis in August after increasing 4.7% in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed tracks the PCE price indexes for its 2% inflation target
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The consumer price index increased 8.3% year-on-year in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed raised its median forecast for core PCE inflation to 4.5% this year from its previous estimate of 4.3% in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Inflation adjusted consumer spending barely rose in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That suggests consumer spending could be tepid this quarter after helping to blunt the drag on gross domestic product from a slow down in the pace of inventory accumulation in the second quarter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The economy contracted at a 0.6% annualized rate last quarter after shrinking at a 1.6% pace in the January-March quarter

                Still, inflation picked up last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3% last month after dipping 0.1% in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the 12 months through August, the PCE price index increased 6.2% after advancing 6.4% in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index jumped 0.6% after being unchanged in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The so-called core PCE price index climbed 4.9% on a year-on-year basis in August after increasing 4.7% in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed tracks the PCE price indexes for its 2% inflation target
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The consumer price index increased 8.3% year-on-year in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed raised its median forecast for core PCE inflation to 4.5% this year from its previous estimate of 4.3% in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Inflation adjusted consumer spending barely rose in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That suggests consumer spending could be tepid this quarter after helping to blunt the drag on gross domestic product from a slow down in the pace of inventory accumulation in the second quarter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The economy contracted at a 0.6% annualized rate last quarter after shrinking at a 1.6% pace in the January-March quarter

                The company had a net income of $1.33 billion, an increase of $700 million year-over-year, or 90%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the second quarter of 2022, ET had a DCF of $1.88 billion, up a solid $500 million from the year-ago quarter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the source of the company’s dividend, so the increase is important

                ET set its most recent dividend, for the second quarter of the year, paid out in August at 23 cents per common share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This yield matches the current rate of inflation; investors can use this dividend to provide a stronger level of protection against the effects of price inflation

                The stock has a trading price of $10.97 and an average price target of $15.20, implying a one-year upside of ~39%

                Proceeds from these properties generated Q2 revenues of $70.5 million, for a 44% year-over-year increase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These results meant that IIPR’s dividend is affordable – and in fact, management raised the dividend payment in the most recent declaration

            <p>
                The World Bank has warned that simultaneous global rate hikes in response to inflation could trigger a recession in 2023

                — Photo by Claudio Schwarz on Unsplash A Utah man has been charged with six counts of attempted sexual exploitation after being accused of using his son’s Instagram to ask for nude photos from minors

            <p>
                The 39-year-old man’s ex-wife contacted the Brigham City Police Department to report that he had been using her son’s phone to message female teenagers, according to an incident report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The son left his phone at his father’s home

            <p>
                The man sent a text to a juvenile on May 8, saying, “Your sexy as hell, send send me the sexiest picture you got,” according to the report

            <p>

            <p>
                90min report that Liverpool scouts were already ‘familiar’ with Adel before Salah’s recommendation, though

            <p>
                But should Liverpool make a move, Adel would have to be loaned out

            <p>
                As he wouldn’t be able to come into the first team straight away on account of work permit issues, Adel would be a signing for the future

            <p>
                At twenty-one, he’s already broken into the Egyptian national team

                As far as comparisons go, it would feel lazy to lump him into the Salah bracket

            <p>
                In that respect, perhaps a move to Liverpool wouldn’t do Adel much good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because he wouldn’t be able to play straight away, this may make it difficult for him to live up to that tag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The figures involved make it no gamble at all for Liverpool

                If he develops as Salah did, he’ll make a fine player

            <p>
                If not, Liverpool could still earn a good fee from him as they did with the likes of Taiwo Awoniyi, who never played for the club during a six-year spell

                Ripple (XRP) is undoubtedly a top-performing coin for this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The token is up 9% in the last 7 days and 33% in a month

            <p>
                It staged a 100% price hike this week – higher than XRP’s 9% weekly gain

                Unlike XRP, Binance Coin (BNB) gets a sluggish price forecast not from exhaustion but from lack of momentum

                Ripple (XRP) is undoubtedly a top-performing coin for this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The token is up 9% in the last 7 days and 33% in a month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It staged a 100% price hike this week – higher than XRP’s 9% weekly gain

            <p>
                Unlike XRP, Binance Coin (BNB) gets a sluggish price forecast not from exhaustion but from lack of momentum

                “When I checked the car around 7am today, I was shocked to see red paint all over,” he said when Perak MCA public services and complaints bureau chief Low Guo Nan visited the place Friday (Sept 30)

                Educator Felicia Chen, 27, said that with the strong US currency, she would be able to increase the usual amount of money she sends back home by at least 10%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With the same amount of US dollars, I am able to increase my savings and the money I send back home by at least 10% to 12%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, I do send some money back on a quarterly basis to pay some bills,” she said, adding that she usually sent home an average of between US$200 (RM913.50) and US$400 (RM1,827) per month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                May Lee, 56, said the high exchange rate was timely as she had to pay for her mother’s healthcare expenses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “My mother, who is in her 80s, had a bad fall last month and we are planning to put her in a nursing home to get better care
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “My children aged 21 and 23 are still studying here and I have to pay their fees (in the United States), so I might have to stretch my money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With the high exchange rate, it will make it easier for me to pay for these expenses,” she added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A healthy body breeds a healthy mind, and students need a healthy body, healthy mind and well-being to thrive and study well,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the brighter side, Dr Chooi said students could see the high conversion rate as an opportunity to learn how to be smart consumers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Now is the best time to learn how to cook and make simple, nourishing meals at home during the weekends,” she said.

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, Sept 30 ― At a ceremony denounced by Ukraine as a “Kremlin freak show”, Russian President Vladimir Putin will proclaim the annexation of four Ukrainian regions today, escalating his seven-month war and taking it into an unpredictable new phase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin will preside over a treaty-signing on “the entry of new territories into the Russian Federation”, three days after the completion of hastily staged referendums in which Moscow's proxies in the occupied regions claimed majorities of up to 99 per cent in favour of joining Russia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But despite the triumphal setting, the annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions comes at a perilous moment for Putin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After months of grinding, attritional warfare, Ukraine seized the initiative this month by routing Russian forces in the northeastern Kharkiv region

            <p>
                Even staunch Kremlin allies have criticised the chaotic nature of the call-up, and Putin himself said on Thursday that “all mistakes must be corrected”

            <p>
                Nuclear threat While it holds the vast majority of Luhansk and Kherson regions, Russia controls only about 60 per cent of Donetsk and 70 per cent of Zaporizhzhia, where fighting has raged close to Europe's biggest nuclear plant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hurried annexations mean front lines will now run through territory that Russia is declaring as its own, and which Putin has said he is ready to defend with nuclear weapons if necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Western politicians called that a bluff ― something Putin explicitly denied

            <p>
                The United States says it has warned Russia of catastrophic consequences if it did use a nuclear weapon

            <p>
                One of the most common ways to create this income is to buy yourself an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Essentially, an annuity is an insurance contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will generally be a minimum payment that guarantees you don't lose your principal, but it's possible that the money won't grow at all, which is not a concern with a fixed annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of this is determined when you buy your annuity contact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That percentage only ticks up to 95.9% if you use an annuity, not enough of a difference to justify using an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Social Security Bridge – Another Option Morningstar also details an alternative plan for making sure you have enough money in retirement without having to buy an annuity, a strategy known as the Social Security Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you turn 70, you file for Social Security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you start taking these payments, you can reduce the amount of money you take out of your retirement accounts each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Morningstar analysis, though, shows that if you have at least 36 times your needed annual income saved at the time of retirement, you likely don't need to get an annuity

                But that’s not what Kiyosaki is doing right now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here’s a look at what Kiyosaki prefers instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Precious metals — particularly gold and silver — have been a popular hedge against inflation and uncertainties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The price of gold is actually down about 9% in 2022, while silver has fallen by nearly 20%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think $15,000 is not out of the question for gold,” Kiyosaki says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While there are many ways to gain exposure to gold and silver, he prefers to just buy the metal directly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this year, he tweeted that he only wants “real gold or silver coins” and not the ETFs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I buy gold and silver for one reason, because if push comes to shove, I can spend it anywhere in the world,” he tells Kitco
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some say that bitcoin is the new gold
            </p>

                But that’s not what Kiyosaki is doing right now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here’s a look at what Kiyosaki prefers instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Precious metals — particularly gold and silver — have been a popular hedge against inflation and uncertainties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The price of gold is actually down about 9% in 2022, while silver has fallen by nearly 20%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think $15,000 is not out of the question for gold,” Kiyosaki says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While there are many ways to gain exposure to gold and silver, he prefers to just buy the metal directly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this year, he tweeted that he only wants “real gold or silver coins” and not the ETFs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I buy gold and silver for one reason, because if push comes to shove, I can spend it anywhere in the world,” he tells Kitco
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some say that bitcoin is the new gold
            </p>

                According to legendary investor Jim Rogers, there is hope on the horizon — but perhaps not for long

            <p>
                “Now it looks like inflation and pessimism is breaking, but just remember, this is probably the last rally.” The 79-year-old investor knows a thing or two about making money in turbulent times

                It has all happened before.” The lesson here, as Rogers explains, is that “usually towards the end, stocks go crazy.” One of the surest signs of inflation is the rally in commodity prices we saw earlier this year

            <p>
                He created the Rogers International Commodity Index in 1998

                The fund that tracks the index — Elements Rogers International Commodity Index-Total Return ETN (RJI) — is up 12% year to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, gold has the same function, but Rogers actually favors the grey metal for now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Silver is down something like 70 or 80% from its all-time high and gold is 15% below its all-time high,” he says

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 29 — Heirs of a late South-east Asian sultan today asked a Dutch court for permission to seize Malaysian assets in the Netherlands, their lawyer said, seeking enforcement of a US$15 billion (RM70 billion) arbitration award granted to them against Malaysia’s government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s government, which has said it does not recognise the heirs’ claim, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Dutch petition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A French arbitration court in February ordered Malaysia to pay the US$15 billion sum — the second largest arbitration award on record — to the descendents of the last Sultan of Sulu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia obtained a stay on the ruling pending an appeal, but the award remains enforceable outside France under a United Nations treaty on international arbitration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The heirs of the sultan, who once controlled a territory spanning rainforest-covered islands in the southern Philippines and parts of Borneo island, asked the Dutch court to recognise and enforce the arbitration award
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The heirs wish to take “recourse against assets of Malaysia, which are located in the Netherlands”, according to a copy of the court petition shared by their lawyer

            <p>
                Reuters was unable to immediately verify the filing with Dutch court authorities
            </p>

                Thursday, 29 Sep 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ASP Salwani Mohd Hadzir, 40 told the Magistrate's Court here that even though she was informed the case involved Lew, she had no idea it was pertaining to sexual harassment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I was only informed by the investigating officer DSP Noor Ashikin Shamsuri that the case involved Ebit Lew," she told counsel Ram Singh during cross-examination at the preacher’s sexual harassment trial on Thursday (Sept 29)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Salwani said she had typed in Section 509 of the Penal Code on a set of three photographs of the handphone and SIM card that she seized from Mohd Fairuz Abu on Oct 5, 2021 at his house in Alor Setar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salwani, the Staff Officer of the Kedah Police Contingent Headquarters Criminal Investigation Department’s Women and Children Section, agreed with the defence counsel that when she seized the handphone from Mohd Fairuz, she knew it contained relevant matters with regards to a Tenom case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salwani testified further that said she had read news articles on the accused via social media before she went to Mohd Fairuz's house to seize his handphone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During re-examination, the police officer said she did not inspect the contents of the seized phone as each case material is required to be sent to the Royal Malaysian Police Forensics Department for analysis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On labeling the set of photographs of the seized handphone and SIM card with Section 509 of the Penal Code, Salwani said she typed it out when delivering the seized items to the investigating officer at Bukit Aman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked by Deputy Public Prosecutor Nor Azizah Mohamad why Section 509 was typed out, the witness said it was because the investigation being carried out involved that section
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He told the court that the complainant in the case was among several sexual harassment victims to whom his NGO had extended assistance
            </p>

                Thursday, 29 Sep 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ASP Salwani Mohd Hadzir, 40 told the Magistrate's Court here that even though she was informed the case involved Lew, she had no idea it was pertaining to sexual harassment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I was only informed by the investigating officer DSP Noor Ashikin Shamsuri that the case involved Ebit Lew," she told counsel Ram Singh during cross-examination at the preacher’s sexual harassment trial on Thursday (Sept 29)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Salwani said she had typed in Section 509 of the Penal Code on a set of three photographs of the handphone and SIM card that she seized from Mohd Fairuz Abu on Oct 5, 2021 at his house in Alor Setar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salwani, the Staff Officer of the Kedah Police Contingent Headquarters Criminal Investigation Department’s Women and Children Section, agreed with the defence counsel that when she seized the handphone from Mohd Fairuz, she knew it contained relevant matters with regards to a Tenom case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salwani testified further that said she had read news articles on the accused via social media before she went to Mohd Fairuz's house to seize his handphone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During re-examination, the police officer said she did not inspect the contents of the seized phone as each case material is required to be sent to the Royal Malaysian Police Forensics Department for analysis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On labeling the set of photographs of the seized handphone and SIM card with Section 509 of the Penal Code, Salwani said she typed it out when delivering the seized items to the investigating officer at Bukit Aman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked by Deputy Public Prosecutor Nor Azizah Mohamad why Section 509 was typed out, the witness said it was because the investigation being carried out involved that section
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He told the court that the complainant in the case was among several sexual harassment victims to whom his NGO had extended assistance
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Wan Aizuddin showed this purported letter during Najib's trial over the misappropriation of RM2.28 billion of 1Malaysia Development Berhad's (1MDB) funds, as part of the defence's attempt to show that the millions of US dollars which had entered Najib's personal bank account in the past had allegedly originated from gifts from Saudi royalty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The contents of the purported letter to Najib that was read out also included the remark that Najib will have absolute discretion to decide how to use the gift and that the gift was merely a "token gesture" by the purported Saudi prince
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The November 2011 letter shown by Wan Aizuddin in court today was virtually identical in wording to a February 1, 2011 letter from the same purported figure who had promised to give US$100 million as a gift to Najib, with the difference mostly being only the date and the amount and details on how the money would allegedly be given
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The November 2011 letter carried the same disclaimer that the gift of millions of US dollars to Najib should not be seen as an act of corruption
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Aizuddin tried to suggest that six transactions of money that flowed into Najib's personal AmIslamic account ending 9694 from November 2011 to November 2012 would all be covered under the purported promised gift of US$375 million from the alleged Saudi prince
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Aizuddin then suggested that mathematically, the total sum of the six transactions would not exceed the US$375 million amount, with Yap then agreeing to this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Wan Aizuddin also tried to suggest that the purported promised gift of US$100 million would explain the inflow of two transactions of US$10 million each from Prince Faisal to Najib's account on February 24, 2011 (equivalent to RM30,449,929.97) and June 14, 2011 (equivalent to RM 30,179,909.46)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Wan Aizuddin also suggested that those two transactions of US$10 million in February and June 2011, and a US$49,999,988 from the Ministry of Finance Riyadh on August 18, 2011 would all be covered by the letter for the purported "personal gift or donation" of US$100 million, but Yap said he would not know as he does not deal directly with the client and that the best person to check with on this would be Yu who was the relationship manager at the bank handling Najib's accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yap today said that before he carried out the conversions of US dollar into ringgit Malaysia for the two US$10 million transactions in 2011, he had already known that the AmPrivate Banking-MR account is Najib's account as Yu had informed him of this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yap said the reason that he was told of the account holder's identity as being Najib was to enable him to correctly capture the transaction into the bank's system and also because it was a "sensitive" bank account "so that we don't easily talk too much about the transaction"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's lawyers had since yesterday been trying to show that money which came into Najib's account are instead linked to the purported gifts from the Saudi royal family

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The action comes after bailiffs acting for the Sulu Sultan seized Petronas Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz) Sàrl and Petronas South Caucasus Sàrl in Luxembourg, both of which belong to Petronas, to satisfy a US$14.92 billion (RM66.4 billion in mid-July) award by the Spanish arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa

            <p>
                To recap, the legal dispute erupted after the eight heirs of the late Sulu Sultan initiated international arbitration proceedings against the government of Malaysia in end-January 2018 in Madrid, based on an 1878 agreement between Sultan Mohamet Jamal Al Alam (the Sultan of Sulu then) and Baron de Overbeck and Alfred Dent, which granted perpetual sovereign rights over what is parts of Sabah today, in return for an annual RM5,300 token payment

            <p>
                Malaysia claims the militants are linked to the Sultan of Sulu, but the heirs dispute this claim.  Petronas’ 51% unit shipping company MISC Bhd also has several companies in the Netherlands, which hold some of its assets

                (Bloomberg) -- Porsche AG is set for a bullish trading debut after parent Volkswagen AG set the final listing price for the sports-car maker at the upper limit, seeking to defy deep market upheaval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Porsche is a mature, well-known business that doesn’t need to raise capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s listing is set to be the largest in Europe since miner Glencore Plc raised almost $10 billion in a London IPO in 2011, the data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The share price puts Porsche at a valuation that’s not far from VW’s total market capitalization -- a business that comprises Audi, Skoda, Seat, and the VW brand, among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen divided Porsche’s share capital into equal parts voting and non-voting shares, with the German carmaker retaining 75% ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rowe Price and ADQ have together committed to take up as much as 3.7 billion euros of the IPO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other 12.5% of total shares up for grabs is going directly to VW’s largest shareholders –- the billionaire Porsche and Piech family –- via their investment company Porsche Automobil Holding SE
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family already owns a 53% majority of VW’s voting shares, and under the IPO terms, they will also get 25% plus 1 share of Porsche AG’s voting stock, paying a small premium to preferred shares for a total of 10.1 billion euros
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche is targeting revenue of as much as 39 billion euros this year and return on sales of as much as 18%, up two percentage points from last year, the company said in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s Luxury IPO Pitch Meets Investor Concern Over Valuation Besides the byzantine ownership structure, governance is another issue for some investors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to an analysis from Bernstein, Porsche’s market capitalization should sit at 80 billion euros – just below luxury companies but at the higher end of carmakers

                (Bloomberg) -- Porsche AG is set for a bullish trading debut after parent Volkswagen AG set the final listing price for the sports-car maker at the upper limit, seeking to defy deep market upheaval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Porsche is a mature, well-known business that doesn’t need to raise capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s listing is set to be the largest in Europe since miner Glencore Plc raised almost $10 billion in a London IPO in 2011, the data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The share price puts Porsche at a valuation that’s not far from VW’s total market capitalization -- a business that comprises Audi, Skoda, Seat, and the VW brand, among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen divided Porsche’s share capital into equal parts voting and non-voting shares, with the German carmaker retaining 75% ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rowe Price and ADQ have together committed to take up as much as 3.7 billion euros of the IPO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other 12.5% of total shares up for grabs is going directly to VW’s largest shareholders –- the billionaire Porsche and Piech family –- via their investment company Porsche Automobil Holding SE
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family already owns a 53% majority of VW’s voting shares, and under the IPO terms, they will also get 25% plus 1 share of Porsche AG’s voting stock, paying a small premium to preferred shares for a total of 10.1 billion euros
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche is targeting revenue of as much as 39 billion euros this year and return on sales of as much as 18%, up two percentage points from last year, the company said in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s Luxury IPO Pitch Meets Investor Concern Over Valuation Besides the byzantine ownership structure, governance is another issue for some investors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to an analysis from Bernstein, Porsche’s market capitalization should sit at 80 billion euros – just below luxury companies but at the higher end of carmakers
            </p>

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Sept 29 — A one-month jail imposed by the High Court on Datuk Lokman Noor Adam for contempt of court is insufficient and should be increased to protect the dignity of the administration of justice, the Court of Appeal heard today

            <p>
                On July 15, the Kuala Lumpur High Court sentenced Lokman to a one-month jail after finding him guilty of contempt of court for intimidating a witness in former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness was Najib’s former special officer Datuk Amhari Efendi Nazaruddin, the key witness in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The contemnor further quoted some of the evidence presented in court and manipulated it in the police report to paint the picture that Najib was victimised by Amhari Efendi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A police report lodged by my client against the witness cannot be subject to contempt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How can this be intimidation?” the lawyer said in Lokman’s appeal against his conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lokman also lost his two appeals in the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court to overturn the High Court’s ruling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas had initiated the committal proceeding against Lokman to seek an order for Lokman to be committed to prison or be fined for his action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Thomas, on September 25, 2019, Lokman uttered words in a video interview that constituted an express or implied threat against Amhari Efendi for having given evidence in the former prime minister’s trial at the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas said that on the same day, Lokman lodged a police report against Amhari Efendi in respect of the evidence given by him at the trial

                How can this be intimidation?” the lawyer said in Lokman’s appeal against his conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lokman also lost his two appeals in the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court to overturn the High Court’s ruling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas had initiated the committal proceeding against Lokman to seek an order for Lokman to be committed to prison or be fined for his action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Thomas, on September 25, 2019, Lokman uttered words in a video interview that constituted an express or implied threat against Amhari Efendi for having given evidence in the former prime minister’s trial at the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas said that on the same day, Lokman lodged a police report against Amhari Efendi in respect of the evidence given by him at the trial

                On July 15, the Kuala Lumpur High Court sentenced Lokman to a month's jail after finding him guilty of contempt of court for intimidating a witness in former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak's 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) trial

                (Bloomberg) -- Porsche AG is set for a bullish trading debut after parent Volkswagen AG set the final listing price for the sports-car maker at the upper limit, seeking to defy deep market upheaval
            </p>

                “Porsche is a mature, well-known business that doesn’t need to raise capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s listing is set to be the largest in Europe since miner Glencore Plc raised almost $10 billion in a London IPO in 2011, the data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The share price puts Porsche at a valuation that’s not far from VW’s total market capitalization -- a business that comprises Audi, Skoda, Seat, and the VW brand, among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen divided Porsche’s share capital into equal parts voting and non-voting shares, with the German carmaker retaining 75% ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rowe Price and ADQ have together committed to take up as much as 3.7 billion euros of the IPO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other 12.5% of total shares up for grabs is going directly to VW’s largest shareholders –- the billionaire Porsche and Piech family –- via their investment company Porsche Automobil Holding SE
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family already owns a 53% majority of VW’s voting shares, and under the IPO terms, they will also get 25% plus 1 share of Porsche AG’s voting stock, paying a small premium to preferred shares for a total of 10.1 billion euros
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche is targeting revenue of as much as 39 billion euros this year and return on sales of as much as 18%, up two percentage points from last year, the company said in July

            <p>
                According to an analysis from Bernstein, Porsche’s market capitalization should sit at 80 billion euros – just below luxury companies but at the higher end of carmakers

            <p>
                (Bloomberg) -- Porsche AG is set for a bullish trading debut after parent Volkswagen AG set the final listing price for the sports-car maker at the upper limit, seeking to defy deep market upheaval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Porsche is a mature, well-known business that doesn’t need to raise capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s listing is set to be the largest in Europe since miner Glencore Plc raised almost $10 billion in a London IPO in 2011, the data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The share price puts Porsche at a valuation that’s not far from VW’s total market capitalization -- a business that comprises Audi, Skoda, Seat, and the VW brand, among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen divided Porsche’s share capital into equal parts voting and non-voting shares, with the German carmaker retaining 75% ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rowe Price and ADQ have together committed to take up as much as 3.7 billion euros of the IPO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other 12.5% of total shares up for grabs is going directly to VW’s largest shareholders –- the billionaire Porsche and Piech family –- via their investment company Porsche Automobil Holding SE
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family already owns a 53% majority of VW’s voting shares, and under the IPO terms, they will also get 25% plus 1 share of Porsche AG’s voting stock, paying a small premium to preferred shares for a total of 10.1 billion euros
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche is targeting revenue of as much as 39 billion euros this year and return on sales of as much as 18%, up two percentage points from last year, the company said in July
            </p>

                Porsche’s Luxury IPO Pitch Meets Investor Concern Over Valuation Besides the byzantine ownership structure, governance is another issue for some investors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to an analysis from Bernstein, Porsche’s market capitalization should sit at 80 billion euros – just below luxury companies but at the higher end of carmakers

            <p>
                The move, one of the legal steps Russia says will lead to formal annexation of 15% of Ukraine's territory, confirms that Putin is doubling down on his war against Ukraine despite suffering a major military reversal this month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The annexation, after what Kyiv and Western countries say were phoney referendums staged at gunpoint on Russian-held Ukrainian territory, has been rejected in the West as an illegal seizure of land captured in war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Washington and the European Union are set to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the plan, and even some of Russia's close traditional allies, such as Serbia and Kazakhstan, say they will not recognise the annexation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin's annexation ceremony will be held in one of the Kremlin's grandest halls with the pro-Russian figures Moscow considers to be leaders of the four Ukrainian regions -- Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After days of speculation over exactly how Russia would mark the annexation, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed some details of the ceremony on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin would deliver a major speech on the subject, he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He did so at a similar event in 2014 after Russia proclaimed it had annexed Ukraine's Crimea region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin publicly backed the annexation plans in a speech last week in which he also announced the call-up of hundreds of thousands of Russian reservists, and warned he could use nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory if necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's Defence Ministry said a day earlier that a Ukrainian offensive on Lyman had failed, with 70 Ukrainian soldiers killed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                NUCLEAR UMBRELLA Russian government officials have said that the four regions will fall under Moscow's nuclear umbrella once they have been formally incorporated into Russia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia had already shut Nord Stream 1, worsening an energy crisis in Europe

                Moscow's planned annexation of 15% of Ukraine's territory, after what Kyiv and Western countries say were phoney referendums staged at gunpoint in Russian-occupied areas, shows Putin doubling down on his war despite suffering a major reversal on the battlefield this month and discontent at home over a widely criticised partial military mobilisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin said that "all mistakes" made in a call-up to reinforce Russia's military operation in Ukraine should be corrected, his first public acknowledgment that the "partial mobilisation" he announced last week had not gone smoothly

                A tribune has already been set up on the Moscow square with giant video screens and billboards proclaiming "Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson - Russia!"

                In a report published Tuesday, the ratings agency projected that euro zone growth will stall in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023, with growth for the year only reaching 0.3%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                is already in the midst of a "moderate four-quarter recession that started in the second quarter," as households face inflation running at 9.9% and expected to rise further over the winter, quashing consumer spending over the coming quarters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Fiscal support measures deployed by the government, notably the upper limit set on typical household energy bills ("Energy Price Guarantee"), will significantly protect household budgets from an even greater inflation squeeze over the winter," S&P Regional Credit Conditions Chair Paul Watters said in the report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This, along with ongoing resilience of the labor market, are the main reasons we do not expect the U.K
            </p>
            
            <p>
                economy to perform worse." However, Watters noted that inflationary pressures are not confined to retail energy prices, and the plunging pound will further drive up the price of imported goods while domestic price pressures remain elevated, with core inflation — excluding volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices — still above 6%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The suite of policy measures included tax cuts and energy subsidies to households and businesses estimated to cost a minimum 9% of GDP through 2026, and the Bank of England responded by reiterating its commitment to further monetary policy tightening in order to rein in sky-high inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The concern for the gilts market is that nearly all of that 6% of GDP [the emergency energy support] will be funded via new debt, during a period when the BOE is shrinking its balance sheet, and sterling depreciation is adding to inflationary pressures," the S&P report added

                In a report published Tuesday, the ratings agency projected that euro zone growth will stall in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023, with growth for the year only reaching 0.3%

                is already in the midst of a "moderate four-quarter recession that started in the second quarter," as households face inflation running at 9.9% and expected to rise further over the winter, quashing consumer spending over the coming quarters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Fiscal support measures deployed by the government, notably the upper limit set on typical household energy bills ("Energy Price Guarantee"), will significantly protect household budgets from an even greater inflation squeeze over the winter," S&P Regional Credit Conditions Chair Paul Watters said in the report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This, along with ongoing resilience of the labor market, are the main reasons we do not expect the U.K

            <p>
                economy to perform worse." However, Watters noted that inflationary pressures are not confined to retail energy prices, and the plunging pound will further drive up the price of imported goods while domestic price pressures remain elevated, with core inflation — excluding volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices — still above 6%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The suite of policy measures included tax cuts and energy subsidies to households and businesses estimated to cost a minimum 9% of GDP through 2026, and the Bank of England responded by reiterating its commitment to further monetary policy tightening in order to rein in sky-high inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The concern for the gilts market is that nearly all of that 6% of GDP [the emergency energy support] will be funded via new debt, during a period when the BOE is shrinking its balance sheet, and sterling depreciation is adding to inflationary pressures," the S&P report added

            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, voting for Bersatu or PAS is not going to solve the problem of kleptocracy in Malaysia

                By Indradip Ghosh BENGALURU (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve will hike its key interest rate to a much higher peak than predicted two weeks ago and the risks are skewed towards an even higher terminal rate, according to economists polled by Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But that is unlikely to push the Fed to switch its policy path anytime soon as Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers have remained blunt about the "pain" to come
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, over 70% of economists, 59 of 83, predicted the central bank would hike its fed funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight meeting in November, a Reuters poll taken after the Fed meeting last week showed

                Creating reliable streams of retirement income is one of the most important elements of a person’s financial plan

            <p>
                Fidelity Investments plans to launch a new product next year that will allow individuals to shift a portion of their employer-sponsored retirement plan into an annuity

            <p>
                The offering, called Guaranteed Income Direct, will enable participants of 401(k) and 403(b) plans to convert their retirement savings into a guaranteed stream of retirement income akin to pension payouts

            <p>
                Plan participants will have the ability to convert any amount of retirement savings into an annuity that will function like a “personal pension,” the company said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any money that is not converted into an annuity can remain in the workplace savings plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This proliferation of annuities within retirement plans is a byproduct of the SECURE Act, the comprehensive retirement legislation signed into law in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fidelity Investments will roll out its own annuity option in 2022 that will allow participants of 401(k)s and 403(b)s to convert their retirement savings into guaranteed streams of lifetime income

                Creating reliable streams of retirement income is one of the most important elements of a person’s financial plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fidelity Investments plans to launch a new product next year that will allow individuals to shift a portion of their employer-sponsored retirement plan into an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The offering, called Guaranteed Income Direct, will enable participants of 401(k) and 403(b) plans to convert their retirement savings into a guaranteed stream of retirement income akin to pension payouts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you determine whether an annuity is an appropriate investment option for you
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Plan participants will have the ability to convert any amount of retirement savings into an annuity that will function like a “personal pension,” the company said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any money that is not converted into an annuity can remain in the workplace savings plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This proliferation of annuities within retirement plans is a byproduct of the SECURE Act, the comprehensive retirement legislation signed into law in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fidelity Investments will roll out its own annuity option in 2022 that will allow participants of 401(k)s and 403(b)s to convert their retirement savings into guaranteed streams of lifetime income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you determine whether they should be part of your plan for retirement
            </p>

                Tips for Managing Your Retirement Savings Are you saving enough? Experts say your expenses in retirement will be about 80% of what they were prior to retiring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can be a trusted partner as you plan for retirement, helping you determine what your needs will be and how to meet them

                The alarm in Malaysia has now rung loud and clear after a 23-year-old Malaysian citizen named Goi Zhen Feng became Malaysia’s first recorded death from overseas job scams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goi, a teacher in training, was supposedly held in Myawaddy, Myanmar, which borders Mae Sot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But who runs these syndicates? What do they want and how do they lure thousands of people to fall straight into their trap? How many people are actually being held captive overseas and what is the government’s stand on the issue? Let Malay Mail break it down for you
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A victim who was named as Eric reportedly said he was brought to a rural place in Cambodia and was given a mobile phone to work for a telephone scam company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How many Malaysians have fallen victim to these scams? Officially, the police’s secretary Datuk Noorsiah Mohd Saaduddin said on August 19 that a total of 238 Malaysians have fallen victim to overseas job scam syndicates between 2021 and then, with 168 in the clutches of these gangs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Special Functions) Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad also told the press on September 20 that an exact number of victims could not be ascertained as only about half of the cases have been reported to the police, making authorities unable to put an exact number of Malaysian victims who have fallen into the syndicate’s trap
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On each floor there were about 300 people, mostly Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The victim named Eric also shared that he was kept at a 13-storey building resembling a hotel and there were 10 groups consisting of 10 people or more for each group at each floor of the building
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goi’s death was the push needed for Putrajaya to put this matter on the top of their list, after a memorandum was sent to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to seek the government’s assistance and intervention in the job scam issue abroad with Malaysians as the victims were sent in by a group of NGOs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then instructed Dr Abdul Latiff to take charge of the matter, and on September 20, the special functions minister said that he would bring up the job scam issue involving Malaysian victims abroad to Cabinet after chairing a meeting with Goi’s family and the NGOs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On September 27, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Abdullah chaired a coordination meeting with government agencies to refine, frame, monitor and implement action concerning job scam syndicate cases involving Malaysian citizens abroad

                Goi’s death was the push needed for Putrajaya to put this matter on the top of their list, after a memorandum was sent to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to seek the government’s assistance and intervention in the job scam issue abroad with Malaysians as the victims were sent in by a group of NGOs

                The letter said the gift was in appreciation of Najib’s new ideas as a modern Islamic leader and also in view of the friendship the two had developed over the years

            <p>
                Najib’s counsel Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed read out the letter, said to be signed by the prince on Feb 1, 2011

                Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the decision, the latest in Malaysia’s continued relaxation of Covid-19 rules, took into consideration the country’s improving Covid-19 situation as well as better aircraft practices and technology

                Acting on The Star’s tip-off, a team of enforcers from the Health Ministry raided the beautician’s hair salon in Setapak yesterday and confiscated dental probes, dental fillings and nickel-titanium wire that is commonly used for braces
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health Ministry dental officer Dr Taufik Firdaus – who acted as the lead raiding officer – said a preliminary investigation found that the beautician, who denied having any helper, was not registered with the Malaysian Dental Council
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The small cockroach-infested premises that she was operating from was also found to be unregistered

            <p>
                that the premises has been providing illegal dental treatments, hence we conducted our investigation before the raid

                Section 4(1) states that no person shall establish, maintain, operate or provide a private medical clinic or private dental clinic unless it is registered under Section 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the 36-year-old beautician, who remained calm during the operation, claimed that she acquired her skills from an Indonesian woman who also provided a one-day course
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It cost me about RM3,600 for a day course

            <p>
                Also, many are doing it (providing veneer services) so I tried it myself just so that I could earn money as a single mother

            <p>
                “I know it is wrong, but many are doing it, so what’s the issue if I want to look for pocket money?” she said, adding that she was doing it as a part-time job

                Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming of Universiti Malaya said life expectancy was an indication of how long on average people can expect to live if the age-specific mortality rates of that year remained constant for the remainder of their lives
            </p>
            
            <p>

                She was commenting on Malaysia’s average life expectancy at birth which has gone down from 74.4 years in 2012 to 73.4 years in 2022 due to the increase in the number of excess deaths during the pandemic
            </p>

                Among Asean countries in 2021, Malaysia now has a lower life expectancy than Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and Vietnam

            <p>
                In a recent statement, the Department of Statistics Malaysia said the reduction in life expectancy was found among men and women for Malaysians and non-Malaysians in the country

                The statistics of life expectancy in this country have been recording a drop since 2020, partly contributed by the excess deaths during the pandemic.Based on the statistics, Malaysian women are expected to live longer than men, with a difference of 4.5 years in 2022

                CRISTIANO RONALDO'S sister Katia Aveiro has leapt to his defence after he was slammed by Portugal fans following the 1-0 loss to Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Katia rejected the backlash and accused the fans of being cruel and ungrateful while claiming Ronaldo receives little support and is still the "best player in the world"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will always be by his side, no matter what
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Portuguese spit on the plate they eat [from], it has always been that way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It is necessary to give a hand to those who have always given theirs to Portugal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Portuguese are sick, petty, soulless, stupid, ungrateful and forever ungrateful
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This guy who's sitting, he's on his knees… There's no one to give him a hand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The one sitting is called Cristiano Ronaldo and he is just the best player in the world." Katia was in attendance at the Braga Municpial Stadium supporting Ronaldo alongside his Spanish girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo even played through the pain barrier after sustaining a cut on his nose and a black eye in Portugal's previous game against the Czech Republic

                CRISTIANO RONALDO'S sister Katia Aveiro has leapt to his defence after he was slammed by Portugal fans following the 1-0 loss to Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Katia rejected the backlash and accused the fans of being cruel and ungrateful while claiming Ronaldo receives little support and is still the "best player in the world"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will always be by his side, no matter what
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Portuguese spit on the plate they eat [from], it has always been that way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It is necessary to give a hand to those who have always given theirs to Portugal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Portuguese are sick, petty, soulless, stupid, ungrateful and forever ungrateful
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This guy who's sitting, he's on his knees… There's no one to give him a hand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The one sitting is called Cristiano Ronaldo and he is just the best player in the world." Katia was in attendance at the Braga Municpial Stadium supporting Ronaldo alongside his Spanish girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo even played through the pain barrier after sustaining a cut on his nose and a black eye in Portugal's previous game against the Czech Republic

                SFA officers were on June 8 alerted by ICA to luggage that was found to contain assorted meat products at Changi Airport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chinese national Wang Liansheng, 68, was fined $17,500 on Thursday for illegally importing assorted meat products into Singapore, said the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On June 8, SFA officers were alerted by ICA to luggage that was found to contain assorted meat products at Changi Airport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The eight pieces of luggage, which belonged to Wang, contained 226kg of frozen meat products such as chicken, beef, pork, mutton and rabbit meat from China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In another case, Singaporean Tan Kay Huat, 74, was fined $2,000 on Thursday for illegally importing fresh vegetables for sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                SFA said its officers had on March 22 inspected a Malaysian lorry carrying food produce consigned to Tan and Chng Vegetable Seeds and Enterprise at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                SFA said food imports must meet its requirements, fruits and vegetables can be imported only by licensed importers, and every consignment must be declared and accompanied by a valid import permit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The long-term ingestion of excessive pesticide residues through the consumption of vegetables that have been subjected to pesticide abuse could lead to adverse health effects." SFA added that meat products can be imported only from accredited sources in approved countries that comply with Singapore's food safety standards and requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Offenders who import meat products illegally from unapproved sources can be fined $50,000, jailed for up to two years, or both

                Apple Suppliers Drop as Firm Said to Ditch IPhone Output Boost Apple had upgraded its sales projections in the weeks leading up to the iPhone 14 release and some of its suppliers had started making preparations for a 7% boost in orders

                China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, is in an economic slump that’s hit its domestic mobile device makers and also affected the iPhone’s sales

            <p>
                The smartphone market is expected to shrink by 6.5% this year to 1.27 billion units, according to data from market tracker IDC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The supply constraints pulling down on the market since last year have eased and the industry has shifted to a demand-constrained market,” said Nabila Popal, research director at IDC

                Liverpool forward Diogo Jota was far better than Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo for Portugal last night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s according to Goal, who claim that the Liverpool man was ‘full of enterprise’ throughout the 1-0 loss to Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Starting on the left of Portugal’s forward line, Jota is said to have been his team’s ‘most potent attacking threat.’ One ball in particular for Ronaldo is described as being ‘scintillating’ but the United man couldn’t capitalise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regardless of the Ronaldo stuff, this is really great to hear from a Liverpool point of view

            <p>
                Given a surprise start by Jurgen Klopp against Ajax, Jota was a constant threat as Liverpool won 2-1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although he wasn’t able to find the net last night, it sounds as though that wasn’t for a lack of quality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the fixture list now chock full until the World Cup in Novemeber, Liverpool need Jota badly

            <p>
                Former Manchester United chief Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made some bold decisions in the transfer market before he was sacked last year, and Erik ten Hag is now reaping the rewards Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag oversaw a record transfer spree at Old Trafford this summer, but the Dutchman could have had plenty more work on his hands were it not for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag splashed out more than £231million to bring in six new faces following his arrival from Ajax earlier this year - the most Manchester United have ever spent in a single transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Solskjaer decided against offloading five United stars who were tipped for the exit last summer; Donny van de Beek, Diogo Dalot, Anthony Elanga, Anthony Martial and Edinson Cavani
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And although that quintet failed to make much of an impression last term, the majority are now firmly in Ten Hag's plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are even suggestions that Dalot is in line for a new contract after impressing Ten Hag - who would have been forced to rely on Wan-Bissaka had Solskjaer not blocked the Portuguese defender's exit last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elanga has continued to progress under Ten Hag after his breakthrough year under Rangnick last term and has now established himself as a legitimate member of the first-team squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Solskjaer's decision to hang onto Van De Beek could still benefit Ten Hag, who quickly identified midfield as an area of the squad in need of improvement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Had Van De Beek been allowed to depart, then the new United chief would have been even lighter on midfield options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Van De Beek flourished under Ten Hag's guidance during his time at Ajax, where he initially caught the Man United hierarchy's eye
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And there is every chance that the 25-year-old could still force his way back into the first-team frame at Old Trafford in the coming weeks with his old boss at the helm - even if Ten Hag's arrival has failed to spark an instant improvement in the playmaker's fortunes

            <p>
                Former Manchester United chief Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made some bold decisions in the transfer market before he was sacked last year, and Erik ten Hag is now reaping the rewards Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag oversaw a record transfer spree at Old Trafford this summer, but the Dutchman could have had plenty more work on his hands were it not for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag splashed out more than £231million to bring in six new faces following his arrival from Ajax earlier this year - the most Manchester United have ever spent in a single transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Solskjaer decided against offloading five United stars who were tipped for the exit last summer; Donny van de Beek, Diogo Dalot, Anthony Elanga, Anthony Martial and Edinson Cavani
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And although that quintet failed to make much of an impression last term, the majority are now firmly in Ten Hag's plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are even suggestions that Dalot is in line for a new contract after impressing Ten Hag - who would have been forced to rely on Wan-Bissaka had Solskjaer not blocked the Portuguese defender's exit last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elanga has continued to progress under Ten Hag after his breakthrough year under Rangnick last term and has now established himself as a legitimate member of the first-team squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Solskjaer's decision to hang onto Van De Beek could still benefit Ten Hag, who quickly identified midfield as an area of the squad in need of improvement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Had Van De Beek been allowed to depart, then the new United chief would have been even lighter on midfield options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Van De Beek flourished under Ten Hag's guidance during his time at Ajax, where he initially caught the Man United hierarchy's eye
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And there is every chance that the 25-year-old could still force his way back into the first-team frame at Old Trafford in the coming weeks with his old boss at the helm - even if Ten Hag's arrival has failed to spark an instant improvement in the playmaker's fortunes

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 28 — In a growing wave of protest, more and more people have joined in the call to stop the Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022’s Generational End Game (GEG)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The GEG mandates against the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products to those born from the year 2007 onwards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the biggest issue — even among anti-smokers — is GEG’s impact on the consumer’s legal right to choose
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the State does limit these abilities through an age prerequisite, it acts as a temporary gatekeeper as opposed to the Bill’s permanent prohibition with the GEG.” Datuk Seri Panglima Wilfred Madius Tangau, the Tuaran MP and a member of the Parliamentary Special Select Committee (PSSC) responsible for reviewing the GEG, highlighted his concerns in a series of tweets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said, “As a member of the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022, I have raised the constitutionality of the Bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Will the Bill survive a constitutional legal challenge from those born in 2007? “The question is should a constitutional legal challenge be initiated especially by those born in 2007 and after, and if they (are successful) to get the court to declare that the Bill is unconstitutional then the drafting and tabling of the Bill will be a waste of time.” The tweet seems to point to the fact that the PSSC is divided over the controversial GEG proposal

            <p>
                In a poll conducted by a local think-tank, 86 per cent of the over 150 retailers surveyed said that the GEG “would add complexity to their business.” What is more, they believe the GEG will not stop smoking as these young people will either resort to illegal cigarettes (89 per cent), get someone “legitimate” to purchase cigarettes for them (70 per cent), or perhaps turn to other dangerous substances such as drugs (34 per cent)

                They urged the government to address concerns related to the GEG, which they said can impact their livelihood

                (Bloomberg) -- As crazy as it sounds, all the turmoil that’s ripped through Wall Street over the past week has still left debt markets in Corporate America relatively unscathed

            <p>
                While greater than before the Federal Reserve’s latest jumbo rate hike, risk premiums for investment-grade debt remain modest compared to recent market stresses -- and the intensifying mayhem across bond and currency markets

                warns of a potential repricing of corporate bonds that risks adding fresh fuel to the stock rout, as current earnings estimates attach an “unjustifiably high probability” that the US economy will avoid a severe recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile junk-risk premiums are hovering around 520 basis points, below July’s high-water mark
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the UK, 30-year gilts surged above 5% on Tuesday for the first time since 2002, raising fears of an incipient crisis of confidence in a developed-debt market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To be sure, corporate default rates are still very relatively low
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All that suggests the market is still attributing “an unjustifiably high probability to a soft landing, leaving room for downward revisions in upcoming months,” wrote Goldman strategist Sienna Mori in a note
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Slower earnings growth coupled with a higher cost of capital will hurt the weakest companies, especially in the high-yield market, per Goldman, while Barclays Plc strategists anticipate that a wave of downgrades is barreling toward the US blue-chip bond market
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                warns of a potential repricing of corporate bonds that risks adding fresh fuel to the stock rout, as current earnings estimates attach an “unjustifiably high probability” that the US economy will avoid a severe recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile junk-risk premiums are hovering around 520 basis points, below July’s high-water mark
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the UK, 30-year gilts surged above 5% on Tuesday for the first time since 2002, raising fears of an incipient crisis of confidence in a developed-debt market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To be sure, corporate default rates are still very relatively low
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All that suggests the market is still attributing “an unjustifiably high probability to a soft landing, leaving room for downward revisions in upcoming months,” wrote Goldman strategist Sienna Mori in a note
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Slower earnings growth coupled with a higher cost of capital will hurt the weakest companies, especially in the high-yield market, per Goldman, while Barclays Plc strategists anticipate that a wave of downgrades is barreling toward the US blue-chip bond market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, the market isn’t yet seeing a wave of bankruptcies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But should the profit picture darken, buckle up for fresh market fireworks potentially, according to Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade

                By Indradip Ghosh BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will hike its key interest rate to a much higher peak than predicted two weeks ago and the risks are skewed towards an even higher terminal rate, according to economists polled by Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But that is unlikely to push the Fed to switch its policy path anytime soon as Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers have remained blunt about the "pain" to come
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, over 70% of economists, 59 of 83, predicted the central bank would hike its fed funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight meeting in November, a Reuters poll taken after the Fed meeting last week showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The forecasts are in line with the Fed's dot-plot projection and current market pricing

            <p>
                "The short-run pain of recession would be better than the long-run pain of inflation expectations becoming unanchored." Also, unlike most major central banks, the Fed has backing from a strong currency and a relatively strong economy compared with its peers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among economists who had a view through end-2023, only 46% forecast at least one rate cut
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With inflation not seen below the central bank's target anytime soon and the unemployment rate, currently 3.7%, expected to increase at a much slower pace than in previous recessions, a premature cut might hurt the Fed's credibility

            <p>
                More than 80% of respondents said once the fed funds rate reaches a peak, the central bank was more likely to leave it unchanged for an extended period rather than cut it quickly

                According to Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) statistics, civil servants in their 40s and below constituted 57.8 per cent of the 5,652 people arrested for graft between 2007 and August 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Under Act 575, convicted offenders face a jail term of not less than 14 days and not more than 20 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the record, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (MACC Act or Act 694) provides for a maximum jail term of 20 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since the minimum term is not specified in the Act, it is left to the judge’s discretion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also pointed out that the same modality cannot be used for the execution of punishment for people convicted of corruption and those charged with stealing something from a supermarket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This, she said, is because people involved in corruption come from various backgrounds and include people of high standing in society and institutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “(Hence) severe punishment should be meted out to those convicted of corruption to make them repent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It will also reflect the seriousness of the government in fighting corruption as well as serve as a lesson to the people not to get caught up in the immoral activity,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Commenting on this, Amini Amir said it is this materialistic attitude that’s compelling young people to be corrupt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They should, by right, know that they can be charged under Section 25 of the MACC Act 2009 for failing to report corrupt activities (in their organisation)
            </p>

                According to Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) statistics, civil servants in their 40s and below constituted 57.8 per cent of the 5,652 people arrested for graft between 2007 and August 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Under Act 575, convicted offenders face a jail term of not less than 14 days and not more than 20 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the record, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (MACC Act or Act 694) provides for a maximum jail term of 20 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since the minimum term is not specified in the Act, it is left to the judge’s discretion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also pointed out that the same modality cannot be used for the execution of punishment for people convicted of corruption and those charged with stealing something from a supermarket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This, she said, is because people involved in corruption come from various backgrounds and include people of high standing in society and institutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “(Hence) severe punishment should be meted out to those convicted of corruption to make them repent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It will also reflect the seriousness of the government in fighting corruption as well as serve as a lesson to the people not to get caught up in the immoral activity,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Commenting on this, Amini Amir said it is this materialistic attitude that’s compelling young people to be corrupt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They should, by right, know that they can be charged under Section 25 of the MACC Act 2009 for failing to report corrupt activities (in their organisation)

                Liverpool should reconsider an old transfer target, with Chelsea having apparently set a discount £31m price tag for an archetypal Jürgen Klopp player

            <p>

            <p>
                In essence, he is much the same player as the one Liverpool fans were eager to sign four years ago, but now with far more experience at the top level

            <p>
                Pulisic has spent more time on the right, but as a right-footer he would be in a different mould to Klopp’s typical inverted winger approach

            <p>
                In this respect, too, it could be a case of the right player at the wrong time

            <p>
                Nevertheless, as a flexible option on either side of the attack, Pulisic ticks the majority of boxes for Liverpool — including price, if the £31m transfer fee is to be believed

                “When I mentioned that it was related to Ebit Lew, the woman shared with me screenshots of her conversation with him, as well as pornographic images (of genitals) sent by him to her via WhatsApp,” he told magistrate Nur Asyraf Zolhani in response to questions from deputy public prosecutor Zahida Zakaria

                "We did not stop negotiating with the players despite the decision to ban, but we were delaying entering the final stage of the negotiations until the ban was lifted.” Ronaldo, 37, looked on course to quit United in the summer after the club failed to qualify for the Champions League with just 12 months left on his Old Trafford contract

                According to data from the IRS, Americans in the most common income bracket earned an adjusted gross income between $50,000 and $75,000 in 2017 and paid an average income tax of $5,077
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Benzinga hasn’t seen Trump’s tax returns and cannot verify the facts reported by the Times
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real estate offers some unique tax advantages, mainly the ability to write off depreciation against income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s common for a real estate investor to show a loss on their income tax return while receiving positive cash flow for the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fractional real estate investors also receive similar benefits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another likely reason for Trump’s low tax bills is the use of a tax loss carryforward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was able to carry those losses over each year until 2005
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Individual real estate investors use Trump’s tax strategy every year, which is one reason real estate is such a popular asset class
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Individuals who take part in a crowdfunded offering will receive a K-1 tax document each year, which shows the investor’s share of net income or loss after deducting expenses like depreciation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fractional investment platforms like Arrived Homes simplify the tax preparation process by sending out a single 1099-DIV tax form each January
            </p>

                According to data from the IRS, Americans in the most common income bracket earned an adjusted gross income between $50,000 and $75,000 in 2017 and paid an average income tax of $5,077

            <p>
                Benzinga hasn’t seen Trump’s tax returns and cannot verify the facts reported by the Times
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real estate offers some unique tax advantages, mainly the ability to write off depreciation against income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s common for a real estate investor to show a loss on their income tax return while receiving positive cash flow for the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fractional real estate investors also receive similar benefits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another likely reason for Trump’s low tax bills is the use of a tax loss carryforward

            <p>
                He was able to carry those losses over each year until 2005
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Individual real estate investors use Trump’s tax strategy every year, which is one reason real estate is such a popular asset class
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Individuals who take part in a crowdfunded offering will receive a K-1 tax document each year, which shows the investor’s share of net income or loss after deducting expenses like depreciation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fractional investment platforms like Arrived Homes simplify the tax preparation process by sending out a single 1099-DIV tax form each January

            <p>
                In a Facebook post, the Umno president said the government’s implementation of 16 from among the NRC’s recommendations already demonstrated that its views were taken seriously

                Every year the Social Security Board of Trustees releases an update on the financial status of the Social Security trust funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is important to strengthen Social Security for future generations,” Kilolo Kijakazi, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a statement when the report was released
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Millennials already have low expectations for the role Social Security will play in their retirement plans," CEO Ron Mastrogiovanni said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If policymakers take no action, Social Security could still pay 80% of benefits using its tax income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Increasing Social Security’s tax revenues, she says, should address the shortfall and restore solvency as the population ages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Social Security helps replace earnings during retirement, but it’s not meant to cover all your expenses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the average worker, Social Security replaces about 40% of annual savings before retirement, according to the SSA — though that figure varies depending on income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average Social Security retirement benefit in August 2022 was $1,627 per month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s less than $20,000 per year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you start collecting your Social Security benefits early, you’ll have less to work with
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, the loss of future Social Security benefits can be offset with a “consistent and modest annual increase” in savings, according to the HealthView Services report

                Every year the Social Security Board of Trustees releases an update on the financial status of the Social Security trust funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is important to strengthen Social Security for future generations,” Kilolo Kijakazi, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a statement when the report was released
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Millennials already have low expectations for the role Social Security will play in their retirement plans," CEO Ron Mastrogiovanni said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If policymakers take no action, Social Security could still pay 80% of benefits using its tax income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Increasing Social Security’s tax revenues, she says, should address the shortfall and restore solvency as the population ages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Social Security helps replace earnings during retirement, but it’s not meant to cover all your expenses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the average worker, Social Security replaces about 40% of annual savings before retirement, according to the SSA — though that figure varies depending on income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average Social Security retirement benefit in August 2022 was $1,627 per month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s less than $20,000 per year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you start collecting your Social Security benefits early, you’ll have less to work with
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, the loss of future Social Security benefits can be offset with a “consistent and modest annual increase” in savings, according to the HealthView Services report
            </p>

                Last month, Lantronix reported its fourth and final quarterly results for its fiscal year 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The headline number was a quarterly top line of $35.9 million, a gain of 74% year-over-year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While this EPS came in just under the 9-cent forecast, it was up 33% from the 6-cent result reported in the year-ago quarter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the full fiscal year 2022, Lantronix reported $129.5 million in total revenues, up 81% from the $71.3 million reported in fiscal 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Looking forward, the company is guiding toward $149 million to $162 million in revenues for fiscal 2023; at the midpoint, this would represent a 20% increase from the ’22 total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The shares are trading for $4.74 and their $12.20 average target suggests ~163% upside in the next 12 months (See Lantronix stock forecast on TipRanks) Universal Display Corporation (OLED) The second stock we’ll look at is Universal Display, a leader in the market for organic light emitting diodes, or OLEDs

            <p>
                They can also be found in lighting systems – and give Universal Display a neat stock ticker into the bargain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Business has been slowing globally, which suppressed demand for Universal Display’s OLED products, and have put near-term weakness on the company’s prospects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the company reported a 5.4% year-over-year gain in revenues, from $129.7 million in the year-ago quarter to $136.6 million in 2Q22, the figure missed expectations by $14.61 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In-line with this upbeat outlook, Searle gives OLED shares a Buy rating and a price target of $208 for the year ahead, implying an upside of 114% for the coming year

                At his company Icahn Enterprises, the net asset value went up about 30% in the first six months of this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Icahn provided two names
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Icahn’s pick in the energy space is CVR Energy (CVI), which is mainly in the refinery business
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He says that the stock “is quite cheap, even though it’s come up a lot.” CVR Energy shares have surged 50% year to date and 74% over the last 12 months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Q2 of 2022, CVR Energy brought in $3.1 billion of net sales, up from $1.8 billion in the year-ago period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the two entities are related — CVR Energy subsidiaries own 37% of the common units of CVR Partners — CVR Partners is also publicly traded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “[The] fertilizer business, to me, is a great business today,” Icahn says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Q2, the partnership’s average realized gate price for UAN shot up 134% year over year to $555 per ton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For ammonia, the average realized gate price rose 193% year over year to $1,182 per ton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unsurprisingly, CVR Partners has been another stellar performer in this ugly market as the stock is up 29% year to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s easy to see why the business is appealing to Icahn

                Icahn provided two names
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Icahn’s pick in the energy space is CVR Energy (CVI), which is mainly in the refinery business
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He says that the stock “is quite cheap, even though it’s come up a lot.” CVR Energy shares have surged 50% year to date and 74% over the last 12 months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Q2 of 2022, CVR Energy brought in $3.1 billion of net sales, up from $1.8 billion in the year-ago period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the two entities are related — CVR Energy subsidiaries own 37% of the common units of CVR Partners — CVR Partners is also publicly traded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “[The] fertilizer business, to me, is a great business today,” Icahn says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Q2, the partnership’s average realized gate price for UAN shot up 134% year over year to $555 per ton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For ammonia, the average realized gate price rose 193% year over year to $1,182 per ton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unsurprisingly, CVR Partners has been another stellar performer in this ugly market as the stock is up 29% year to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s easy to see why the business is appealing to Icahn
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                Asked by Najib’s lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed if it was normal for a person or a company which has a bank account to appoint a mandate holder, Uma Devi said this would be only in limited situations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “For individual account, no
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uma Devi agreed that a bank branch officer would usually be in charge of contacting the account holder to ask for the confirmation of cheques
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in situations where there is a relationship manager at the bank directly in charge of handling the accounts — such as for Najib’s bank accounts, Uma Devi said the bank branch would then contact the relationship manager to ask the latter to confirm the cheques with the account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked by Wan Aizuddin if there would be any breach of banking rules if the relationship manager fails to contact the account holder for cheque confirmation and simply says the bank customer had confirmed the cheques, Uma Devi said there would be a breach but with the bank only knowing if the customer complains
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Yes, if there’s a dispute by the customer, there would be
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uma Devi then said bank customers should have checked the transactions in the statement of their bank accounts, describing it as a “duty”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the bank, we don’t take that for granted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So customers will check their account,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uma Devi confirmed she had never seen a remittance amount from a personal bank account larger than this US$620 million sum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wedani had previously also confirmed an August 21, 2013 letter from Najib to AmIslamic Bank’s Jalan Raja Chulan branch manager, instructing for money to be transferred out from his 9694 account to Tanore’s bank account, and that a sum of over US$620 million was sent from the 9694 account on August 26, 2013 to the Tanore account

                Asked by Najib’s lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed if it was normal for a person or a company which has a bank account to appoint a mandate holder, Uma Devi said this would be only in limited situations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “For individual account, no
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uma Devi agreed that a bank branch officer would usually be in charge of contacting the account holder to ask for the confirmation of cheques
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in situations where there is a relationship manager at the bank directly in charge of handling the accounts — such as for Najib’s bank accounts, Uma Devi said the bank branch would then contact the relationship manager to ask the latter to confirm the cheques with the account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked by Wan Aizuddin if there would be any breach of banking rules if the relationship manager fails to contact the account holder for cheque confirmation and simply says the bank customer had confirmed the cheques, Uma Devi said there would be a breach but with the bank only knowing if the customer complains
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Yes, if there’s a dispute by the customer, there would be
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uma Devi then said bank customers should have checked the transactions in the statement of their bank accounts, describing it as a “duty”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the bank, we don’t take that for granted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So customers will check their account,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uma Devi confirmed she had never seen a remittance amount from a personal bank account larger than this US$620 million sum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wedani had previously also confirmed an August 21, 2013 letter from Najib to AmIslamic Bank’s Jalan Raja Chulan branch manager, instructing for money to be transferred out from his 9694 account to Tanore’s bank account, and that a sum of over US$620 million was sent from the 9694 account on August 26, 2013 to the Tanore account

            <p>
                "When I mentioned that it was related to Ebit Lew, the woman shared with me screenshots of Ebit Lew's conversation with her, as well as pornographic images (of genitals) sent by Ebit via WhatsApp," he said in front of Magistrate Nur Asyraf Zolhani in response to questions from Deputy Public Prosecutor Zahida Zakaria
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Fairuz said he also sent the screenshots shared by the woman to a man named Firdaus Wong, who he said was handling a similar case involving the accused with another woman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When Zahida asked Mohd Fairuz what action he took after sending the screenshots to Wong, the witness said that on July 27, 2021, he contacted the woman via a phone call to listen to the full chronology of events with regard to the harassment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ebit Lew is a big personality

            </p>
            
            <p>
                After he made the suggestion, Mohd Fairuz said the woman asked for some time to discuss it with her husband, and that she finally lodged a police report on Aug 7, 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Fairuz said he had personally met with the woman and was able to identify her in court
            </p>

                The witness also recognised Lew, who was sitting on the witness stand

                He noted that Bank Negara’s press release, which was issued last week on the ringgit, is a testament that the central bank will ensure the domestic foreign exchange market will continue to function orderly, and domestic liquidity remains ample to support the economy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is important now for the country to continue enhancing its economic and financial resilience, including implementing key reforms to strengthen the fundamental support for and longer term confidence on the ringgit, Lee pointed out

            <p>
                Meanwhile, estimates among analysts vary but on a more optimistic note, stated that global inflation could start ebbing from as early as the end of this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The potential easing in inflation will strengthen the case for global central banks such as the Fed and the European Central Bank to slow down their rate hikes, although the risk is that rate hikes will still continue in the near term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will also then reduce the pressure on Bank Negara to raise interest rates

                “Nevertheless, the current combination of high inflation and slow economic growth raises the risk of a stagflationary episode,” Kenanga Research said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, underlying price pressures as measured by core inflation continued to trend higher, highlighting that inflation may continue to remain high and would not return to the 2% inflation target anytime soon, despite global central banks’ aggressive rate hikes,” the research house added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Lee said inflation back home may moderate from 2023 due to the projected slower economic growth and domestic demand as well as the high base effect
            </p>

                Britain’s currency is in trouble—and things could still get a lot worse for sterling, experts warn
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The British pound crashed to an all-time low below $1.05 during early trade on Monday, before recouping some of its losses to trade around $1.07
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Britain’s ailing currency, which had already fallen to a 37-year low earlier this month, continued its downward slide on Friday after newly appointed Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled the country’s biggest package of tax cuts in half a century
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pound's plunge deepened further after Kwarteng doubled down on the tax cuts, telling the BBC Sunday that there was “more to come”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                government’s tax policies, economics and policy experts have been warning that the historically strong pound could have much further to fall

            <p>
                is behaving a bit like an emerging market, turning itself into a submerging market,” he said

            <p>
                “It would not surprise me if the pound eventually gets below a dollar if the current policy path is maintained,” he warned

                Describing the issuance of the LOS as 'a first of its kind’ and ‘was done in great speed’, Datuk Siti Zauyah Mohd Desa, 63, said in her 25 years’ experience in the ministry, that was the first time an LOS was issued by the ministry without conducting a due diligence for the project cash flow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There was no current assessment on the joint-venture investment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In fact, there was none, nothing for us to do due diligence,” she said during re-examination by senior deputy public prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram in former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s trial for misappropriation of RM2.3bil in funds from1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US$3bil loan was approved by the government via a support letter signed by Najib, who was Finance Minister back in 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 26th prosecution witness said the projection of cash flow was one of the most important parts in the issuance of LOS for the ministry to assess whether any investment was able to churn out the right kind of income to service the loan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked by Sri Ram why she did not approach Najib herself to air her concerns over the issues surrounding the sovereign wealth fund, Siti Zauyah said she did not have direct access to the then prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "However, I did approach (then) Finance Minister II (Datuk Seri Ahmad Husni Mohamad Hanadzlah) but he did not want to get involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The senior DPP also questioned her about her previous testimony, where the witness said she was instructed by former Treasury secretary-general Tan Sri Dr Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah to continue processing the LOS despite lacking the usual process of conducting due diligence

                Its existence has been made known last month but it is only today that Perodua has officially launched a new version of its highly popular Ativa SUV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Simply called the Ativa Hybrid, it is essentially a Daihatsu Rocky e-Smart Hybrid that was launched in Japan last November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In fact, the model is imported directly from Japan albeit with Perodua and Ativa logos on it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, the Ativa Hybrid is being brought here not to boost Ativa’s sales but more as a test subject for Perodua’s long-term study on mobility as a service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, that is why the Ativa Hybrid is being offered only through a subscription service

            <p>
                The standard Ativa is already part of the EZ MOBi subscription service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On top of that, Perodua is also studying the driving behaviours of hybrid vehicles in Klang Valley, Penang, and Johor Bharu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the Ativa Hybrid itself, it runs on what Perodua described as a series hybrid system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without opening the hood, you can also spot the Ativa Hybrid by its grille and bumper designs which are slightly different from the standard Ativa
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, there is no variant label on its bonnet door alongside the Ativa badge

            <p>
                Unlike the standard Ativa which can be obtained in up to five different colourways depending on specific variants, the Ativa Hybrid is only available in Pearl White

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 27 — The prosecution today rested its case after calling a total of 29 out of 37 witnesses to testify in court against former youth and sports minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman who is accused of misappropriating more than RM1 million as well as criminal breach of trust (CBT)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witnesses, ranging from Syed Saddiq’s parents and star prosecution witness Rafiq Hakim Razali — who is the former Angkatan Bersatu Anak Muda (Armada) assistant treasurer — to MACC officers and members of Syed Saddiq’s Armada team, took the stand in the trial that spanned 21 days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During today’s proceedings, Syed Saddiq’s defence counsel Gobind Singh Deo raised an issue in which he pointed out that one of the MACC investigating officers Nurul Hidayah Kamaruddin had not been served or shown the defence’s statements before the trial began
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gobind said Section 62 of the MACC Act 2009 states that the law requires the defence to hand over to the prosecution a statement of defence before the trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this had been done to show that the money raised and used by Syed Saddiq during his campaigning in Muar were for political purposes and not for his personal use, as what the prosecution had alleged

            <p>
                Gobind said that Syed Saddiq had all the receipts to show his expenditure at the material time in 2018, while also pointing out to the three investigating officers today that he had a steady flow of income from 2011

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 27 — The prosecution today rested its case after calling a total of 29 out of 37 witnesses to testify in court against former youth and sports minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman who is accused of misappropriating more than RM1 million as well as criminal breach of trust (CBT)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witnesses, ranging from Syed Saddiq’s parents and star prosecution witness Rafiq Hakim Razali — who is the former Angkatan Bersatu Anak Muda (Armada) assistant treasurer — to MACC officers and members of Syed Saddiq’s Armada team, took the stand in the trial that spanned 21 days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During today’s proceedings, Syed Saddiq’s defence counsel Gobind Singh Deo raised an issue in which he pointed out that one of the MACC investigating officers Nurul Hidayah Kamaruddin had not been served or shown the defence’s statements before the trial began
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gobind said Section 62 of the MACC Act 2009 states that the law requires the defence to hand over to the prosecution a statement of defence before the trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this had been done to show that the money raised and used by Syed Saddiq during his campaigning in Muar were for political purposes and not for his personal use, as what the prosecution had alleged

                Apple CEO Tim Cook has recently visited the company’s upcoming new London headquarters located at Battersea Power Station and has provided a sneak peek on Twitter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is a decommissioned coal power station which has been redeveloped by a consortium of Malaysian developers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a tweet by Tim Cook, they can’t wait to open their new offices in the iconic Battersea Power Station early next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move to Battersea Power Station was reported back in 2016 and it will house around 1,400 employees
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The restored and modernised Battersea Power Station is currently set to open next month on 14th October 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The power station was first opened in 1933 with two chimneys before a near-identical second stage is added which adds another two chimneys to the overall structure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2012, a Malaysian consortium consisting of Sime Darby Berhad, SP Setia Berhad and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) acquired Battersea Power Station for GBP 400 million (about RM1.97 billion)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2019, PNB and EPF completed their acquisition of commercial assets in Phase 2 of Battersea Power Station and it was described to be the most expensive deal in the UK valued at GBP 1.58 billion (RM8.51 billion)
            </p>

                Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo has scored just one goal for club and country this season, as the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's powers start to fade  The Portuguese press have called for Cristiano Ronaldo to be dropped from the starting XI for Tuesday night's game against Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo, 37, is Portugal's skipper but has struggled for form this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has played a supporting role at Manchester United this season - starting just once in the Premier League - and has scored only one goal in all competitions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo did provide an assist in Portugal's 4-0 against Czech Republic in Prague on Saturday night but failed to find the net
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A Bola, one of Portugal's biggest sport publications, ran the headline "menos Ronaldo, mais Portugal" on Monday, which translates into "less Ronaldo, more Portugal"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Do you think Cristiano Ronaldo is still one of the world's best footballers? Let us know in the comments below!  A Bola also claimed Ronaldo 'is losing influence in the selection', his "game volume reduced" and "can start on the bench against Spain" - suggesting Ronaldo could be dropped by manager Fernando Santos
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet he struggled to make an impression alongside Ronaldo last season, seeing his goal tally drop to 10 - with only five of those coming when the veteran played
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking ahead of this month's internationals, Fernandes rubbished claims that he can't play alongside Ronaldo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Most of my assists last season were for him, so I don’t think [it is fair]," he told The Athletic

                Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo has scored just one goal for club and country this season, as the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's powers start to fade  The Portuguese press have called for Cristiano Ronaldo to be dropped from the starting XI for Tuesday night's game against Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo, 37, is Portugal's skipper but has struggled for form this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has played a supporting role at Manchester United this season - starting just once in the Premier League - and has scored only one goal in all competitions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo did provide an assist in Portugal's 4-0 against Czech Republic in Prague on Saturday night but failed to find the net
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A Bola, one of Portugal's biggest sport publications, ran the headline "menos Ronaldo, mais Portugal" on Monday, which translates into "less Ronaldo, more Portugal"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Do you think Cristiano Ronaldo is still one of the world's best footballers? Let us know in the comments below!  A Bola also claimed Ronaldo 'is losing influence in the selection', his "game volume reduced" and "can start on the bench against Spain" - suggesting Ronaldo could be dropped by manager Fernando Santos
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet he struggled to make an impression alongside Ronaldo last season, seeing his goal tally drop to 10 - with only five of those coming when the veteran played
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking ahead of this month's internationals, Fernandes rubbished claims that he can't play alongside Ronaldo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Most of my assists last season were for him, so I don’t think [it is fair]," he told The Athletic
            </p>

                Ever feel no one is really listening on online meetings? Data from Microsoft Corp based on thousands of users of its workplace software found that time spent in meetings has more than tripled since February 2020, and the number of weekly meetings has more than doubled

                “You get a meeting invite and say, ‘I don’t need to be there,’ yet you say yes – why?” Many say yes because it’s a workplace norm – nobody wants to offend the meeting organiser by skipping out, or have co-workers think they’re not engaged

                Peters needed to get a better handle on Riva’s meetings when the pandemic hit and workers went remote, so she asked Rogelberg to speak to Riva’s 100 or so employees

            <p>
                Rogelberg’s earlier research found that poorly managed meetings can hurt employee engagement and even boost their intention to quit, and the morass of meetings got worse during the pandemic due to the shift to remote work and videoconferencing

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Managers, who spend about 20% more time in meetings than the average employee, need to be more judicious in calling them and more upfront about letting people decline them, Rogelberg said

            <p>
                Meeting declines did rise 84% over the past year, according to more recent data from Microsoft, but that’s likely due to the fact that overlapping meetings increased 46% during the same period

                There was never a chance of the Football Association removing Southgate before the World Cup begins in Qatar, but he was on the brink of a new low in his six-year tenure at 2-0 down against Germany in Monday's UEFA Nations League clash at Wembley

            <p>

            <p>
                Southgate's loyalty to Maguire is admirable on a personal level but looks misplaced given the mistakes that have permeated his game for more than a year now

            <p>
                Yet it is that same trusting trait which enabled the England's squad leadership group, comprising among others Kane, Sterling and Jordan Henderson, to feel comfortable enough to approach Southgate and request a private meeting without staff to address the team's slump in form

                Jermain Defoe thinks Harry Maguire is making far too many 'avoidable' mistakes right now Defoe is aware of the criticism that Maguire has faced, and is rooting for him to get back to his best.  He has called for Maguire to try to play with more freedom so that he can return to the form that saw him shine at the World Cup in 2018, and the Euros last year, when he was named in the Team of the Tournament.  'It's a funny one because like I said at the top of the show, there's been a lot of negativity around him and you want him to play well because he's done well in tournaments for England,' Defoe added.  'We've seen him in the tournaments, he's done well to be honest

                About Us Advertise LONDON, Sept 27 — Gareth Southgate hopes England will feel the benefit of being put under intense pressure in recent days at the World Cup after fighting back from 2-0 down to salvage a 3-3 draw against Germany on Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The knives were being sharpened for Southgate after his faith in Harry Maguire backfired for two German goals early in the second half
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Centre-back Maguire has been publicly backed by the England boss despite being dropped at club level by Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kai Havertz then curled brilliantly into the top corner after Maguire was dispossed in the German half
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet, there was more drama to come as Nick Pope spilled Serge Gnabry’s shot and Havertz pounced on the rebound to snatch Germany a point
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Relief for Southgate Despite the disappointment of a late equaliser, there was relief for Southgate that England’s attack finally came to life after accusations that his conservative tactics were to blame for a lack of goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The whole experience has been what we needed,” said Southgate, who had been booed by England fans after a 1-0 defeat to Italy in Milan on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Gundogan coolly slotted into the bottom corner and it seemed game over when Havertz arrowed home his shot from outside the box with 23 minutes to go
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, three goals in 11 minutes got the England support back on side and gave the team some impetus to build on heading to Qatar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any doubt over who Southgate will start in goal against Iran on November 21 appears to over though, as long as Jordan Pickford has recovered from a thigh injury that kept him out of this squad

                The pound’s tumble to as low as US$1.0350 (RM4.78) – fuelled by Kwarteng’s comment on Sunday that there’s “more to come” on tax cuts – has sparked calls for aggressive rate hikes from the Bank of England (BoE), with some analysts urging emergency action as soon as this week

                “The pound is a whisker away from parity and the situation is going to only worsen from here.” While some market participants described the pound’s sudden drop in early Asia hours as a flash crash, the currency has held onto most of its losses and derivatives suggest traders are braced for further declines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The options market now shows about 60% odds of the pound weakening to parity against the dollar this year, up from 32% on Friday

            <p>
                The currency’s selloff began last Friday with the release of the government’s “Growth Plan,” a budget in all but name and the biggest tax giveaway in half a century

            <p>
                Kwarteng scrapped the top level of income tax and cut the basic rate by a percentage point, while also reversing an increase in the National Insurance payroll tax brought in earlier this year

                On Sunday, he appeared unperturbed by the ferocious response that sent UK assets tumbling, telling BBC Television that he wouldn’t comment on market movements, but when it comes to tax cuts, “there’s more to come.” Truss will face a rebellion from Tory backbenchers against her tax cuts if the pound falls to parity with the dollar, the Telegraph reported Saturday

                Meanwhile, some in the markets are already calling for emergency BoE action to stem the tide, an unprecedented action in modern times that would risk adding to the sense of panic

            <p>
                “Of the RM87.4bil foreign direct investment approved by Malaysia in the first half of this year, China’s share amounted to RM48.6bil, accounting for 55.6%,” said Ouyang, in his speech during the 73th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China celebration event organised by the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia here

                Unlike the previous seasons where Bane was played in the jungle, Bren Esports took a gamble and fielded him in the midlane with magic items
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pheww put on an incredible performance on the off-meta hero, and even won MVP of the match
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bren Esports’ team captain made his presence felt in the early game after securing first blood just two minutes in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Deadly Catch-Fatal Links wombo combo was very effective, as Pheww secured kills left and right from the early to mid-game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bren Esports eventually took the insurmountable lead at the 16-minute mark after they secured the Enhanced Lord, which pushed the midlane
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When the Lord was at RSG’s base, Bren ignored everything and went straight for the crystal for the 2-1 victory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the post-game press conference, Pheww explained why out of all the midlane heroes that were available in that match, he went for a fighter hero who has fallen off the meta for the longest time

                Although the new CR-V was unveiled way back in July 2023, production of the sixth generation of Honda’s popular family SUV only started this month, with Honda of Canada Manufacturing kicking off the first production line

            <p>
                It might take some time for it to be launched in Malaysia because Honda Malaysia will have to prepare CKD assembly for it in order to be cost competitive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new sixth gen Honda CR-V measures 4,694 mm long (+69 mm) and 1,864 mm wide (+10 mm), while the height is reduced to 1,681 mm (-8 mm)

            <p>
                Based on North American market specs, it can be had with either a 1.5 litre turbo engine or a 2.0 litre hybrid

            <p>
                At least there is temperature gauge Now that Malaysian ringgit is stronger than the Yen, will Honda Malaysia will make the decision to lower their car prices? Honda also trade in USD and Thai Baht like Nissan, do you think honda cars are cheaper, Whenever the exchange rates are not favorable, you will hear rumblings from the automaker here in Malaysia about impending price increase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a consumer, we need to start questioning why the price will no go down if the exchange rates are the other way round
            </p>

                This March 14, 2013 letter of support — which was signed by Najib as the finance minister then — effectively acted as a government guarantee for the US$3 billion debt, and which would mean the Malaysian government had to bear the debt if the 1MDB subsidiary was unable to make repayments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Finance Ministry’s former deputy secretary-general (policy) Datuk Siti Zauyah Mohd Desa said this while testifying as the 26th prosecution witness in Najib’s trial over the misappropriation of RM2.28 billion of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Siti Zauyah — who had worked for 25 years at the Finance Ministry — said this was not a normal transaction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because in the first place, we had to do the paper and table it to the Cabinet on the same day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was so limited
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was no thorough assessment on the investment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After getting Najib’s approval, Finance Ministry officials had on March 11, 2013 then prepared a memorandum to the Cabinet on behalf of the finance minister Najib to seek the Cabinet’s approval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Cabinet on March 13, 2013 made the decision to agree to the government’s issuance of the letter of support via the Finance Ministry for the 1MDB subsidiary’s US$3 billion debt, with Najib as the finance minister then signing off on the letter of support dated March 14, 2013

                This March 14, 2013 letter of support — which was signed by Najib as the finance minister then — effectively acted as a government guarantee for the US$3 billion debt, and which would mean the Malaysian government had to bear the debt if the 1MDB subsidiary was unable to make repayments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Finance Ministry’s former deputy secretary-general (policy) Datuk Siti Zauyah Mohd Desa said this while testifying as the 26th prosecution witness in Najib’s trial over the misappropriation of RM2.28 billion of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Siti Zauyah — who had worked for 25 years at the Finance Ministry — said this was not a normal transaction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because in the first place, we had to do the paper and table it to the Cabinet on the same day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was so limited
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was no thorough assessment on the investment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After getting Najib’s approval, Finance Ministry officials had on March 11, 2013 then prepared a memorandum to the Cabinet on behalf of the finance minister Najib to seek the Cabinet’s approval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Cabinet on March 13, 2013 made the decision to agree to the government’s issuance of the letter of support via the Finance Ministry for the 1MDB subsidiary’s US$3 billion debt, with Najib as the finance minister then signing off on the letter of support dated March 14, 2013

            <p>
                When you put 20% down on the purchase of a home, you don’t have to borrow as much money as someone whose down payment is only 5% or 10%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And as a result, your monthly mortgage payment may be considerably lower. But 20% down payments, while common, are by no means mandatory or the norm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So if you are hoping to save for retirement in addition to buying a home, you could opt for a 10% down payment and invest the remaining cash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This surcharge, known as PMI, will apply to the mortgage that uses a 10% down payment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We’ll also assume monthly compounding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yes, the smaller down payment of 10% means the mortgage ultimately costs you more over the life of the loan – about $30,000 more, between PMI and higher mortgage payments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the 20% down payment will result in less interest paid over the life of the mortgage, it also will also mean lower monthly payments ($333 less per month)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While putting less than 10% down would leave you paying PMI each month, that surcharge would presumably disappear once you’ve paid the equivalent of your 20% down payment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In our example, your monthly PMI would be $175
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether you choose to make a 20% down payment or put 10% down, there are ways to invest extra cash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The best option we found is to put 10% down, invest the remaining cash and then contribute $175 to your brokerage account each month once PMI is paid off

                Last Friday, Shah Alam High Court judge Datuk Mohd Yazid Mustafa acquitted and discharged Zahid of all 33 charges under Section 16 (A)(B) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act (MACC Act) and seven charges under Section 165 of the Penal Code

                Deputy public prosecutor, Harris Ong Mohd Jeffry Ong said this was reinforced by the fact of the established direct dealings between Datuk Seri Najib Razak, businessman Low Taek Jo or Jho Low and his close associate Eric Tan Kim Loong, through Good Star and Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The principal source of the monies in Datuk Seri Najib’s AmBank account ending with 694 was derived from monies transferred from Good Star and Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners which are companies controlled by Jho Low and Eric Tan,” he said in his written submission in the government’s bid to forfeit the seized items on Monday (Sept 26)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Good Star, Jho Low, Saudi’s Prince Faisal and Prince Saud, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners and Najib did not have any connection or business dealings with 1MDB to justify their receipt of such amounts of monies from 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The subsequent movement of monies from Good Star into Prince Faisal and Prince Saud’s Riyad Bank account and ultimately into Datuk Seri Najib’s AmBank account ending with 694 satisfies the elements of money laundering, which is an offence under Section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA) and the offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property under Section 411 of the Penal Code” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DPP Harris Ong further said that the opening of Najib’s AmBank account (9694) solely to receive 1MDB monies from Good Star and Aabar and followed by Tanore, and the subsequent layering by the opening of Najib AmBank account (1880), AmIslamic (1906) and (1898)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the absence of any justification afforded by Najib, satisfied the element of money laundering under Section 4(1)

                Najib and his wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor are the third parties wanting to claim the jewellery and wrist watches in a forfeiture application filed by the prosecution against Obyu Holdings, owned by businessman Tan Sri Bustari Yusof
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, lawyer Tania Scivetti representing Najib, argued that seven pieces of Richard Mille brand wrist watches were gifts to Najib and there was no nexus between the seized wrist watches and 1MDB funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In the circumstances, we pray that the application be dismissed and the seized watches be immediately returned to Datuk Seri Najib,” she said

            <p>
                Najib’s lead counsel, Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah said among the seven watches, was one purchased by Global Oriented Bhd under an individual named, ‘Datuk Francis’, as proven by the cheque issued by Taman Equine (M) Sdn Bhd, while another wrist watch was purchased and paid for by Datuk Desmond Lim via credit card
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Dividend aristocrats and dividend kings, for example, represent the companies that have the longest track records for increasing dividend payouts year over year

                Again, some dividend stocks can produce higher returns than others

                It’s also important to consider how and where taxes fit in when planning for dividend income

            <p>
                When selecting dividend stocks, it’s important to not be sidetracked by a high dividend yield only, as this may not paint a true picture of the company’s financial health
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This can be a simpler way to diversify with dividend stocks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Growth dividend ETFs, on the other hand, may focus on stocks that are poised to grow their dividend payouts over time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, high yield dividend ETFs may concentrate holdings on the stocks paying the highest dividend yields
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With dividend stocks and dividend ETFs, it’s important to look for an online brokerage that charges zero commission fees to trade

                Bottom Line Dividend stocks and dividend ETFs can provide diversification in a portfolio and they can also generate income for retirement

                What was it like back then? What can we learn from that time? And are we set up for a repeat performance? Before we get to that, let’s examine the 1970s market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That was bad for the market because higher interest rates make future company earnings, and ergo stocks, less valuable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Which in part explains the market’s swoon year to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another factor was that the stock market was richly valued heading into the 1970s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Back then a group of go-go stocks dubbed the Nifty Fifty led the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I like darkness." “When I look back at the bull market we've had in financial assets — it really started in 1982
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So what’s an investor to do? Let’s check in with someone who was steeped in the market back then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I remember it was a period where it was tough to make money, unless you were a really good stock picker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And I hold some of them to this day.” Now, let’s go back and take a closer look at what happened 50 years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The nice thing is, there were companies that did very, very well in that environment back then,” Druckenmiller says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It wasn’t all darkness back in the 1970s

                What was it like back then? What can we learn from that time? And are we set up for a repeat performance? Before we get to that, let’s examine the 1970s market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That was bad for the market because higher interest rates make future company earnings, and ergo stocks, less valuable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Which in part explains the market’s swoon year to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another factor was that the stock market was richly valued heading into the 1970s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Back then a group of go-go stocks dubbed the Nifty Fifty led the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I like darkness." “When I look back at the bull market we've had in financial assets — it really started in 1982
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So what’s an investor to do? Let’s check in with someone who was steeped in the market back then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I remember it was a period where it was tough to make money, unless you were a really good stock picker
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And I hold some of them to this day.” Now, let’s go back and take a closer look at what happened 50 years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The nice thing is, there were companies that did very, very well in that environment back then,” Druckenmiller says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It wasn’t all darkness back in the 1970s
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>
                        <p> </p>

                Uma Devi testified that the monies that went into Najib's AmIslamic bank account ending 694 were through transactions that took place in March and April 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the account statement, the witness said RM155mil went into Najib's account on March 22, 2013, three times
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Four days later on March 26, RM188,001,963.02 was credited into the account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "On March 28, 2013, RM231,150,000 and RM138,824,962.98 went into the account in two transactions," Uma Devi said during the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) trial on Monday (Sept 26)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The total for all the nine transactions were RM2,081,476,926
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I confirm that the monies went into the account based on the account statement dated April 14, 2013 that is referred to me," she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To a question by deputy public prosecutor Najwa Bistamam on whether an ATM card was given to the account holder, the witness said that based on record, no ATM card was granted for the account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In its opening statement, lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram had told the court that nine money laundering charges faced by Najib in the case involved a sum of RM2,081,476,926
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib, 69, is facing four charges of using his position to obtain bribes totalling RM2.28bil from 1MDB funds and 21 charges of money laundering involving the same amount

                Latest filings revealed that in addition to over S$530 million that Alibaba topped Lazada up with in May, the Chinese giant added another S$1.28 billion, bringing the total to just over S$1.8 billion for 2022
            </p>

                Alibaba and Sea could not be more different

                Its Chinese parent has thus far pumped, on average, close to S$2 billion into the company each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By the time Shopee debuted, Lazada was already an established billion-dollar venture present in several countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And then, the new platform showed Lazada its place

            <p>
                And while rudderless Lazada kept appointing a new CEO each year on average, Shopee successfully exported its methodology further abroad, starting with Latin America
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, Lazada announced that it wants to push US$100 billion in GMV per year by 2030, while Shopee is already hitting US$80 billion across all of its markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Being a manager — even a CEO — is always just a job (even if you’re bestowed with some stock options as part of your package)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is why I don’t think Lazada can compete with Shopee as long as Forrest Li is closely in charge of the business

                “The Perodua Ativa Hybrid would be the best vehicle for us to gain unique insights on Malaysian behaviour as a controlled group, as this data will be used to anticipate our customers’ needs when using an electric vehicle,” said Perodua president and CEO Datuk Seri Zainal Abidin Ahmad

                This is a CBU Daihatsu Rocky Hybrid, just with Perodua badging on the front, rear (P2 and Ativa) and steering wheel

                So, what do you think of the Ativa Hybrid and this subscription deal? Good deal or you’re better off just buying the turbo-powered regular Ativa? In any case, P2 received 600 applications for the plan and all 300 cars are already spoken for

                Asked about allegations that Najib was given the codename “Merpati” or pigeon as a prisoner and that he is getting preferential treatment as a prisoner, Shafee rubbished this idea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “What is Merpati? They keeping pigeon in the hospital? Merpati is normally for pondan

                How can you say a man is a bird? I mean, describe she’s a nice bird, I won’t say he’s a nice bird, can you? He will run away,” he said in reply to reporters when met at the court complex here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for claims that Najib receives special treatment as a prisoner, Shafee pointed out that his client allegedly is not given a specific room for his meals during breaks in court proceedings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No, you will be surprised, if he’s special, they don’t even give him a room here for him to sit down and eat,” he said

            <p>
                Najib is believed to have been placed in a holding room attached to the courtroom during breaks in the court proceeding

            <p>
                Shafee also dismissed the idea that Najib was given a first-class room at Hospital Kuala Lumpur or the Cheras Rehabilitation Hospital, saying that he had visited his client and that it was just a standard hospital room
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maybe his food, because of the ulcer, yes, they cannot give him spicy food, they cannot give him oily food.” Asked if Najib is getting outside food, Shafee denied this by saying, “Cannot what (sic)”, before adding that even the family today were not allowed to provide food to Najib due to the need to monitor his diet in relation to his health condition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked why Najib had to be transferred from Hospital Kuala Lumpur to the Cheras Rehabilitation Hospital previously, Shafee said Najib was already receiving physiotherapy at Hospital Kuala Lumpur but that it was not adequate

                Shafee said Najib had also lost weight, and his stomach ulcer and knee problem are still there

                On September 23, the Cheras Rehabilitation Hospital announced that Najib was in good health and sent back to Kajang prison

                Trent Alexander-Arnold has been left out of the England matchday squad for their dead-rubber against Germany, but Gareth Southgate might have just done Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp a massive favour Follow the latest transfer news and more with our LFC newsletter We have more newsletters Jurgen Klopp might admittedly not be the biggest fan of international football, but he is the staunchest defender of his own squad when they report for their respective nations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet his treatment pales in comparison to that of Trent Alexander-Arnold after the right-back was left out of the matchday squad to face Germany
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will always be scrutiny regarding Alexander-Arnold’s limited involvement for England, seeing as he is English football’s most creative player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ironically though, Southgate has perhaps never been more justified to overlook Alexander-Arnold considering the right-back is in the worst form of his Liverpool career
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Injuries have ultimately not helped Klopp’s squad but the likes of Alexander-Arnold could be accused of suffering a hangover of their own after missing out on the Premier League and Champions League at the final last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet rather than call him up and not use him, should Southgate have not just left an out-of-form Alexander-Arnold out of his latest camp entirely? Either way, perhaps his treatment of the defender could be a blessing in disguise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With his World Cup place under increasing threat, Alexander-Arnold has something else to play for when he returns to the AXA Training Centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His main concern will always be getting the defender firing for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ultimately it’s win-win for Liverpool and the German now as they look to get the best back out of their overlooked defender
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If not, he’s given a winter off to work with Klopp in their mid-season training camp, giving the Reds a prolonged period to build Alexander-Arnold back up before unleashing him back on Premier League defences in 2023 after yet another snub, regardless of its justification
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Southgate might have inadvertently done Liverpool the biggest of favours and handed Klopp the key to unlocking the real Trent Alexander-Arnold again, and waving off this poor imitation once and for all

                WhatsApp 0-Day BugsCVE-2022-36934 – An integer overflow in WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.22.16.12, Business for Android prior to v2.22.16.12, iOS prior to v2.22.16.12, Business for iOS prior to v2.22.16.12 could result in remote code execution in an established video call
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Simplifying these following vulnerabilities, Whatsapp could cause your device to be hacked by receiving a Video File or When on a Video call
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An Integer overflow bug that affects WhatsApp allows attackers to execute the specially crafted arbitrary code during an established Video call without any sort of user interaction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An integer overflow also know as “wraparound” occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation.  This RCE bug affects an unknown code of the WhatsApp component Video Call Handler, which allows an attacker to manipulate the bug to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and take complete control of WhatsApp Messenger
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to WhatsApp Advisory “An integer overflow in WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.22.16.12, Business for Android prior to v2.22.16.12, iOS prior to v2.22.16.12, Business for iOS prior to v2.22.16.12 could result in remote code execution in an established video call.” An Integer Underflow vulnerability (CVE-2022-27492) allows attackers to execute the arbitrary code remotely, and user interaction is required to exploit this bug successfully
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This issue affects an unknown code block of the component Video File Handler
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a memory corruption vulnerability.  According to the WhatsApp advisory “An integer underflow in WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.22.16.2, WhatsApp for iOS v2.22.15.9 could have caused remote code execution when receiving a crafted video file.” To exploit this vulnerability, attackers drop a crafted video file on the user’s WhatsApp messenger

                Two of the watches, one costing RM1.58 million and the other RM500,400, were bought by Datuk (now Tan Sri) Yeoh Seok Ping of YTL fame, Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah and Tania Scivetti submitted during hearing of a forfeiture application in the High Court on Monday (Sept 26)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Scivetti said the RM500,400 watch was paid for by Yeoh via Taman Equine (M) Sdn Bhd, while the RM1.58 million watch was paid via Sykt Pembenaan Yeoh Tiong Lay Sdn Bhd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The third watch, costing RM419,300, was paid for by Datuk (now Tan Sri) Desmond Lim, the lawyer said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee, meanwhile, submitted that judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin should make a similar ruling as he did when dismissing the prosecution’s forfeiture case with regards to RM114 million worth of local and foreign currency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee said when the prosecution had failed to prove the predicate offence, then the third-party claim filed by Najib should be allowed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s lawyers want Jamil to allow their third-party claim for the return of the seven watches to Najib, and dismiss the prosecution’s attempt to forfeit the watches under the Anti Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds from Unlawful Activity Act 2001 (AMLATFPUA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution had claimed that Alsen Chance Holding Ltd had also paid US$1.580 million to a Richard Mille outlet through two payments in August 2012 for the purchase of the branded watches and it further claimed that the rest of the watches were from these proceeds of Alsen Chance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Scivetti and Shafee argued that the evidence on the purchase by the two businessman for Najib showed that there is a serious gap to the prosecution’s case or claims that the purchase of the watches came from 1MDB as alleged
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosmah is challenging the prosecution’s attempt to forfeit 2,345 pieces of jewellery that were seized by the police in the Pavilion condo raid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The remaining 9,000 pieces of jewellery that had been seized in the raid could not be proven to be from 1MDB proceeds, resulting in the prosecution amending its notice of forfeiture to only 2,345 pieces of jewellery, seven watches and 29 handbags
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Jamil has fixed Nov 14 for decision on the forfeiture application

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Scivetti said the RM500,400 watch was paid for by Yeoh via Taman Equine (M) Sdn Bhd, while the RM1.58 million watch was paid via Sykt Pembenaan Yeoh Tiong Lay Sdn Bhd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The third watch, costing RM419,300, was paid for by Datuk (now Tan Sri) Desmond Lim, the lawyer said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee, meanwhile, submitted that judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin should make a similar ruling as he did when dismissing the prosecution’s forfeiture case with regards to RM114 million worth of local and foreign currency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee said when the prosecution had failed to prove the predicate offence, then the third-party claim filed by Najib should be allowed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s lawyers want Jamil to allow their third-party claim for the return of the seven watches to Najib, and dismiss the prosecution’s attempt to forfeit the watches under the Anti Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds from Unlawful Activity Act 2001 (AMLATFPUA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution had claimed that Alsen Chance Holding Ltd had also paid US$1.580 million to a Richard Mille outlet through two payments in August 2012 for the purchase of the branded watches and it further claimed that the rest of the watches were from these proceeds of Alsen Chance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Scivetti and Shafee argued that the evidence on the purchase by the two businessman for Najib showed that there is a serious gap to the prosecution’s case or claims that the purchase of the watches came from 1MDB as alleged
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosmah is challenging the prosecution’s attempt to forfeit 2,345 pieces of jewellery that were seized by the police in the Pavilion condo raid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The remaining 9,000 pieces of jewellery that had been seized in the raid could not be proven to be from 1MDB proceeds, resulting in the prosecution amending its notice of forfeiture to only 2,345 pieces of jewellery, seven watches and 29 handbags
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Jamil has fixed Nov 14 for decision on the forfeiture application
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 26 — Malaysian taxpayers could have to pay up to an additional RM1 billion for the country’s 15th general election if the ruling coalition forces one in November or the heart of the yearly monsoonal floods, a former Election Commission (EC) chairman predicted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When it comes to determining the date of an election, EC can only act as an advisory entity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This would mean that the additional expenditure alone for the poll would be around double what it cost to conduct the 2018 general election in its entirety
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abdul Aziz said that most of this extra RM1 billion would be spent on logistics, particularly on transporting voters to their respective polling stations in constituencies that were flooded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prediction would put the cost of holding GE15 above what it would have cost the country to hold a general election at the end of 2020 or during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Datuk Takiyuddin Hassan told Parliament that the additional measures and precautions of the movement control order (MCO) meant it would have cost RM1.2 billion for Malaysia to go to the polls then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both were already significantly more than the RM171 million that was allocated for the 2008 general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, the EC was quoted saying the 15th general election could cost taxpayers up to RM1.1 billion in what could be the most expensive national polls to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abdul Aziz explained that a hypothetical GE15 during flood season would be more complex as the commission would also have to coordinate and liaise with additional entities such as the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma) for remedies

                Malaysia nationalist party Umno has been agitating for an early general election within the year, with speculation that this could be in November as the 2023 Budget has yet to be tabled

                Stewart Robson questions Gareth Southgate's ability to adjust his tactics when England are struggling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Why would I be any different? I am not arrogant enough to think that my contract is going to protect me in any way." Time and perspective will ultimately serve Southgate well when it comes to assessing his time as England manager
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no Southgate within the FA system now and with Graham Potter leaving Brighton for Chelsea earlier this month, the outstanding English candidate no longer seems to be available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So if that remains the case, whenever Southgate's time comes to an end, the list of candidates becomes extremely short very quickly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Potter remains the bookmakers' favourite to become the next England manager, despite being less than a month into his new job at Stamford Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Champions League is now the real pinnacle of the game, so it is difficult to imagine Potter giving that up to manage England just yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Newcastle's Eddie Howe is second favourite, but like Potter, is in the early stages of a club job that could take him into the Champions League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Neither Gerrard or Lampard are perfect candidates, but the same can be said for Potter, Howe and the other names being mentioned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is perhaps why the FA will be so keen for Southgate to ride out the storm that engulfs him right now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unless they are prepared to start with a clean slate and open the job up to the best coach available, rather than the top homegrown one, Southgate might still be the best option for England.

            <p>
                Shopee is simply slightly better at everything

            <p>
                And while rudderless Lazada kept appointing a new CEO each year on average, Shopee successfully exported its methodology further abroad, starting with Latin America
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, Lazada announced that it wants to push US$100 billion in GMV per year by 2030, while Shopee is already hitting US$80 billion across all of its markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is why I don’t think Lazada can compete with Shopee as long as Forrest Li is closely in charge of the business

                And while rudderless Lazada kept appointing a new CEO each year on average, Shopee successfully exported its methodology further abroad, starting with Latin America
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, Lazada announced that it wants to push US$100 billion in GMV per year by 2030, while Shopee is already hitting US$80 billion across all of its markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is why I don’t think Lazada can compete with Shopee as long as Forrest Li is closely in charge of the business

                Now in its third generation, the X1 is the entry model in the German carmaker’s X line-up and will be offered with internal combustion engines (petrol and diesel), plug-in hybrid and fully electric powertrains – all roll off a single assembly line for the first time at BMW Group Plant Regensburg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The mill is augmented by a 48-volt mild hybrid system that includes an electric motor rated at 19 PS (19 hp or 14 kW) and 55 Nm, resulting in a total system output of 218 PS (215 hp) and 360 Nm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The mild hybrid system also features a 20 Ah battery in the luggage compartment and serves to boost both efficiency and power delivery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A seven-speed dual-clutch Steptronic is standard for all ICE variants, including the sDrive18i and xDrive23d, the latter also benefitting from a mild hybrid system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These elements are mirrored for the rear bumper and the sides also gain silver rocker panels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the rear, the M Sport’s rear bumper has a bottom trim piece with a diffuser-like element set below a large blacked-out area that mimics the 3 Series with the M Sport package
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One small point to note is this xDrive30 is without the blue accents like we saw during the global debut, but you can identify an iX1 by its “i” badge on the grille and blue ring on the BMW roundel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The BMW Curved Display takes centre stage here, with a 10.25-inch instrument cluster display and a 10.7-inch central touchscreen

            <p>
                A year on from the launch of the Ativa, Perodua has introduced a hybrid version of its smallest SUV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We say this because the Ativa Hybrid isn’t officially available for sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perodua is instead offering the car on a subscription basis, both to suss out consumers’ readiness for an “electric vehicle” (even though there’s definitely a petrol engine in there) and demand of a five-year subscription service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All units of the Ativa Hybrid are painted pearl white with no black roof option, unlike the regular Ativa
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At this juncture you might have noticed that the car looks a little different from the regular Ativa
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s already well-known that the latter is based on the Daihatsu Rocky, but the Hybrid model is literally a Rocky Hybrid with Perodua and Ativa badges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also has a completely different engine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The big benefit is fuel consumption – the Hybrid achieves a claimed 28km per litre combined on the WLTP cycle, compared to 20.7km per litre for the standard Rocky, which shares the Ativa’s 1.0-litre mill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Perodua’s (very optimistic) Malaysian Driving Cycle, the car can go up to 31.3 km per litre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the outside, the Ativa Hybrid retains the Rocky’s angular front and rear bumpers, replete with the Hybrid-specific honeycomb grille
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Daihatsu’s interior has also been carried over, ditching the Ativa’s black-and-red leather seats in favour of all-black leather and fabric

            <p>
                China’s FAST telescope has deepened the mystery surrounding the origin and nature of cosmic explosions known as fast radio bursts after detecting features that cannot be explained by existing physical models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are powerful flashes of radio waves from deep space that only last for milliseconds, but they generate as much energy as the Sun does in a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first fast radio burst was discovered in 2007, and since then, hundreds of these cosmic flashes have been detected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, their origin and physical nature remain unclear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previous studies have suggested that the first fast radio burst detected from the Milky Way had originated from a magnetar, which is a highly magnetic neutron star
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team was led by scientists from Peking University and the National Astronomical Observatories of China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They detected 1,863 bursts in 82 hours over 54 days from an active fast radio burst source called FRB 20201124A in a galaxy outside our own
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zhang said it had been thought that young magnetars would only be found in active star-forming regions of a galaxy, but the FRB is in a region where no such activity takes place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It had also been assumed that FRBs exist in regions of galaxies with a high stellar density, but the research team found the FRB source did not reside there, providing new clues to their origin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a separate study published in Nature Communications, Nanjing University’s Wang proposed that the fast radio burst source might originate from a binary system containing a magnetar and a high-mass Be star, which is a heterogeneous set of stars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this new model provides important clues to explain the origin of fast radio bursts, and it could also explain three other recently discovered FRBs

            <p>
                President Vladimir Putin's move to order Russia's first military mobilisation since World War Two triggered protests across the country and seen flocks of military-age men flee, causing tailbacks at borders and flights to sell out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Multiple reports have also documented how people with no military service have been issued draft papers - contrary to Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu's guarantee that only those with special military skills or combat experience would be called up - prompting even ultra-loyal pro-Kremlin figures to publicly express concern
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's top two parliamentarians, both close Putin allies, explicitly addressed public anger at the way the mobilisation drive was unfolding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Valentina Matviyenko, the chairwoman of Russia's upper house, the Federation Council, said she was aware of reports of men who should be ineligible for the draft being called up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without a single mistake." Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, Russia's lower chamber, also expressed concern in a separate post
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Authorities at every level should understand their responsibilities." Officials say 300,000 more Russians will called up to serve in the mobilisation campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kremlin has twice denied it actually plans to draft more than one million, following two separate reports in independent Russian media outlets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rights groups saying more than 2,000 have been detained at rallies against mobilisation in dozens of cities so far this week, with more protests already having been recorded on Sunday in Russia's Far East and Siberia

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Multiple reports have also documented how people with no military service have been issued draft papers - contrary to Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu's guarantee that only those with special military skills or combat experience would be called up - prompting even ultra-loyal pro-Kremlin figures to publicly express concern
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's top two parliamentarians, both close Putin allies, explicitly addressed public anger at the way the mobilisation drive was unfolding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Valentina Matviyenko, the chairwoman of Russia's upper house, the Federation Council, said she was aware of reports of men who should be ineligible for the draft being called up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without a single mistake." Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, Russia's lower chamber, also expressed concern in a separate post
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Authorities at every level should understand their responsibilities." Officials say 300,000 more Russians will called up to serve in the mobilisation campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kremlin has twice denied it actually plans to draft more than one million, following two separate reports in independent Russian media outlets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rights groups saying more than 2,000 have been detained at rallies against mobilisation in dozens of cities so far this week, with more protests already having been recorded on Sunday in Russia's Far East and Siberia

                While early signs indicated Liverpool had no plans to activate Arthur Melo's £32m transfer clause, that could change amid Naby Keïta's contract uncertainty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the outcome of proposed contract talks with the Liverpool midfielder could cause a ripple effect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is understood that one of the key reasons for the discussions over a new deal is that Liverpool are keen to not lose Keïta on a free transfer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! And with Arthur now available for £32m, as part of the option to make the loan deal permanent, Liverpool could switch focus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With or without a new deal for Keïta, a positive season from Arthur could see the Guinean midfielder's time on Merseyside enter its final stages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Liverpool, though, all eyes will be on whether they could yet welcome another addition to the squad's Portuguese-speaking contingent on a long-term basis

                While early signs indicated Liverpool had no plans to activate Arthur Melo's £32m transfer clause, that could change amid Naby Keïta's contract uncertainty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the outcome of proposed contract talks with the Liverpool midfielder could cause a ripple effect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is understood that one of the key reasons for the discussions over a new deal is that Liverpool are keen to not lose Keïta on a free transfer

            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! And with Arthur now available for £32m, as part of the option to make the loan deal permanent, Liverpool could switch focus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With or without a new deal for Keïta, a positive season from Arthur could see the Guinean midfielder's time on Merseyside enter its final stages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Liverpool, though, all eyes will be on whether they could yet welcome another addition to the squad's Portuguese-speaking contingent on a long-term basis

                He said under Article 48(1)(e) of the Federal Constitution, an individual is disqualified as a member of either House of Parliament if they have been convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year or a fine of not less than RM2,000, and have not received a pardon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Constitution also stipulates that if an application for a pardon was filed within 14 days of the date of conviction, then the disqualification will only come into effect as soon as the petition is disposed of

                “Article 50 says ‘if’ he becomes disqualified – but he hasn’t become disqualified because his disqualification has not taken effect by virtue of his application for pardon and also review,” he said

                England have gone from being one of the most prolific teams in Europe to failing to score from open play in five consecutive games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One goal always looked likely to be enough to beat an England team short on ideas and intensity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why does Raheem Sterling, to take the most high-profile example, look like a pale imitation of the player he is at club level and has long been for England? Captain Harry Kane seemed set to beat Wayne Rooney’s 53-goal all-time scoring record in time for the World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I know the strikers and attacking players here are confident players.” The problem is, England don’t look confident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It feels like a lot of the intensity and belief has gone out of Southgate’s England, particularly up front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bukayo Saka found himself playing left wing-back in Milan on Friday night, but Southgate doesn’t seem to have many other solutions beyond the trusty back-three comes good again, rather than finding a way to make a back four work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Relying on a teenager with limited big tournament experience is a risk, but Southgate has little choice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even England’s set-pieces, such a potent weapon at the 2018 World Cup, aren’t working anymore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So it feels a lot like Southgate’s side have become the football version of the nation’s cricket team in 1986
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So maybe, just maybe, it will be alright on the night in Qatar

                The Mexican striker netted twice in the Galaxy's 3-2 win on Saturday night after San Jose Ultras held up a banner that read 'The LA circus - same clowns, different costumes' with a pair of clowns underneath
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chicharito, the former Manchester United forward, celebrated both his goals by acting like a clown and pulling a comical face to the home fans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                San Jose fans mocked visitors LA Galaxy by unfurling a clown tifo ahead of Saturday's game But the stunt backfired after Mexican striker Javier Hernandez scored twice and marked each of his goals with a clown celebration 'Unbelievable and amazing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The best way to respond to a tifo like that is scoring two goals and celebrating like a clown,' he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The win could prove valuable as Galaxy look to wrap up a play-off place, while San Jose remain bottom of the standings.

                The Mexican striker netted twice in the Galaxy's 3-2 win on Saturday night after San Jose Ultras held up a banner that read 'The LA circus - same clowns, different costumes' with a pair of clowns underneath
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chicharito, the former Manchester United forward, celebrated both his goals by acting like a clown and pulling a comical face to the home fans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                San Jose fans mocked visitors LA Galaxy by unfurling a clown tifo ahead of Saturday's game But the stunt backfired after Mexican striker Javier Hernandez scored twice and marked each of his goals with a clown celebration 'Unbelievable and amazing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The best way to respond to a tifo like that is scoring two goals and celebrating like a clown,' he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The win could prove valuable as Galaxy look to wrap up a play-off place, while San Jose remain bottom of the standings.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thaw Nandar Aung, also known as Han Lay, told The Associated Press by phone that she has been stuck at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport since being denied reentry to Thailand when she arrived Wednesday night from a short trip to Vietnam

            <p>
                Myanmar’s military seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and has cracked down heavily on widespread opposition to its rule
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - AFP Thaw Nandar Aung said she was charged in absentia in September last year under a section of Myanmar's Penal Code covering sedition for speaking out against the military takeover at the pageant and online
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Thursday night, Thai police told her that Myanmar police had come to see her, but she declined to meet them, Thaw Nandar Aung said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thaw Nandar Aung used her platform as the Myanmar contestant at last year's Miss Grand International beauty pageant in the Thai capital, Bangkok, to speak about the killings of pro-democracy protesters in her homeland

                "In doing so, the leaders involved should not use their power and selfishness.” "Today in my country, Myanmar, while I am going to be on this stage, there are so many people dying, more than 100 people died today
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Barcelona have confirmed Ronald Araujo suffered a thigh injury while on international duty with Uruguay, adding to the Blaugrana's defensive problems after Jules Kounde sustained a hamstring injury
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Araujo was substituted just five minutes into Uruguay's 1-0 friendly loss to Iran in Austria on Friday, having pulled up less than a minute into the match.  Earlier on Friday, the French Football Federation announced Jules Kounde was to leave Didier Deschamps' squad after being replaced during their Nations League win over Austria on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcelona have now revealed the nature of the duo's injuries, with Araujo suffering an avulsion fracture in his right thigh and Kounde having a biceps femoris injury in his left hamstring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Losing both Araujo and Kounde for any significant period of time would be a major blow for Xavi, who has made the pair defensive mainstays in his new-look team

                The Umno president who was just acquitted of all 40 graft charges in the Foreign Visa System (VLN) case said for those who tried to belittle Umno and their leadership under Barisan Nasional, the coming general elections would prove the unity and mechanism that Umno has at the grassroots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid then claimed that he was subjected to ridicule and negative labels, including attempts to topple him from the Umno presidency, when he was undergoing the trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I am not afraid to defend the Umno despite various political threats," he said Ahmad Zahid then reiterated claims that his court case was politically motivated after he refused to heed calls by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to dissolve Umno when the latter was prime minister under Pakatan Harapan rule
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I did not waver and the fact is, I still fight to defend Umno after being trusted by our grassroots all over the country to carry out my duties as president," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Friday (Sept 23), Ahmad Zahid was freed of all 40 graft charges in the VLN case after the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case

                About Us Advertise   KOTA KINABALU, Sept 24 — Authorities yesterday had to remove a 900-metre fishing net that was found near a famous diving spot in Sipadan island, damaging some of its coral reefs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The net, which had drifted away from a fishing boat, was caught on the famed Barracuda Point dive site and extended toward Hanging Gardens, with some 18 fishes caught in it, including two sharks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Jafry Arifin said that the net was sighted at about 6am yesterday by a Sabah Parks ranger and the dive marshal on duty when they saw the floating buoys of the net which had drifted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “After calling in and reporting the matter, work began to remove the net with the help of several dive operators — Seahorse Scuba, Borneo Jungle and Dive Semporna
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The mission took all day, to clear the net from Barracuda Point to North Point, but by night time, some 200m was left
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A wooden fishing boat had also approached the marine park yesterday morning around 9.40am, without a permit to enter, and claimed responsibility for the net which had drifted with the currents into the park

                About Us Advertise   KOTA KINABALU, Sept 24 — Authorities yesterday had to remove a 900-metre fishing net that was found near a famous diving spot in Sipadan island, damaging some of its coral reefs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The net, which had drifted away from a fishing boat, was caught on the famed Barracuda Point dive site and extended toward Hanging Gardens, with some 18 fishes caught in it, including two sharks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Jafry Arifin said that the net was sighted at about 6am yesterday by a Sabah Parks ranger and the dive marshal on duty when they saw the floating buoys of the net which had drifted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “After calling in and reporting the matter, work began to remove the net with the help of several dive operators — Seahorse Scuba, Borneo Jungle and Dive Semporna
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The mission took all day, to clear the net from Barracuda Point to North Point, but by night time, some 200m was left
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A wooden fishing boat had also approached the marine park yesterday morning around 9.40am, without a permit to enter, and claimed responsibility for the net which had drifted with the currents into the park
