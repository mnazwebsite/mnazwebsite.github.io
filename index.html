                Hamzah also said former Sabah chief minister Shafie Apdal was able to form the Warisan-led state government with the help of those who jumped ship, also from BN

                In 2018, Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu Sarawak (PBB), Sarawak United Peoples’ Party (SUPP), Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) and Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) quit the BN coalition to set up GPS

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hamzah, who is also the home minister, said Warisan would never have been able to form the state government if it had refused to accept party hoppers

                He then went on to justify his party’s decision to quit Pakatan Harapan (PH) in 2020, which led to the collapse of the PH government, by citing “public interest”

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 — The Oktoberfest event should not be openly celebrated and held as a festival open to the public, said Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Idris Ahmad
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim had asked the Prime Minister to state the government's stance in the celebration of Bon Odori and Oktoberfest, which are Japanese and German cultural events under the auspices of their respective embassies
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Bon Odori, Idris said that while the government didn't stop the event from happening, but only advised Muslims from not attending the event, as a study by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (Jakim) alleged that the festival contained elements from other religions and has ceremonies that are contrary to the teachings of Islam
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On June 6, Idris advised Muslims not to participate in the Bon Odori Festival that was to be held at the Shah Alam Sports Complex on July 16, as the festival contains elements of other religions
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Idris was told to attend the annual event himself "so that he could learn to make the distinction between culture and religion”, a sharp and direct censure rarely made by a monarch
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Bon Odori simply means the "Bon dance”, which is performed during Obon, an annual event when the Japanese honour the spirits of their ancestors.

                Working at a restaurant here, the 36-year-old mother of three had left their squatter home near Taman Elok in Bukit Nenas here for work like any other day, without any inkling of the fate that would befall her and her family
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                However, Razma returned home at about 8pm only to find the remnants of her former home that had collapsed after being hit by a landslip moments earlier

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “When the landslip occurred, all my children were at home with my parents but I never thought such an incident would take place as it has never happened while we lived there,” she said, when met at the site on Thursday (July 28)

                Norain, 11, and Isa Sabri, aged two, were killed after their house, which was home to a family of nine, was buried in a landslide following hours of heavy rain in the state capital on Wednesday night

                Meanwhile, Razma’s father, Botong Jaafar, 57, said he saw first-hand how the landslip “swallowed up” Isa and Norain, both of whom were his grandchildren

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She filed the suit last year, claiming that the grandchildren had control of the money deposited in Jamaluddin’s local and overseas accounts

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the judge denied two other claims by Aminah involving shares worth RM313 million in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd, which he held did not form part of Jamaluddin’s estate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Aminah is also embroiled in a civil suit in the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court to obtain her share of RM1 billion from her daughter-in-law Kalsom Ismail

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Kalsom, a former dentist, filed the suit in early 2018 to get 50% of Jamaluddin’s moveable and immovable properties acquired here and overseas valued at RM2.1 billion from the deceased’s estate

                The investigation follows Klang MP Charles Santiago’s police report against Apandi in Klang yesterday in light of a Kuala Lumpur High Court’s decision and Pejuang’s report at a police station in Shah Alam on July 25

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, Santiago said it was evident that Apandi had abused his power during his time as AG under the former Najib Razak-led government as noted in High Court judge Azimah Omar’s judgment when dismissing a defamation suit filed by Apandi against DAP veteran Lim Kit Siang

                The Special Task Force on Jihad against Inflation, according to experts, is on the right track to deal with the rising cost of living, an issue Malaysians have been grappling with lately

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Special Task Force on Jihad against Inflation, which was set up on June 29 and chaired by Communications and Multimedia Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa, was created to help Malaysians to deal with the rising cost of living
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "It is necessary to establish such a task force because problems related to inflation and cost of living have been impacting the people since last year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Urging Malaysians to give space to the special task force to resolve the issues related to inflation, Ariff Azly said the creation of the team is a preliminary step in the government’s efforts to address inflation
            </p>

                The Singapore Court of Appeal said LFL had abused the system by joining the pair in filing a criminal motion seeking a review of an earlier decision to uphold the death sentences, The Straits Times reported
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Charles Yeo, the counsel for Singaporean Roslan Bakar and Sabahan Pausi Jefridin, was also ordered to pay S$4,000 in costs to the attorney-general
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court said the motion filed by the duo and LFL caused the Singaporean attorney-general to incur unnecessary cost in both proceedings
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Roslan and Pausi were arrested in 2008 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death two years later
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The duo were initially scheduled to be sent to the gallows on Feb 16, but Yeo filed a criminal motion seeking a review of the apex court’s 2018 decision
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yeo then filed a civil application to start judicial review proceedings to declare that the death sentences were unconstitutional, but this was dismissed on Feb 16

                On Tuesday, a witness in Zahid’s trial testified that RM2.6 million in political donations was given to Bersatu, the party which was formerly chaired by Mahathir

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                David Tan, UKSB’s former administrative manager, said the sum was passed to Rahmat after Pakatan Harapan (PH) won the 2018 general election and Mahathir was appointed the prime minister for the second time
