                About 200 people congregated at the area from 2pm, calling for ministers responsible for the failure of the littoral combat ship (LCS) project to be sacked or brought to justice

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lorry driver Saffri Kamaruddin, 50, admitted that his EPF savings would not be enough to sustain him after retirement in view of the rising cost of living
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said he planned to use whatever he has as EPF savings as capital to run a business
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A factory worker, known as Krishnan, 55, said he has increased his monthly contribution to EPF to ensure his savings will be enough when he retires
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If it’s not enough, then I will have to work after retiring
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Meanwhile, a consultant at an aviation school, Zulfadli Halim, 50, said that the hike in the cost of living has made it difficult for him to increase his monthly contribution to EPF and he was worried about his future

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “EPF members’ savings are at a low and very worrying level, especially after the four withdrawals and the reduction in the employee share of the statutory contribution rate,” he said, adding that as of June 30, 6.62 million members — or 52% of the total of 12.78 million EPF members aged under 55 — had savings of less than RM10,000

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The PSB president revealed today that as its candidate in the Sarawak state elections last December, See signed a contract that required him to quit from the state assembly if he chose to resign from the party having won the seat under the PSB ticket
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said See’s resignation from the party, as announced by Sarawak state assembly Speaker Asfia Awang Nasar earlier today, would mean he must now vacate his seat
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “See is fully aware of the commitments, both oral and written, that he had given to PSB before he was selected to be the PSB candidate for Batu Lintang,” Wong said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Noting that See was a senior lawyer, Wong said the now independent assemblyman knew what he committed to in writing before he was chosen as a candidate for the state constituency
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As a matter of principle, PSB will avail itself of all necessary actions and remedies in respect of the commitments made by See.” Aside from vacating his seat, Wong said the agreement also included an undertaking to compensate the party if See quit the party after enjoying the benefit of PSB’s resources in getting elected
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “See is fully aware of the support and resources given to him by PSB as well as its supporters,” he said

                Deputy chief minister Bung Moktar Radin said this is one of the main reasons behind high unemployment and poverty rates in the state

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that the state government was sensitive to the situation where the completion of infrastructure projects, especially the construction of the Pan Borneo Highway, is an important effort to attract investors and further stimulate the state’s economic development
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “However, we will not let these problems continue,” he told reporters after officiating the state-level rehabilitation aspiration programme here last night

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Bung Moktar, who is state works minister, was asked to comment on the latest economic report which states that Sabah has one of the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Kinabatangan MP said that the state government had also asked Putrajaya to increase the number of work packages for the highway construction project for implementation next year in order to speed up the completion of the Pan Borneo Highway

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a statement on Sunday (Aug 14) Wong said PSB deeply regretted See's decision to quit after winning the seat on the party's ticket
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He is also fully aware of the commitments, both oral and written, that he had given to PSB before he was selected to be its candidate (for) Batu Lintang," said Wong
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong said that this included an undertaking to compensate the party if See resigned after winning the seat as a PSB candidate, and to resign as an assemblyman as well

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Recently, the Transport Ministry proposed amendments to Section 42 of the Road Transport Act 1987, which would lead to stiffer penalties for illegal racers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Action would also be taken against spectators and parents who allow their children under the age of 18 to join illegal racing activities
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the proposed amendments, Acryl Sani said the Royal Malaysia Police fully supported laws that would be used to effectively curb illegal racing
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                We need a holistic legislative approach to seriously curb illegal racing,” Acryl Sani added

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Illegal racing, which mainly involved underaged riders, not only impacted the racers but also their parents and other road users, he said

                Rushdie, 75, was set to deliver a lecture on artistic freedom at Chautauqua Institution in western New York when police say Matar rushed the stage and stabbed the Indian-born writer, who has lived with a bounty on his head since his 1988 novel “The Satanic Verses” prompted Iran to urge Muslims to kill him

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also countered their criticism of the delays in the project by asking “What about year 2020 (Covid)? Year 2021 (Covid)?”, a period of pandemic lockdowns, when the project was suspended
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also asked why were PH coordinating their efforts to make the LCS project a major issue right before the impending general election

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib said former defence minister Mohamad Sabu and his deputy Liew Chin Tong had previously said it was not the former PH government that ordered the project to stop but that Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) had run out of funds to continue the project
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If this project is not given to BNS owned by LTAT, then who is the next best consortium or company with the right industry experience as well as the necessary construction dockyards to give the project to?” he said

                Lim also asked if the 8.9% growth in the second quarter was a result of private sector consumption and the RM10,000 one-off Employees Provident Fund (EPF) special withdrawals in April
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If so, then growth for the third and fourth quarter may not be so robust since the effect from the expenditure of the RM10,000 one-off EPF special withdrawals amounting to RM44 billion would have greatly dissipated by then,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim said there were also concerns that the strong second quarter numbers were too reliant on domestic demand, especially the EPF withdrawals factor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Since there are no more RM44 billion one-off EPF special withdrawals in the pipeline, Malaysia’s immediate economic growth will depend on external demand – which is subject to slower global growth.” Lim said if the EPF withdrawals were not behind the private sector consumption growth of 18.3%, then BNM should find out what could have led to the surge in the second-quarter numbers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The 18.3% increase in private sector consumption was previously reported as the primary driver for the 8.9% growth in the second quarter

                “I would celebrate the independence day of Sarawak, and we celebrated it grandly in Sibu this year, and I support it.” For Sarawak People’s Aspiration Party (Aspirasi) president Lina Soo, Aug 31, 1957 was the date Malaya was granted independence from Britain, opining that it had nothing to do with Sarawak

                “Historically, Aug 31 had no significance to Sarawak’s independence, and it’s better to be crystal clear about that; better for the understanding and appreciation of the history of Sarawak by all Sarawakians

                About Us Advertise   JAKARTA, Aug 13 ― Indonesian Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto has declared his entry into the country's presidential race in 2024, his third bid for the top job in one of the world's largest democracies

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Speaking late yesterday in front of thousands of members of the Great Indonesia Movement Party, or Gerindra, the former special forces commander accepted its nomination and said he was ready for the presidential bid

                “This law should be implemented immediately to show transparency and accountability in political governance.” He said that a memorandum on the bill was expected to be presented to the Cabinet in September for approval prior to the next Parliament sitting in October

                "Is Malaysia’s stronger than expected 2022 second-quarter growth of 8.9 per cent due to the extraordinary increase in private sector consumption and investment of 18.3 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively following the one-off Employees Provident Fund (EPF) special withdrawals of RM10,000 disbursed in April 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, Malaysia was announced to have recorded a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2022 when compared to the same quarter in 2021
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim noted that private sector consumption in Malaysia only grew by 5.5 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022, in contrast to the 18.9 per cent year-on-year growth in the second quarter of 2022
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "If the RM44 billion from the RM10,000 one-off special EPF withdrawal did not generate the 18.3 per cent jump in private sector consumption for the second quarter, Bank Negara should determine the source of the increase

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim said there was concern about whether Malaysia's second-quarter economic growth is too reliant on firm domestic demand, particularly the RM44 billion one-off special EPF withdrawals
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Since there will be no more RM44 billion one-off EPF special withdrawals in the pipeline, Malaysia’s economic growth will depend on external demand, which is subject to slower global growth," he said

                "So far, two drag circuits have been built, in Terengganu and Melaka," he said when opening the 2022 RXZ Members 4.0 Programme at the Terengganu International Drag Strip in Gong Badak here on Saturday (Aug 13), He said with the facility available, it would give youths the opportunity to participate in motor sports activities through proper channels

                While saying preliminary scrutiny of the related documents did not show any wrongdoing or misappropriation that were within MACC's jurisdiction, he was quoted saying however that the durian plantation project could still be further investigated if new information is available
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                "However, we do not rule out the possibility of continuing further investigations regarding this durian plantation project, if we receive new information that can be related to our jurisdiction," he was quoted saying by Berita Harian

                Shaharom said Kedah MACC had also referred to the special task force's report on the Baling floods before coming to the current conclusion, and added that Kedah MACC would now defer investigations until new information is received

                It also reported DoE director-general Wan Abdul Latiff Wan Jaffar as saying that the Musang King durian plantation has no EIA approval, as the EIA approval given in 2013 was for the planting of rubber trees known as timber latex clones for a forest plantation

                The Malaysian Reserve quoted Presma president Datuk Jawahar Ali Taib Khan saying that the lack of foreign workers has caused 3,000 restaurant operators out of 12,000 registered association members to be closed since the Covid-19 pandemic started more than two years ago
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "The lack of workers has a major impact on the survival of the food service and restaurant industry since the ban on the entry of foreign workers was enforced
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Since the pandemic, in my chain of restaurants alone, more than 250 restaurant workers have returned to India and have not been able to re-enter the country while the mamak restaurant industry needs at least 30,000 more workers to fill vacancies across the country,” Jawahar Ali was quoted saying
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Jawahar Ali said that his association, PPIM and the Malaysian Indian Restaurant Employers Association, as well as Malaysian Muslim Wholesalers and Retailers Association, urged the government to extend the period of hiring foreign workers to October 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Currently, only 30 per cent of the association members received foreign worker approval while 70 per cent of the applications are still in the system,” he said

                “I would celebrate the independence day of Sarawak, and we celebrated it grandly in Sibu this year, and I support it.” For Sarawak People’s Aspiration Party (Aspirasi) president Lina Soo, August 31, 1957 was the date Malaya was granted independence from Britain, opining that it had nothing to do with Sarawak

                John reportedly said Sabah PKR members were hoping for Anwar to resolve the problem of the existence of two camps there — one which was aligned with then Sabah PKR chief Christina Liew, and another one aligned with PKR Keningau division chief Datuk Sangkar Rasam and the latter's nephew and former Sabah PKR youth chief and current Pensiangan PKR division chief Raymond Ahuar
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Anwar on August 6 announced that Sangkar would replace Liew as Sabah PKR chief
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                John reportedly said he was not questioning the decision to change the Sabah PKR chief as it was the PKR president's prerogative to do so, but said this was the "wrong timing" and that the party's focus should instead be on the 15th general election (GE15) which he said was just around the corner
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                These were the only two seats that PKR had won in Sabah in the general elections in 2018, with Liew winning the Tawau seat then

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Liew is currently also the Api-Api state assemblyman and was formerly deputy chief minister of Sabah, and had been a PKR member for the past 20 years and had been the Sabah PKR chief since October 2016

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, Aug 13 — Kuching will be host to the country’s first ever conference on shamanism, to be held from August 25 to 28 at the Borneo Cultures Museum
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Shamanism is an ancient healing tradition and an ancient spiritual practices by indigenous cultures worldwide
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is a cross-cultural spiritual path practiced in every continent of the world
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As all ancient spiritual practices are rooted in nature, shamanism is the method by which human beings can strengthen that natural connection
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is hoped that the conference will increase community awareness, especially on the legal impact of preserving the traditional knowledge and intangible cultural heritage of Sarawak on traditional arts of healing from dying out due to social and religion changes

                Mujibu Muis of Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) said just trying to convince the grassroots of the two parties would be a huge problem as Umno members were more conservative while those in DAP were “liberal and aggressive.” “DAP’s ideology won’t complement Umno’s and vice-versa
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mujibu added that DAP also risked alienating fence-sitters, especially among the professionals, should the party express any intention to join forces with a “party of kleptocrats,” an accusation it had often levelled at Umno
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said voters would not be swayed even if DAP were to cite political stability as a rationale for joining forces with Umno
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If somehow the two parties did form an alliance, it would be shortlived,” he added
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said it would be difficult for such a union to materialise, citing the longstanding rivalry between the two parties
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If they (Umno) find it hard to accept Bersatu and (PKR president) Anwar Ibrahim because of what happened in the past, it would be even more difficult for the grassroots to accept DAP.” Last week, DAP secretary-general Loke Siew Fook implied that cooperation between DAP and Umno might happen after GE15 given the drastic changes in Malaysian politics since the 2018 polls (GE14), and the absence of a single dominant party

                ‘Not a usual writer’ Rushdie published a memoir in 2012 about his cloistered, secretive life under the fatwa called “Joseph Anton,” the pseudonym he used while in British police protection

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sociopolitical analyst Awang Azman Pawi noted that the LCS scandal was being used as a “political weapon” with opposition parties PKR, Amanah and DAP attacking Umno leaders over the issue
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Political analyst James Chin of the University of Tasmania’s Asia Institute said he was sure PH were hoping to capitalise on the LCS controversy  “The opposition is thinking… ‘If we can manage to make the LCS scandal as big as 1MDB, then maybe we can follow the same tactic to get rid of BN’,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “So that’s why everyone is playing up the LCS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The scandal led to BN losing power over the federal government for the first time
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Although the opposition has cast Umno leaders as the villains in the controversy, Awang Azman said PH could have handled the issue better when it was in government (from 2018 to 2020) by forming a royal commission of inquiry or pushing for investigations by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Karl Andersson from the University of Manchester spent three months researching how readers “experience sexual pleasure” when reading Japanese shota comics
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I had hit a wall in my research,” Anderson wrote in the abstract of his 4,000-word article published in the journal Qualitative Research
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “And so I realised that my body was equipped with a research tool of its own that could give me, quite literally, a first-hand understanding of shota.” Andersson, who is originally from Sweden, also concluded that masturbation could be an act of “self-care”, and that the activity was when “we are least alone”
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                The house which belonged to my cousin had been left unoccupied for some time, so he was only too glad to have us move in

                It explained that these projects had been factored in when estimating the ridership for MRT1 and MRT2

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While these projects were slated to bring significant ridership, the development has not yet started, it said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The ridership for the Putrajaya line was also forecast in anticipation of the Bandar Malaysia township, Conlay, Cyberjaya Central and Merdeka 118 projects being completed by the time the line starts operating

                However, Bandar Malaysia development has yet to begin, and the development of Merdeka 118 is still continuing

                Similarly, the urban regeneration along the Putrajaya line such as Titiwangsa, Ampang Park, Chan Sow Lin and the Seri Kembangan corridor has yet to begin

                Penampang assistant registration officer at the birth, death and adoption division of the Sabah JPN, Christine Pamela Eyong, 39, said the certified copies of the birth registration were handed over to MACC after receiving the request by the commission on Feb 12, 2020
