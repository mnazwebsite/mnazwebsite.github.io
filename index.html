                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 — Barisan Nasional was not seeking an early general election to protect its leaders but to “save” Malaysians from being manipulated by the coalition’s rivals, Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He insisted Umno’s increasingly persistent demand for the general election to be held how was wholly unrelated to the criminal cases against BN leaders, which coincidentally included him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While he did not name these rivals, his reference to the 2018 general election indicated that he meant Pakatan Harapan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said the country has faced failure after failure since the May 9, 2018 general election and that this must be prevented from happening again for the country’s sake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid’s Umno has repeatedly urged Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to call for an early general election, but amplified this when Datuk Seri Najib Razak was sent to prison last month after losing his final appeal against his SRC International conviction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The juxtaposition has allowed critics to suggest that Umno’s growing desire for a general election now, before one is due next September, was to prevent more of its so-called “court cluster” from being convicted.

                According to the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), the use of benzoic acid is not declared on the food packaging label of the product - Hand Flower Brand Soy Sauce

            <p>
                "As a precautionary measure, SFA has directed the importer, Heng Yoon Trading Pte Ltd, to recall the implicated product
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The recall is ongoing,” SFA said on its Facebook page late Friday (Sept 2)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the Singapore Food Regulations, SFA said only permitted food additives with levels within the maximum levels are allowed for use in food
            </p>
            
            <p>
                SFA said that a once-off consumption of the affected product is unlikely to be of food safety concern, especially because soy sauce is not a staple food consumed at high levels

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Sept 3 — The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said yesterday that it has ordered the recall of a type of Malaysian-made soy sauce after it detected a type of additive that exceeded the regulatory limit for sauces here

            <p>
                The additive — which it identified as benzoic acid — was not declared on the food packaging of the Hand Flower Brand soy sauce

                Only permitted food additives that are within the imposed maximum levels are allowed for use in food under the Singapore Food Regulations

            <p>
                This is especially because soy sauce is “not a staple food consumed at high levels”, it added

                Premier League • England Juventus have revealed that Liverpool in fact have an option to sign Arthur Melo permanently for over £30million, after talk of a straight loan deal

                Premier League • England Juventus have revealed that Liverpool in fact have an option to sign Arthur Melo permanently for over £30million, after talk of a straight loan deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the various reports about the deal claimed it was a straight-up loan deal with no option to buy for the Premier League club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Serie A side say Liverpool can pay €37.5million (£32.3million) to tie Arthur to a longer-term deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool’s official statement on the signing made no mention of such an arrangement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool will pay most of the player’s wages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As such, while he has not proven himself yet, there is certainly hope at Liverpool that he can

            <p>
                In a notice of appeal filed today at the Court of Appeal, Rosmah said she wanted to appeal against Zaini’s decision yesterday which rejected her application to recuse or remove him from the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the other notice of appeal also filed today at the Court of Appeal, Rosmah said she was dissatisfied with Zaini’s entire decision yesterday in her bribery case, where the judge convicted her and sentenced her to jail and to pay a fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In other words, Rosmah is appealing against both the conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that the total jail time Rosmah could potentially have to serve is 40 years, if she does not succeed in her appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As Rosmah’s lawyers yesterday asked for the 10-year jail sentence and RM970 million fine to be suspended while she pursues an appeal and as the prosecution did not object to the request, the High Court yesterday allowed the suspension or stay of sentence until the Court of Appeal decides on her appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosmah did not have to pay additional bail to avoid being in lock-up while pursuing her appeal, as the High Court allowed the previous RM2 million bail already posted to be extended to serve as her bail until the Court of Appeal decides on her appeal

                What does Huawei have in store for us? CEO Richard Yu gave an interview in which he teased three major features

                First is the XMAGE imaging system, which will be exclusive to the Mate 50 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is the result of years of experience of making some of the best camera phones on the market, even if Huawei no longer has access to Leica’s expertise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rumor has it that the XMAGE system is based on a custom NPU built by HiSilicon instead of relying on the Snapdragon ISP
            </p>

                Sessions Court judge Rozina Ayob made the ruling on Friday (Sept 2) after finding that the prosecution had established a prima facie case on the three graft charges Bung Moktar faces and three abetment charges Zizie faces
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, the judge said she is satisfied that a prima facie case has been established by the prosecution with regards to the charges under Section 28(1)(c) of the MACC Act against Zizie

            <p>
                The judge gave Bung Moktar and Zizie three options — to testify under oath from the witness stand; to give testimony from the accused dock while not under oath, where they cannot be cross-examined; or to choose to remain silent

                Bung Moktar’s lawyer M Athimulan and Zizie’s lawyer Datuk K Kumaraendran, speaking on their clients’ behalf, said the pair will give sworn evidence from the witness stand with the prosecution having an opportunity to cross-examine them

                Asked by Sivananthan, MACC officer Haniff reaffirmed his previous testimony that his investigation was focused on changes to the 1MDB audit report on orders from Najib to Ambrin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Haniff agreed that this meant that the basis of his investigation was based on his understanding that Ambrin had been instructed to make changes to the 1MDB audit report, and agreed this was why he carried out investigations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Haniff agreed that Ambrin’s testimony of making amendments at his own discretion and the claim of instructions being given to Ambrin to make amendments were two different things, also agreeing that Ambrin would have the right as auditor-general then to make any amendments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Later when asked by Najib’s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Haniff agreed that the auditor in this case is the auditor-general Ambrin and his team and that 1MDB is the auditee and has to be represented by actual individuals as it is a company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s and Arul Kanda’s lawyers have during the trial tried to suggest that this may not be the final exit conference

            <p>
                But Haniff today insisted that the December 2015 exit conference was the actual one held, and said a subsequent February 24, 2016 meeting was not an exit conference

                Commenting on a screenshot of a news report on PAS deputy president Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man’s statement that the Islamist party never declared that its partnership with Umno under MN was over, Ahmad Zahid said that the partnership was originally formed out of the urgent need of the two largest parties in Malaysia as a result of the people losing faith in the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government of the time

                The source, who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to media, said it was the first time hard labour had been applied to Suu Kyi's sentencing and was unclear what it would entail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The junta has said Suu Kyi, 77, is being given due process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The military seized power in February 2021 to stop Suu Kyi's NLD from forming a new government after the election that it said had instances of fraud that had not properly been investigated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Suu Kyi has been on trial for more than a year on multiple charges, ranging from corruption and incitement to leaks of official secrets, for which the combined maximum sentences are  more than 190 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A gag order has been imposed on Suu Kyi's lawyers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In June, Myanmar military authorities transferred Suu Kyi to solitary confinement in a prison in the capital Naypyitaw from an undisclosed location

                ■ Turning the Mundane Task of Game Balancing into a Breeze! When we talk about game creation, oftentimes most of us would first picture the arts and game play, essentially the catchiest parts of a game

            <p>
                However, a good game title requires a good game balance to provide a satisfying gameplay experience

            <p>
                Good News! RPG Maker Unite comes with a new feature called “Auto-Guide” that can alleviate this time constraint hurdle in the game creation process!  ■ Convenient and Easy to Use! Simply Enter Some Parameters and Let the System Do the Hard Work! Aimed at helping game creators tuning game balance more easily, it is only natural that the Auto-Guide being super easy to use – and indeed it is!  Initially, simply set some Common Settings parameters such as Max Level, Estimated Clear Level, Max EXP, and Max HP, and the user is largely ready to go! The system will use these values as basis to compute a suggested balance for many parameters common in RPG making!  —Setting some initial parameters for the Auto-Guide to compute and auto-fill parameters such as Enemy Stats! —At the click of a button, enemy stats can be auto-generated using the Auto-Guide! ■ Auto-Guide is Also Available for Setting Class Growth Tendency and Equipment Stats! Auto-Guide also works for auto-setting the parameters for the classes assigned to party members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Simply set some basic, common parameters, and check the box telling the system you want to use Auto-Guide, all values and multipliers are automatically filled for you!  —Using Auto-Guide for battle related skill stats! ■ Addon Manager to Help Control and Manage Modifications! While RPG Maker Unite can be modified directly in the Unity editor via C#, many users have voiced that a feature similar to the Plugin Manager found in previous RPG Maker titles that can switch on and off modifications, is much more convenient and beginner friendly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instructions written by the addon authors are also displayed here too! ■ Developer Log #6 Now Available! In Developer Log #6, we will explain in more details on how to use Auto-Guide will work! If you are curious, please give it a read!

                It was only recently that there was a leak about a new Xbox Game Pass Friends and Family package
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From the official Xbox webpage, the Xbox Game Pass Friends and Family package can add up to five individual accounts (including the primary holder) and each account has its own Xbox profile and games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These five accounts don't need to be in the same household and everyone can play it at the same time, same game as well as playing together
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That said, this new Game Pass is only applicable for gamers who are living in the same country, though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, Microsoft is testing the plan in Ireland and Columbia at the price of €21.99 per month or 49,900 COP per month respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Malaysia, our currency may cost lower since we are paying RM15 per month for the Xbox PC Game Pass. The Xbox Game Pass Friends and Family plan is the same as the Xbox PC Game Pass, which allows gamers to play Xbox games on day one, EA Play membership and others.  For now, this seems to be for Xbox gamers but we hope that it can be implemented for Xbox PC Game Pass for Southeast Asia countries such as ours

                In that match, referee Cuneyt Cakir was sent to the monitor by the VAR to give a penalty but he rejected the overturn and stuck with his original decision

            <p>

                The VAR cannot go against the technology, which is mapped to each pitch individually

            <p>
                The gap between the lines is even clearer on this decision; the attacker has to be offside (watch here.) As with Isak, the offside flag was raised by the assistant and the decision upheld by the VAR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then the VAR didn't advise a penalty when he probably should have, due to the shirt being pulled away from the body
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's a classic example of the referee's decision on the pitch carrying the weight in VAR decisions -- whichever way the referee goes, the VAR wouldn't intervene

            <p>
                The VAR cannot go against the technology, which is mapped to each pitch individually
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The gap between the lines is even clearer on this decision; the attacker has to be offside (watch here.) As with Isak, the offside flag was raised by the assistant and the decision upheld by the VAR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then the VAR didn't advise a penalty when he probably should have, due to the shirt being pulled away from the body
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's a classic example of the referee's decision on the pitch carrying the weight in VAR decisions -- whichever way the referee goes, the VAR wouldn't intervene

            <p>
                On July 25, the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) said it is in the process of applying for Teow to be repatriated to Malaysia to assist in investigations under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating

                On August 9, Teow was supposed to be repatriated to Malaysia but was stopped at the airport as Thai authorities also received an extradition request from the Chinese government

                FROM the depths of crisis to fifth in the Premier League in the space of ten days, Erik Ten Hag’s Manchester United’s have lift-off.  And after Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford continued to fuel this min-revival, can the United duo now earn a place on the plane to Qatar in November?  Sancho netted for the second time in United’s three-match winning run, after a classy assist from Rashford, as United deepened the air of despair around Leicester and piled further pressure on Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers.  Gareth Southgate had claimed that Sancho and Rashford had a long way to go to force their way back into his World Cup plans, as both suffered an alarming plunge in form last season.  Rashford enjoyed a bright first half here but struggled after the break and may still have a lot more convincing to do but he is a favourite of Southgate, who needs more goalscoring options.  And with £82million Antony newly arrived from Ajax, competition for places in the United forward is about to get stiffer.  Transfer deadline has now passed without Cristiano Ronaldo getting away from Old Trafford as well.  So Ten Hag has plenty of options and a certain level of optimism is creeping into a team which was humiliated in that horrific first half at Brentford last month.  The transformative victory over Liverpool, when Sancho and Rashford both scored, has now been followed up by back-to-back away wins.  Yet Leicester were poor, they are a team which looks to have had the lifeblood sucked out of them after a miserable transfer window.

                But United’s opener, midway through the first half, was sweet in its simplicity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a mark of Leicester’s improved threat that Ten Hag brought on Casemiro, in place of winger Anthony Elanga, just before the hour mark.  Maddison, though, was beginning to cause United serious problems and he was wrestled over by Scott McTominay just outside the area but this time his dead-ball effort was charged down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo arrived in place of Sancho midway through the second half and he soon attempted a bicycle kick from an angle, yet duffed his effort wide across goal.

                By Dan Coombs  Manchester United recorded a third straight win by beating Leicester City 1-0 away from home
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The win saw new signing Casemiro come off the bench to make his second appearance for the club, following his debut against Southampton at the weekend

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Casemiro was followed by Cristiano Ronaldo, who also celebrated United’s win at full time with a similar message
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo has had a difficult summer, ending the transfer window as a Manchester United player when he had wanted to leave the club to play Champions League football
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Free of distractions, Ronaldo can now refocus, and manager Erik ten Hag expects more from both him and Casemiro in the weeks ahead

            <p>
                By Dan Coombs  Manchester United recorded a third straight win by beating Leicester City 1-0 away from home
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The win saw new signing Casemiro come off the bench to make his second appearance for the club, following his debut against Southampton at the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He sent out a message celebrating United’s victory, with a big smile on his face after the final whistle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Casemiro was followed by Cristiano Ronaldo, who also celebrated United’s win at full time with a similar message
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo has had a difficult summer, ending the transfer window as a Manchester United player when he had wanted to leave the club to play Champions League football
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Free of distractions, Ronaldo can now refocus, and manager Erik ten Hag expects more from both him and Casemiro in the weeks ahead
            </p>

                @SkylledDev Google has laid out some of what Android fans can expect from the September 2022 Google Play system updates, including improvements to Kids Space on tablets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In recent months, Google has grouped together Play Services, the Play Store, and the “Google Play system updates” introduced in Android 10
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The easiest way to check whether you need to update Google Play Services on your phone is to follow a direct link to the app’s Play Store listing and update from there, if available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To update the Play Store, tap your avatar in the corner, then “Settings.” Under the “About” section, you’ll see an option to “Update Play Store.” Meanwhile, Google Play system updates can be found through the Settings app, under About phone > Android version > Google Play system update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the month of September still a day away from beginning¸ Google has already shared the first batch of Google System Update patch notes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time as these updates were made, Google also added some more information about last month’s Google Play System update

                @SkylledDev Google has laid out some of what Android fans can expect from the September 2022 Google Play system updates, including improvements to Kids Space on tablets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In recent months, Google has grouped together Play Services, the Play Store, and the “Google Play system updates” introduced in Android 10
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The easiest way to check whether you need to update Google Play Services on your phone is to follow a direct link to the app’s Play Store listing and update from there, if available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To update the Play Store, tap your avatar in the corner, then “Settings.” Under the “About” section, you’ll see an option to “Update Play Store.” Meanwhile, Google Play system updates can be found through the Settings app, under About phone > Android version > Google Play system update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the month of September still a day away from beginning¸ Google has already shared the first batch of Google System Update patch notes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time as these updates were made, Google also added some more information about last month’s Google Play System update

                Huawei did reveal the prices, though.

                The Huawei nova 10 and nova 10 Pro launched in China in early July, now the mid-ranger duo is ready to take on Europe
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The exact launch time frame hasn’t been nailed down yet, the company only said to expect the new models to appear at the official Huawei Store “in the coming months”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Huawei did reveal the prices, though.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This one has a 6.67” 120Hz OLED display with a single 60MP ultra wide selfie camera (100°), plus a 4,000mAh battery with 66W fast charging
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This one includes a larger 6.78” 120Hz OLED display, plus an additional 8MP camera on the front

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because of this fancy new Micro-arc Oxidation Coating process employed by Huawei for the new MateBook X Pro (2022), the laptop itself is a little lighter, coming in at just 1.26kg (compared to 1.33kg with the 2021 model)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The display is new and is now a 14.2-inch 3.1K FullView panel with a maximum brightness of 500 nits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Huawei Free Touch is the name of the new touchpad surface, which supports eight innovative gesture controls including screenshots, brightness, and volume adjustment.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Huawei is using a new Shark Fin Fan cooling system, which is said to keep the MateBook X Pro performing admirably for longer sessions

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The display is new and is now a 14.2-inch 3.1K FullView panel with a maximum brightness of 500 nits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Huawei Free Touch is the name of the new touchpad surface, which supports eight innovative gesture controls including screenshots, brightness, and volume adjustment.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Huawei is using a new Shark Fin Fan cooling system, which is said to keep the MateBook X Pro performing admirably for longer sessions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No word yet on pricing or availability for the Huawei MateBook X Pro (2022), but we can be far off from a public release

                In an uncharacteristic move, Liverpool made a deadline day signing, surprising everyone by bringing in 29-year-old Brazilian midfielder Arthur Melo on loan from Juventus
            </p>

                AMD has announced the Ryzen 7000 series desktop processors along with the AM5 socket and the 600-series motherboard chipsets, all set to release on Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD says that compared to Zen 3, Zen 4 brings 13 per cent instruction per clock (IPC) uplift on average, resulting in a 29 per cent single-thread performance gain over the Ryzen 5000 series
            </p>

                AMD says that the Ryzen 7000 series processors are not only faster but also more power efficient

            <p>
                Zen 4’s AVX-512 instruction support is a first for AMD processors

            </p>
            
            <p>
                These Ryzen 7 processors are priced just above the current retail pricing of the 12-core Intel Core i7-12700K and the 10-core Core i5-12600K

                This wearable private display, as Lenovo puts it, is very much like other consumer smart glasses, including TCL’s NxtWear Air, which puts two 1080p micro-OLED screens in front of your eyes, just like Lenovo’s T1

                Lenovo is betting that mobile gamers will want these glasses, too, citing a Global Industry Analysts report that predicts a $160 billion global market for that industry by 2026

                If you’d like to use the glasses with iOS devices like your iPhone, you’ll have to buy Lenovo’s HDMI adapter, as well as Apple’s Digital AV adapter — all because Apple still hasn’t moved on from its 10-year-old Lightning port

                Here's all the biggest iPhone 14 leaks before launch The iPhone 14 is all set to be unveiled on September 7 at Apple’s Far Out event, and this promises to be the biggest iPhone launch in years.  We’re talking huge upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro series, a rumored new iPhone 14 Max model to replace the mini and more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But you should be ready to pay more, as Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says Apple will charge $100 more for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So you’d be looking at $1,100 to $1,200 for the new Pro iPhones
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Early iPhone 14 rumors said that the iPhone 14 Pro would have two cutouts towards the two of the display
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Here's all the biggest iPhone 14 leaks before launch The iPhone 14 is all set to be unveiled on September 7 at Apple’s Far Out event, and this promises to be the biggest iPhone launch in years.  We’re talking huge upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro series, a rumored new iPhone 14 Max model to replace the mini and more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But you should be ready to pay more, as Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says Apple will charge $100 more for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So you’d be looking at $1,100 to $1,200 for the new Pro iPhones
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Early iPhone 14 rumors said that the iPhone 14 Pro would have two cutouts towards the two of the display

                The next version of USB could be one of the fastest connectors we’ve seen yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The USB Promoter Group says that USB 4 version 2.0 will be capable of speeds up to 80 Gbps, double what the original USB 4, and even Thunderbolt 4, are capable of
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joe Balich, a spokesperson for the USB-IF, confirmed that if I were to go out and buy a USB 4 cable right now that was rated for 40 Gbps, it would be able to do twice those speeds in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                USB has always been good about backward compatibility (and USB 4 version 2 is no exception), but being able to use the same cable and still reap the flagship benefit of the new spec is another level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the USB Promoter Group, which is made up of companies like Intel, Apple, Microsoft, HP, and Texas Instruments, the USB-C and power delivery specs will be updated to “enable this higher level of data performance.” The USB 4 version 2.0 specification will also apparently include updates that provide better speeds when you’re using USB 3.2 — the promotors group promises over 20 Gbps — as well as improved support for DisplayPort and PCIe since it’ll be using the latest version of those standards (the first USB 4 only let you use DisplayPort 1.4a when “tunneling,” or carrying DisplayPort and USB signals at the same time)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s a strange move to label this as just a “version 2.0” of USB 4 when the leap in speed definitely feels like it’d warrant being called USB 5

                The first thing to know about the Leica Cine 1 projector is that there are actually two of them in development, both using Leica lenses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leica notes that each projector is tuned for each display size and doesn’t recommend moving them closer or further from the wall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                USTs look best with ambient light rejection (ALR) screens, which Leica will also be happy to sell you for about $1,800 for a big screen or around $1,600 for an 80-inch screen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 100-inch Cine 1 model is expected to sell for $7,900, while the 80-inch projector will probably cost around $6,900, according to Slavov

            <p>
                Yes, that’s expensive for these specs, but this is Leica
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leica is hoping the projector ships with 4.2 Atmos-certified audio

                The first thing to know about the Leica Cine 1 projector is that there are actually two of them in development, both using Leica lenses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leica notes that each projector is tuned for each display size and doesn’t recommend moving them closer or further from the wall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                USTs look best with ambient light rejection (ALR) screens, which Leica will also be happy to sell you for about $1,800 for a big screen or around $1,600 for an 80-inch screen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 100-inch Cine 1 model is expected to sell for $7,900, while the 80-inch projector will probably cost around $6,900, according to Slavov
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yes, that’s expensive for these specs, but this is Leica
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leica is hoping the projector ships with 4.2 Atmos-certified audio

                The Elite 5 are equipped to handle your voice chats, help reduce distractions and offer a list of other handy tools — all for $150.  The Elite 5 has a similar design to Jabra's other recent earbuds

                This compact stature means each option offers a more comfy fit, and that's true of the Elite 5 too

                The water resistance is the same as the cheaper Elite 3 at IP55, but the case for the Elite 5 supports wireless charging like the pricier Elite 7 Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lastly, multipoint connectivity is available on the Elite 5, so you can link up to multiple devices simultaneously.  As you make your way up Jabra's Elite line, the features get better with each model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Elite 5 sits squarely in the middle, with slightly more than the Elite 3 and slightly less than the Elite 7 Pro

                Jabra is offering the Elite 7 Pro for $130 for a limited time, which matches the lowest price we've seen

                The Elite 5 are equipped to handle your voice chats, help reduce distractions and offer a list of other handy tools — all for $150.  The Elite 5 has a similar design to Jabra's other recent earbuds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This compact stature means each option offers a more comfy fit, and that's true of the Elite 5 too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The water resistance is the same as the cheaper Elite 3 at IP55, but the case for the Elite 5 supports wireless charging like the pricier Elite 7 Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lastly, multipoint connectivity is available on the Elite 5, so you can link up to multiple devices simultaneously.  As you make your way up Jabra's Elite line, the features get better with each model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Elite 5 sits squarely in the middle, with slightly more than the Elite 3 and slightly less than the Elite 7 Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jabra is offering the Elite 7 Pro for $130 for a limited time, which matches the lowest price we've seen

                At IFA 2022, Jabra is announcing the new $149 Elite 5 earbuds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the design, Jabra says they’ll provide “a discreet, comfortable, and compact fit.” The earbuds share a teardrop shape that’s similar to the rest of the current Elite series and have six mics onboard for enhanced voice call performance with wind suppression
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you’re a little mixed up on where Jabra’s current lineup stands — this company sure makes a lot of earbuds — here’s how it looks with today’s addition of the Elite 5
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s a lot of products in similar pricing territory — especially when you consider how often Jabra’s earbuds are on sale

                It still feels a little crowded to me, but the Elite 5 earbuds do offer a nice balance of features for the price

                The video wastes no time and starts by showing off the last few steps in the production cycle of the Galaxy Z Fold 4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can watch the video below

            <p>
                After Samsung is done with the rudimentary tests, the firm moves towards durability tests on the Galaxy Z Fold 4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first test checks the water resistance using a specialized chamber
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Devices that survive this test are then sent to the folding test bench where a robotic arm is responsible for folding and unfolding the phone so it can rule out any issues with the folding mechanism or the hinge itself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is another specialized robot that is responsible for testing the side keys by pressing them repeatedly and the entire testing process ends with another water resistance test where the nozzles spray water at high pressure at unfolded Galaxy Z Fold 4 from all the angles and once that is done, the phone is completely submerged
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the video does not show the Galaxy Z Flip 4 going through the same test, it does appear in the last water resistance test, which is enough reason for us to believe that Samsung is treating both phones the same way, and is pretty confident in the durability of these devices

                While Halo Infinite players are desperate for fresh content, the long-awaited Forge beta has also now been delayed and will launch on November 8th alongside the co-op mode
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was hugely popular in previous Halo games, and leaks have shown that Forge in Halo Infinite looks like it will be a lot of fun for players
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Players have been complaining about the XP system in Halo Infinite ever since its launch, and the new winter update will include new ways to earn XP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Halo Infinite will also get a much-needed in-game reporting system to allow players to report cheaters easily
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Forge will be a big test for Halo Infinite, particularly after the game’s delayed release and continued seasonal delays
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These next Halo Infinite releases appear to be tackling the feedback head-on

                While Halo Infinite players are desperate for fresh content, the long-awaited Forge beta has also now been delayed and will launch on November 8th alongside the co-op mode
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was hugely popular in previous Halo games, and leaks have shown that Forge in Halo Infinite looks like it will be a lot of fun for players
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Players have been complaining about the XP system in Halo Infinite ever since its launch, and the new winter update will include new ways to earn XP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Halo Infinite will also get a much-needed in-game reporting system to allow players to report cheaters easily
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Forge will be a big test for Halo Infinite, particularly after the game’s delayed release and continued seasonal delays
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These next Halo Infinite releases appear to be tackling the feedback head-on

                Google older CPU's were made and designed by Quallcom; and now tensor is designed by google and executed by Samsung

            <p>
                It's probably because the iPhones have the same CPU while Google still have pixels phones with Snapdragon and tensor, when all Google phones will be powered by tensor,all pixel phones will get the updates in the same time, like Apple

                Google older CPU's were made and designed by Quallcom; and now tensor is designed by google and executed by Samsung
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's probably because the iPhones have the same CPU while Google still have pixels phones with Snapdragon and tensor, when all Google phones will be powered by tensor,all pixel phones will get the updates in the same time, like Apple
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Georgi, 3 hours agoProbably it's not very easy for Samsung or Google to send these updates in the same time ..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also Google has pixel phones powered by Snapdragon and tensor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When all Google phones will be powered by tensor,it will be a different story

                Not only has HMD Global presented new Nokia smartphones today, but it has also introduced a new Android-powered tablet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, the UNISOC Tiger T610 in the T20 has made way for the UNISOC Tiger T612, which HMD Global complements with at least 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While HMD Global has included a relatively large battery, the Nokia T21 is only 7.5 mm thick and weighs approximately 465 g
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to HMD Global, the tablet will be compatible with Wacom Active ES 2.0 styluses, rather than a proprietary alternative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                HMD Global adds that a version with 128 GB of storage and LTE connectivity is coming to market, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As usual, HMD Global promises to provide two years of software updates for the Nokia T21, which should end when the company rolls out Android 14

                Sawan, a Canadian national who previously headed Shell's oil and gas production business and today oversees Shell's growth into low carbon energies as well as its giant gas business, is seen as the front-runner to succeed van Beurden but no decision has been made, one source said

            <p>
                In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the collapse in energy demand in early 2020, van Beurden and his board decided to cut Shell's dividend, the world's largest at the time at around $15 billion, for the first time since World War Two

                Refreshed ‌iPad Pro‌ models have been rumored for some time, and now, Australian carrier Optus has added ‌2022 iPad Pro‌ models to its internal stock keeping system, distinct from 2021 ‌iPad Pro‌ models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At present, there is no fourth-generation 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, with the latest model from 2021 being a third-generation model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Optus staff, the ‌2022 ‌iPad‌ Pro‌ models are not currently in stock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One such customer told MacRumors that two days after receiving order confirmation for the ‌2022 ‌iPad‌ Pro‌ model, they were contacted by a customer service representative who said that the fourth-generation 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ was out of stock, and that Optus could only offer the third-generation 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ at the current time – resulting in the creation of a new order confirmation for the 2021 model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is approximately $200 ($137 USD) more than the $1,899 price of the current equivalent ‌iPad Pro‌ model in Australia

                If you were thinking of upgrading from the original Razer Kishi or iOS controller, then there are a few benefits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Compatibility for phones and connections aside, the design for both the Android and iOS Kishi V2 is nearly identical
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We noted in our review of the Kishi V2 for Android that while those mechanical buttons impressed on the Wolverine V2, on this smaller controller, a lack of travel makes them less impressive on the Kishi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The review also notes that the Kishi V2’s performance falls flat against a competing Lightning-only product, the $99 Backbone One
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Razer appears to have taken some hefty inspiration from its competition when designing the second generation of Kishi mobile controllers, though that mattered less for the Kishi V2 for Android as Backbone’s offering was designed for iOS users
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kishi V2 for iPhone requires iOS 15.4 or later and is compatible with models from the iPhone SE (first- and second-gen) through to the iPhone 13 series

                Earlier today, the Twitter account seen below published the two images depicting a prominent character from Assassin's Creed Mirage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What we can potentially glean from these images is that the new Assassin's Creed game might feature a quest called "The Forty Thieves." From the depiction of the quest in the new artwork, it seems this is a DLC quest, perhaps even a pre-order bonus for Ubisoft's upcoming game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either way, it could well be the case that both Assassin's Creed Mirage and this new Forty Thieves quest are unveiled by Ubisoft next week

            <p>
                The company is scheduled to hold a presentation on Saturday, September 10, and it's this event that's been heralded as unveiling the "future of Assassin's Creed." We can hardly think of a more convenient event for Mirage's grand debut.  There's also a rumoured stealth-focused Assassin's Creed spin-off game in the works from Ubisoft, which could be separate from Mirage.  Hirun Cryer is a freelance reporter and writer with Gamesradar+ based out of U.K

                The new TCL 6-Series R655 supports a 144Hz refresh rate for PC gamers While TCL didn’t have much to show us back at CES, the makers of the competitively priced TCL 6-Series say that it’s got a new model for 2022 that gamers are going to love
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you haven’t heard of the TCL 6-Series before now, it’s a model that carries some serious clout in the AV community for its performance that punches well above its price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previous iterations of the TV — the TCL R625 and TCL R635 — continue to be strong picks for people who want a solid value TV, but the new R655 should offer improved performance compared to the previous versions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That being said, without having seen the new TCL R655 series for ourselves it’s hard to say how well it carries on that tradition

                TCL finally made a Roku TV with excellent gaming specs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One year, there’s a Roku version; the next year, we get a Google TV edition, and now, TCL is upgrading the Roku model again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the 2022 6-Series Roku TV, TCL is putting a big emphasis on gaming capabilities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the bottom of the screen, there’s now an ambient light sensor, and this addition allowed TCL to include Dolby Vision IQ on the 2022 6-Series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The built-in voice microphones from the Google TV 6-Series aren’t present on the new Roku model, but you can still use the included remote for voice commands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But now, the latest Roku version has leapfrogged that set with the upgrade to 144Hz VRR; I can’t help but predict that general navigation on the Roku 6-Series will be more fluid and snappy than on Google TV

                The built-in voice microphones from the Google TV 6-Series aren’t present on the new Roku model, but you can still use the included remote for voice commands

            <p>
                But now, the latest Roku version has leapfrogged that set with the upgrade to 144Hz VRR; I can’t help but predict that general navigation on the Roku 6-Series will be more fluid and snappy than on Google TV

                If you thought that Sony delayed the Xperia 5 IV until now to wait for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 to make its debut, you thought wrong

                Where Sony usually shines though is the cameras, and with the Sony Xperia 5 IV, you’ll find a triple rear camera system

                The Xperia 5 IV also now comes with wireless charging as well as reverse wireless charging, features that were previously missing in the Xperia 5 III

                Last year’s Sony Xperia 5 III meanwhile retailed in Malaysia for RM4,599 and we can probably expect to see a similar price tag when it does arrive in Malaysia later this year.

                “That’s why, as we’ve said before, we are committed to making the same version of Call of Duty available on PlayStation on the same day the game launches elsewhere.” Spencer likens Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal to the company’s $2.5 billion acquisition of Minecraft

                Well, at the end of its Ryzen 7000 Series launch AMD gave the press a very, very small teaser of the architecture, and of its endeavours within the Radeon division
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The small nugget of information about RDNA3 – again, we cannot stress just how minor the details were – GPU architecture was basically Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, giving a small update about the progress the Radeon division has made
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Design-wise, the RDA3 GPU will be using AMD’s new chiplet design
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD officially confirmed during its Financial Analyst Day 2022 back in June that its RDNA3 technology was on track for launch this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Much like the Ryzen 7000 Series, the new GPU and its “Advanced Chiplet Packaging” will be based on the 5nm die lithography, undoubtedly provided by TSMC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, the GPU will also feature a “next generation” Infinity Cache

                Well, at the end of its Ryzen 7000 Series launch AMD gave the press a very, very small teaser of the architecture, and of its endeavours within the Radeon division
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The small nugget of information about RDNA3 – again, we cannot stress just how minor the details were – GPU architecture was basically Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, giving a small update about the progress the Radeon division has made
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Design-wise, the RDA3 GPU will be using AMD’s new chiplet design
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD officially confirmed during its Financial Analyst Day 2022 back in June that its RDNA3 technology was on track for launch this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Much like the Ryzen 7000 Series, the new GPU and its “Advanced Chiplet Packaging” will be based on the 5nm die lithography, undoubtedly provided by TSMC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, the GPU will also feature a “next generation” Infinity Cache
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                The publisher did express that DLC for single-player titles on PC, such as Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, Assassin’s Creed III (2012 release), Far Cry 3 and Splinter Cell Blacklist, will still be available to download and keep before the decommission date
            </p>

                Lenovo kicked off IFA 2022 with two tablets and the second generation of its folding laptop - the ThinkPad X1 Fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's a big improvement over the first-gen 13.3-inch X1 Fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can use the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 as a 16.3-inch free-standing monitor with a Bluetooth keyboard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can, of course, use the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 as a huge tablet if you wish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 weighs 1.28kg for the display only, and 1.9kg with the keyboard and stand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lenovo will ask $2,499 for the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 when it begins shipping in November

            <p>
                Lenovo kicked off IFA 2022 with two tablets and the second generation of its folding laptop - the ThinkPad X1 Fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's a big improvement over the first-gen 13.3-inch X1 Fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can use the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 as a 16.3-inch free-standing monitor with a Bluetooth keyboard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can, of course, use the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 as a huge tablet if you wish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 weighs 1.28kg for the display only, and 1.9kg with the keyboard and stand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lenovo will ask $2,499 for the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 when it begins shipping in November

                For now, two devices (and they’re not even the new Nokia phones) will join Circular; The Nokia XR20 will cost £20 (roughly $23) per month with a £30 (around $35) setup fee

                There is also the Nokia T10 LTE, an entry-level 8-inch tablet, for £10 (roughly $12) a month with the same £30 (around $35) setup fee

                Liverpool made it back-to-back wins at Anfield after Fabio Carvalho scored deep into stoppage time to beat Newcastle 2-1 draw…after we fell behind first, again, mind
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thankfully, a few of the kids are alright!  Two years without a league goal at Anfield you say? It was never in doubt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the game approached the hour mark, Liverpool hadn’t even had a shot on target and were again trailing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Take a look around the rest of the Premier League – it isn’t restricted to Anfield and it’s an absolute horror aspect of the top flight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And you know what? It’s an absolute delight to see the game won deep into injury time as a result

                Liverpool made it back-to-back wins at Anfield after Fabio Carvalho scored deep into stoppage time to beat Newcastle 2-1 draw…after we fell behind first, again, mind
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thankfully, a few of the kids are alright!  Two years without a league goal at Anfield you say? It was never in doubt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the game approached the hour mark, Liverpool hadn’t even had a shot on target and were again trailing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Take a look around the rest of the Premier League – it isn’t restricted to Anfield and it’s an absolute horror aspect of the top flight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And you know what? It’s an absolute delight to see the game won deep into injury time as a result

                Chiyaan Vikram starrer 'Cobra' is one of the biggest and most-awaited releases in Tamil cinema this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This movie has marked the fourth-highest opening day collection for a Tamil film on the first day in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Though this film emerged as the biggest opening in Chiyaan Vikram's career, the lengthy timing didn't sit well with the filmgoers on the first day of the release
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cobra's initial theatrical runtime was 3 hours 3 minutes and 3 seconds
            </p>

            <p>
                When I talk with her, I always laugh out loud to the point that I’m rolling over with laughter.”  Joo Hyun Young also shared, “Every time [Park Eun Bin] finished one scene, everyone would give a standing ovation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A new season of ‘SNL’ will start soon, but I’m at a loss for what to do then.”  Finally, Joo Hyun Young revealed that unlike her current image, she was actually a quiet student back in her school days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to those people that I attended school with, I was very soft-spoken and had an image of a gentle student.” Joo Hyun Young’s full interview and pictorial will be available through the September issue of @star1

                For starters, the telco has confirmed it will not invest in DNB just like what has been claimed by the Reuters report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DNB yesterday said that two out of six local telcos have pulled out from the shareholder agreement even though they have previously agreed to participate in it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Through the same statement, the company also said that its ability to deliver 5G service will not be affected by this decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because the 5G access is under a separate agreement altogether that has no link to the DNB’s equity agreement which is something that has been confirmed yesterday by the national 5G company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The telco has further confirmed that it is currently in the process of finalising the access agreement with DNB although no actual timeline was mentioned in today’s statement

                Much like the 55-inch Play lightstrip explicitly made for TVs, the PC versions of the Play lightstrips provide flexible accent lighting that attaches to the back of your monitor

            <p>
                The Play lightstrips for PC will be compatible with the existing Hue Sync desktop app and can work with the Play Sync box from Philips Hue, just like the larger lightstrips used with TVs, but they don’t require it

                Rosmah Mansor, wife of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, arrives at the Kuala Lumpur Court Complex to attend a verdict hearing in a corruption case against her, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia September 1, 2022

                The Xperia 5 IV is official and with it, Sony's 2022 phone lineup is complete
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sony kept the small stature of the Xperia 5 series, but added some big-phone features and a big-phone price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Physically, the Xperia 5 IV is almost the same size as the Xperia 5 III - the IV is even 1mm shorter and narrower, but 4g heavier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sony Xperia 5 IV in Black, Ecru White, and Green Despite the unchanged size Sony managed to fit in a 10% larger battery, bringing the Xperia 5 IV to 5,000mAh, on par with the Xperia 1 IV and Xperia 10 IV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for charging Sony promises the Xperia 5 IV can go up to 50% on a 30-minute charge with a 30W PD charger
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A bigger battery and wireless charging Sony went conventional with the Xperia 5 IV's camera setup

                (Pocket-lint) - Samsung has announced the Galaxy Tab Active 4 Pro tablet, designed to be tough enough to use outside of the office, wherever you might fancy working
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tablet features MIL-STD-810H military-grade toughness and Samsung claims it is "tough enough to endure even the most demanding work environments"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Did someone say beach working? - The Galaxy Tab Active 4 Pro offers a 10.2mm frame, weighs 674g and it features Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There's a replaceable 7600mAh battery on board, as well as fast charging, and there's also a No Battery Mode that allows the tablet to be used continuously at a kiosk or in a vehicle without the battery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 4 Pro runs on Android 12.0 out of the box and Samsung will offer five years of security updates and three years of OS updates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Galaxy Tab Active 4 Pro will be available starting September in parts of Europe, with availability in Asia, Latin America, North America and the Middle East to follow later this year

                The Sony HT-A3000 also has built-in dual subwoofers and three front speakers, giving it 3.1 channels

                This is where this new soundbar differs from the preceding HT-A5000, which is a 5.1.2 channel soundbar

            <p>
                Chengdu recorded 157 new local infections on Thursday, of which 51 displayed no symptoms, the city government said in a separate notice

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Japanese brand hasn't explicitly revealed the name of the new smartphone, but it's likely the Sony Xperia 5 IV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Sony Xperia 5 IV is rumored to come with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC and sport a triple camera setup on the rear comprising three 12MP units (primary, telephoto, ultrawide)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Xperia 5 IV is expected to feature a 6.1" screen protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and pack a battery bigger than the Xperia 5 III's 4,500 mAh cell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We'll know all about the Sony Xperia 5 IV once the event concludes, so check our homepage for more on the new smartphone
            </p>

                Sony, motorola and asus do not have.

            <p>
                Keeping this in mind, it is not unreasonable for Apple to price the iPhone 14 between $699-$749.  Similarly, the iPhone 14 Max, is likely to be priced between $799-$849

                Darwin Nunez endured a nightmare home debut for Liverpool when he was dismissed for violent conduct against Crystal Palace and received a three-match domestic suspension Liverpool fans were hoping for a goal in front of the Kop when Darwin Nunez made his Anfield debut against Crystal Palace last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez could do with listening to Luis Suarez's advice

            <p>
                Do you think Darwin Nunez will be a success at Liverpool? Let us know in the comments below! "With what happened to him the other day I was talking to him because he is just starting out and to make him aware that from now on, opponents will be seeking him out twice or three times more often," said Suarez after Nunez's headbutt last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wednesday narrow win shows how much Liverpool need a prolific scorer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez must have a similar impact if Liverpool are going to challenge for honours this term

                Darwin Nunez endured a nightmare home debut for Liverpool when he was dismissed for violent conduct against Crystal Palace and received a three-match domestic suspension Liverpool fans were hoping for a goal in front of the Kop when Darwin Nunez made his Anfield debut against Crystal Palace last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez could do with listening to Luis Suarez's advice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Do you think Darwin Nunez will be a success at Liverpool? Let us know in the comments below! "With what happened to him the other day I was talking to him because he is just starting out and to make him aware that from now on, opponents will be seeking him out twice or three times more often," said Suarez after Nunez's headbutt last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wednesday narrow win shows how much Liverpool need a prolific scorer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez must have a similar impact if Liverpool are going to challenge for honours this term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool fans will hope their former star is right

                The first major upgrade on the new X1 Fold is a bigger 16.3-inch OLED display from Sharp

                More info Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp recently admitted that he would be keen to take more risks in the transfer market and left the door open for a late summer swoop

                Arsenal emerged as the key candidates to snap him up, but the Gunners' hesitancy suggests that they may hold fire until next year when they could land him for free.  Liverpool still have time to punish them by meeting the Foxes' £25million asking price on deadline day with speculation ramping up that Tielemans could be on his way out of the King Power Stadium

                That could pave the way for Douglas Luiz to leave Villa Park if the right offer comes in, three years after signing from Manchester City.  The Brazilian would be welcomed by compatriots like Fabinho and Roberto Firmino if he moved to Anfield on deadline day with Klopp on the lookout for midfield options
            </p>

                Talk of a £20m bid is yet to emerge into anything concrete although things could accelerate as the 11pm deadline closes in.     Klopp is generally keen to explore the best talent his homeland has to offer and many feel as though Laimer would be a good option for the Reds

                Despite the move being long overdue, only certain Android phones [PDF] from brands such as HONOR, Huawei, Xiaomi, Nokia, Samsung, and Vivo currently support the telco’s new feature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Celcom sub-brand had enabled Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) just earlier this year for both Android and iOS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For VoWiFi though, Yoodo decided to roll out the feature for Android users first, saying that support for iPhones will be coming later on but the company did not give a timeline for when this might happen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To enable VoWiFi on a supported phone, you need to go into the settings, tap on the Mobile Network, go into the Mobile Data section, and there should be a Wi-Fi Calling or VoWiFi option there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its parent company, Celcom, similarly took a while to roll out VoWiFi to its users, enabling the feature in June earlier this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even though it is one of the country’s major telcos, Celcom also had a gap between implementing VoWiFi for Android and iOS, with iPhone support coming in almost two months after the feature’s initial debut on its network
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unfortunately, Yoodo says that the feature currently cannot be used while roaming

                Not to be confused with their predecessors, Lenovo is launching the Tab P11 (2nd Gen) and Tab P11 Pro (2nd Gen)

                Despite the fact that the P11 (2nd Gen) won't arrive until early 2023, this is the first tablet to be announced with Android 12L onboard

                Considering that Lenovo's Tab P12 Pro was one of the only tablets available for the Android 12L developer preview and Android 13 Beta Program, it makes perfect sense to see at least one of Lenovo's latest tablets equipped with the tablet-centric operating system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the P11 Pro (2nd Gen), you won't have to wait much longer as Lenovo states the 11.2-inch tablet will be available sometime in September

                For just $30 more, the new Kobo Clara 2E brings better screen lighting that’s easier on the eyes, plus two important upgrades that should put a dent in the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 5's dominance

            <p>
                The other major upgrade for the Kobo Clara 2E is the addition of Bluetooth, allowing wireless headphones, a wireless speaker, or a wireless connection to a car’s stereo to be used for enjoying audiobook content, which can be downloaded right to the e-reader itself from Kobo’s online store
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kobo also points out that the new Clara 2E’s housing is made from more than 85 percent recycled plastic; 10% of which is (was?) ocean-bound plastic
            </p>

                Lenovo doesn't say how much battery life to expect from the 7,700mAh cell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This slate ships with Android 12L, the tablet-specific version of Android 12, and should eventually get an upgrade to Android 14

            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is how the company “invented” the notch, which is a cutout at the top of the screen where all these sensors, plus a microphone and speaker, are placed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, the company relocated the top speaker of the iPhone 13 to make the notch smaller, but it’s still there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This new report claims that Apple will make the two separate cutouts on the iPhone 14 Pro’s screen look like a single cutout
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regular iPhone 14 models are expected to keep the same notch as the iPhone 13

                By Dan Coombs  Sergino Dest is set to clinch a move to AC Milan after Manchester United backed away from a potential move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, The Athletic reported yesterday that United had decided not to move for Dest, electing to keep Aaron Wan-Bissaka as back-up right-back instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He says a loan deal with an option to buy is agreed, and Dest is now set to fly to Milan to seal the move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dest will sign until June 2027, one year loan plus potential four year deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s unclear whether United decided not to sign Dest simply because they did not want to, or because there was no buyer for Aaron Wan-Bissaka
            </p>

                Even sending Wan-Bissaka on loan and then landing Dest on loan would have felt fairly pointless

                Jurgen Klopp’s injury woes are finally starting to ease after a challenging start to the season for Liverpool, with a number of players returning to training this week Liverpool experienced a horrendous start to the new season and saw 10 players injured following their first three games of the campaign, but things are finally starting to look up for Jurgen Klopp’s men

                The 23-year-old picked up the injury following the 1-1 draw with Ukraine on June 14, before feeling the same problem again once he returned to Liverpool’s training base for pre-season

                In KOTA KINABALU, a woman who was last seen walking back from a restaurant to her house in Inanam early yesterday morning had been found dead in a drain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 50-something woman was at the restaurant in Gaya Utama Inanam at about 2am
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kota Kinabalu Deputy OCPD Supt Kalsom Idris said the restaurant owner told police that the woman had decided to walk home alone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A check on the victim’s body later found no (sign) of foul play,” Supt Kalsom said, adding that police are investigating the cause of death.

                Elden Ring wasn’t just a hit with fans of FromSoftware’s notoriously difficult action-RPGs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today’s announcement from FromSoft’s parent company Kadokawa revealed that Sony and Tencent are acquiring 14.09% and 16.25% of FromSoft, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement indicates that Kadokawa wants FromSoftware to be able to expand its development efforts; Kadokawa sees the “enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment of [FromSoft] game IP as one of the [Kadokawa] Group’s highest priorities.” One of the aims is to give FromSoft the resources needed to grow Elden Ring into a franchise that extends beyond just video games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elden Ring was a long time coming, built on a foundation first laid down in FromSoftware’s pioneering 2009 PS3 game Demon’s Souls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It owns 5% of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry publisher Ubisoft, completed an acquisition of League of Legends’ developer Riot Games, owns 40% of Epic Games, and has stakes in many, many, many, many other game companies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sony has also been on a spending spree too, though it looks a bit more modest compared to Tencent

                According to 9to5Google, these widgets will also come in with a new welcome screen for ChromeOS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also, seeing as Google appears to be much further into its development process, the company is now calling the new page a "welcome screen" for ChromeOS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As far as navigating out of the welcome screen, it seems it'll disappear as soon as you click on one of your apps to start your session
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, as 9to5 notes, Google apparently isn't sure just yet how to bring back the welcome screen after you've clicked out of it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While we're still most likely a ways away from seeing this new welcome screen, 9to5 states there should be a new flag coming to the Chromium Gerrit that will allow eager testers to try out the new change before it releases

                According to 9to5Google, these widgets will also come in with a new welcome screen for ChromeOS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also, seeing as Google appears to be much further into its development process, the company is now calling the new page a "welcome screen" for ChromeOS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As far as navigating out of the welcome screen, it seems it'll disappear as soon as you click on one of your apps to start your session
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, as 9to5 notes, Google apparently isn't sure just yet how to bring back the welcome screen after you've clicked out of it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While we're still most likely a ways away from seeing this new welcome screen, 9to5 states there should be a new flag coming to the Chromium Gerrit that will allow eager testers to try out the new change before it releases

                Rafizi was responding to questions on his reaction to being called up by the police to give his statement following his accusation linking Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Special Functions) Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad to alleged financial misconduct in relation to the RM9 billion LCS procurement
            </p>

                He had earlier asked the police to launch an investigation into the scandal but was met with a counter-complaint filed by an aide of Dr Abdul Latiff, who is also the Mersing MP, yesterday for alleged defamation

            <p>

                Some of the worst losses we got using the Weatherlight Aggro deck we used in the middle of our stream came against Mono-Red Aggro (also known as Big Red amongst some of the players of the last decade)

                This card is going to make a big splash in the format and likely others as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is evidenced by the sheer mass of copies of this card that we encountered during the event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, our own Weatherlight Aggro deck, shown below, did well with the card too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our second takeaway comes from our utilization of our Spellthief Midrange deck
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some of the worst losses we got using the Weatherlight Aggro deck we used in the middle of our stream came against Mono-Red Aggro (also known as Big Red amongst some of the players of the last decade)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When we made our own monocolor deck, a Mono-White Weenie deck, we won quite a bit but the same result occurred against Big Red

                Apple is cutting one iPhone model (the mini) and adding one (the vanilla Max), so a shake-up in the pricing structure is to be expected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, last year there was the iPhone 13 mini for $700 as the cheapest new (non-SE) model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This year you will be looking to spend $750 or $800 for a new mainline iPhone at the least, if the predictions pan out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Analysts agree that the new iPhone 14 Max will cost $100 more than the vanilla model, which will put its price at $850 or $900, depending on exactly which analysts are right
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no consensus on whether it’s by $50 or by $100 (TrendForce says $50), but that new hardware doesn’t come cheap
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The vanilla iPhone 14 and 14 Max won’t even get the new chipset (if the rumors are to be believed)

            <p>
                Finally, the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED can be used as a conventional laptop with a magnetically-attachable physical keyboard and only half of its display at 12.5-inch and 1920x1280px.

            <p>
                The Zenbook 17 Fold OLED runs on Windows 11 and is powered by Intel's i7-1250U processor with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM

                First announced during CES 2022, Asus has now officially revealed the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED, a giant touchscreen tablet that can be folded down to a 12.5-inch ‘laptop’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Zenbook 17 Fold OLED will also come with Windows 11 Home out of the box
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another thing worth noting is that, because there’s no actual physical keyboard on the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED, the device comes with the Asus ErgoSense Bluetooth keyboard and touchpad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Zenbook 17 Fold OLED weighs just 1.5kg without the keyboard, while with the keyboard it weighs 1.8kg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED will be available in Malaysia by the end of the year, and will be priced at an eye-watering RM14,999
            </p>
            
            <p>

                As highlighted by our reader recently, Maxis postpaid customers are charged RM15 for making or answering a single voice call while travelling overseas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This exorbitant charge is due to Maxis’ 1 Day Calls and SMS Unlimited Pass, which is activated automatically when you make or receive a call, or after sending more than 3 SMS in a day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This mandatory auto-activation of RM15 per day is only applicable to customers of the current Maxis Postpaid plans while customers on older postpaid as well as Hotlink prepaid and postpaid, are still charged based on pay-per-use, which is more appropriate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our intention for the unlimited Call & SMS daily pass was for everyone to enjoy worry free unlimited calls and SMS capped at RM15, not just incoming calls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ideally, Maxis should charge users based on their current pay-per-use rate until the total usage reaches a specific threshold
            </p>

                Since postpaid customers are already paying a premium, it would be nice if all telcos provide a decent amount of roaming data and voice minutes for a hassle-free and bill-shock-free experience.

            <p>
                As highlighted by our reader recently, Maxis postpaid customers are charged RM15 for making or answering a single voice call while travelling overseas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This exorbitant charge is due to Maxis’ 1 Day Calls and SMS Unlimited Pass, which is activated automatically when you make or receive a call, or after sending more than 3 SMS in a day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This mandatory auto-activation of RM15 per day is only applicable to customers of the current Maxis Postpaid plans while customers on older postpaid as well as Hotlink prepaid and postpaid, are still charged based on pay-per-use, which is more appropriate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our intention for the unlimited Call & SMS daily pass was for everyone to enjoy worry free unlimited calls and SMS capped at RM15, not just incoming calls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ideally, Maxis should charge users based on their current pay-per-use rate until the total usage reaches a specific threshold
            </p>

                VIVE is holding a UK sales event until September 11 where you can save £100 on the Cosmos Elite VR headset, and save more on other models too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Readers in the UK can save £100 on the VIVE Cosmos Elite VR headset when you grab it from VIVE's website until September 11.  Right now, you can get the HTC VIVE Cosmos Elite VR headset for just £349 (opens in new tab), down from the usual price of £449
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As VR headset deals go, this one is pretty solid.  While this deal is for the headset only, the VIVE Cosmos Elite is hailed as one of the most customizable and compatible models on the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There's also a host of other great deals (opens in new tab) on VIVE's website which will be highlighted below.  VIVE Cosmos Elite VR Headset Was £449 now £349 on VIVE (opens in new tab).  Save £100 on a VR headset that features in our best VR headset guide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If that wasn't enough for you, you also get two months of Viveport Infinity membership included with the headset.  But, this is a sales event that VIVE are offering so to have just one headset discounted wouldn't be enough
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can also enjoy £100 off the VIVE Cosmos (opens in new tab), the VIVE Pro headset (opens in new tab) and the VIVE Pro Full Kit (opens in new tab)

                The national 5G company, Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) has confirmed that there were indeed some last-minute changes to its shareholder agreement that was supposed to involve six local telcos
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report further added that Maxis and U Mobile did not see any benefits in having stakes in the national 5G company although both telcos apparently still want to obtain 5G access from DNB

            <p>
                DNB generally confirmed this through its media statement [pdf] which said that one of the six telcos decided not to proceed with the shareholder agreement while another choose not to respond even though they have earlier confirmed their participation in the agreement

            </p>

                Initially, Sony hoped to begin shipping the HT-A5000 in Europe from January 2022

            <p>
                According to Sony, the HT-A5000 supports the PlayStation 5-specific Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture Mode too, which arrived via a firmware update that Sony released this spring

                The feature is far from perfect and won’t replace the quality of a physical green screen, but we can attest that it does a decent job
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, it was possible to use a virtual green screen in OBS via plugins, but Nvidia Broadcast will make the feature much more accessible

            <p>
                Those who use an Nvidia RTX graphics card could probably already have the software installed, and Nvidia Broadcast also integrates with lots of popular streaming hardware and applications
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, Corsair integrated Nvidia Broadcast tools into its iCue and Elgato software back in July 2022, allowing those who rely on Corsair or Elgato hardware to utilize certain features such as its impressive background noise suppression
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Elgato Camera Hub also got access to Virtual Backgrounds at this time, allowing streamers to access Nvidia Broadcast tools without going to the app directly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Virtual Backgrounds is the only Nvidia -specific feature added to the latest version of OBS (version 28.0) but there are other non-Nvidia Broadcast features coming to the service, such as support for high-efficiency video coding (HEVC or H.265) and high-dynamic range (HDR)

                Following on from 2021’s tile-puzzler Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, Shovel Knight is set to make his return in roguelike platformer Dig
            </p>

                Shovel Knight Dig is due for release on September 23 via Nintendo Switch, Steam and Apple Arcade

                A co-development between Yacht Club and UK-based Nitrome, Shovel Knight Dig sees the plucky hero going up against a team of thieves led by Drill Knight, in a race through an “ever-changing chasm of mystery” made up of thousands of level chunks

            <p>
                “Jump, slash, and dig your way down an ever-changing chasm of mystery in Shovel Knight Dig, an all-new adventure.” Earlier this year, Yacht Club launched a kickstarter for its latest project Mina The Hollower, which smashed its target in less than 24 hours.  Shovel Knight Dig is one of four new titles coming to Apple Arcade in September

                The government had wanted six of the country's mobile operators to agree on taking a combined 70% stake in the agency, Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB)

                Maxis and U Mobile could not see benefits in being a minority shareholder in DNB, said two of the sources, but added that the firms have told the government they want to remain in talks for access to DNB's 5G network

                In an announcement this morning, FromSoft parent company Kadokawa Corporation - which remains the majority owner of the developer - confirmed that Sony now owns 14.09% of FromSoftware

            <p>
                Beyond that, attention is likely to turn to Elden Ring - as well as hopes for upcoming Elden Ring DLC, FromSoftware and publisher Bando Namcai have discussed their desire for the title to act as the start of a new franchise

            <p>
                While the future of Elden Ring seems in a better space than its more gothic older brother, it's far from clear at this point what we can expect from the deal, and Kadokawa Corporation suggests that the deal's impact on its 2023 financial results is likely to be "minor."

                There is no denying that looking at the durability tests of a device can be a painful endeavor, especially when the device does not survive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, at the same time, we have to admit the fact that a durability test does not always represent the real-life usage of that device in question because, more often than not, you are looking at the tester taking the device to an extreme measure that we certainly will not take
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can look at the test below and see how the Galaxy Z Fold 4 handles it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For a device this expensive, you would expect the durability to be good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it is worth noting that a foldable device is generally way more fragile than a standard phone, but seeing the Galaxy Z Fold 4 survive the test and pass with flying colors inspires a lot of confidence in the foldable device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, why would you put your device through sand and debris, right? With that said, if you are planning on getting your hands on the Galaxy Z Fold 4 but are afraid that the device itself is not durable enough, this should be more than enough for you to know that getting this phone is not going to be a problem

            <p>
                There is no denying that looking at the durability tests of a device can be a painful endeavor, especially when the device does not survive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, at the same time, we have to admit the fact that a durability test does not always represent the real-life usage of that device in question because, more often than not, you are looking at the tester taking the device to an extreme measure that we certainly will not take
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can look at the test below and see how the Galaxy Z Fold 4 handles it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For a device this expensive, you would expect the durability to be good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it is worth noting that a foldable device is generally way more fragile than a standard phone, but seeing the Galaxy Z Fold 4 survive the test and pass with flying colors inspires a lot of confidence in the foldable device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, why would you put your device through sand and debris, right? With that said, if you are planning on getting your hands on the Galaxy Z Fold 4 but are afraid that the device itself is not durable enough, this should be more than enough for you to know that getting this phone is not going to be a problem
            </p>

                From lossless audio support to fitness tracking, these are the big upgrades we hope to see on the AirPods Pro 2 Apple's AirPods Pro 2 could well be one of the stars of the Apple September Event that's now confirmed for September 7

            <p>
                While some people will be most excited about possible changes to the AirPods Pro 2's design, that's not how I roll.  As I'm a quality-audio enthusiast, the most exciting feature I'd like to see on the AirPods Pro 2's spec sheet is support for Apple's own ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) format
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, a patent, spotted by Patently Apple (opens in new tab), could enable the AirPods to overcome that problem by instead using optical audio transmission tech.  Regardless of what happens there, the AirPods Pro 2 have been tipped to come with Bluetooth LE Audio support

                This was first hinted at in a 2020 Apple patent, and the AirPods Pro 2 could potentially be the first to harness a new chip with more sophisticated smart processing to enable this functionality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current AirPods Pro manage around 4.5 hours of playback time, but the AirPods 3 can get to 6 hours playback from a single charge — albeit without ANC

                AMD is rumored to launch three new Zen 4 V-Cache CPUs, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, Ryzen 9 7900X3D & Ryzen 7 7800X3D at CES 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latest rumor regarding the Zen 4 V-Cache parts comes from Greymon55 who has put forward a cryptic tweet referring to the Ryzen 7000 3D V-Cache CPUs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the tweet, three Ryzen 3D V-Cache CPUs have been rumored, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, Ryzen 9 7900X3D & the Ryzen 7 7800X3D
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We can't say for sure yet if AMD will have a single CCD stacked with a 3D cache stack or if both Zen 4 CCDs will be stacked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In any case, if AMD goes with the existing 64 MB SRAM (3D V-Cache) stack, we will get up to 104 MB cache on the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, up to 140 MB cache on the Ryzen 9 7900X3D, and a whopping 144 MB of cache on the Ryzen 9 7950X3D
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's a 2.6x increase over Ryzen 7 7700X, an 85% increase over the 7900X, and an 80% increase over the Ryzen 9 7950X

                In March 2020, Dr Mahathir came into close contact with Bandar Kuching MP Dr Kelvin Yii who tested positive for Covid-19

                In March 2020, Dr Mahathir came into close contact with Bandar Kuching MP Dr Kelvin Yii who tested positive for Covid-19

            <p>
                In late July 2021, one of Dr Mahathir's officers was asymptomatic and had tested positive for Covid-19 in a screening at Parliament

                Dr Mahathir tested negative again after the second scare, even though he said he did not have contact with the officer in Parliament

                The last time the Langkawi MP was admitted to the National Heart Institute (IJN) was in late January this year

                As for other Android devices, they will only receive the update “later this year”, though many companies have already started rolling out Android 13 beta versions for their smartphones to customers, including Samsung with its popular Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S21 Series.  In fact, the Galaxy S22 Series had actually received Android 13 via One UI 5.0 beta even before Google officially released the final version of Android 13

                Well, it does make sense given how Android 13 beta has been around for ages and the One UI 5.0 is not utilising the final version of the latest Android OS.   Now, Samsung is rolling out the One UI 5.0 beta to the Galaxy S22 Series’ predecessor, the Galaxy S21 Series

            <p>
                Available for download for Galaxy S21 Series users in South Korea and the United Kingdom, the update carries the firmware version G99xBxxU5ZVHE according to SamMobile.  Moreover, the 1957.47MB update is available for all unlocked models of the Galaxy S21 Series which include the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+ and Galaxy S21 Ultra

                Here are 3 simple reasons to pick the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G as your next flagship device

            <p>
                The recently launched Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra not only packed in a built-in S Pen, it also comes with the highest-end camera specs of the entire Samsung Galaxy S22 series so it’s safe to assume that the S22 Ultra is every bit a super cameraphone as it’s S21 Ultra predecessor

                Well, if you’re a Samsung Galaxy S22 or Galaxy S21 user and are interested to test the Android 13 beta when it’s available in Malaysia, make sure to install the Samsung Members app on your device and log in to the app using your Samsung account

                Here are 3 simple reasons to pick the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G as your next flagship device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The recently launched Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra not only packed in a built-in S Pen, it also comes with the highest-end camera specs of the entire Samsung Galaxy S22 series so it’s safe to assume that the S22 Ultra is every bit a super cameraphone as it’s S21 Ultra predecessor

            <p>
                The LC3 audio codec will be able to compress audio more efficiently and it can be configured to use more or less bandwidth such as when there’s suddenly a longer distance between the host device and connected audio

            <p>
                Of course, for any regular consumer to be able to take advantage of this new codec, both the Android smartphone and audio device must support the same codec

            </p>

                So what are we going to do?” Hisyam replied that he would leave it to the court to decide
            </p>

                In essence, even though Hisyam will not argue the case, in the eyes of the court, he remains Najib’s lead counsel, and therefore, as Najib has representation in the eyes of the court, the appeal can proceed

                It is a foregone conclusion that Umno will not change for the better and will never be able to provide a clean, fair and honest government
            </p>

                Umno's stand after former prime minister Najib Abdul Razak has been imprisoned for his crime reveals a most disturbing and frightening prospect if it is allowed to rule again

            <p>
                When a powerful party like Umno exerts control, as in this case, the political outcomes have to be what that party wants

                The possibility of a hung Parliament after the upcoming election, the possible party horse-trading and the possible ensuing instability will weaken the country

                After all, who are the grassroots of Umno? But I fear the worst

                If Umno forms the government after the 15th general election, I can say “game over” for Malaysia

                It is a foregone conclusion that Umno will not change for the better and will never be able to provide a clean, fair and honest government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno's stand after former prime minister Najib Abdul Razak has been imprisoned for his crime reveals a most disturbing and frightening prospect if it is allowed to rule again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When a powerful party like Umno exerts control, as in this case, the political outcomes have to be what that party wants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The possibility of a hung Parliament after the upcoming election, the possible party horse-trading and the possible ensuing instability will weaken the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, who are the grassroots of Umno? But I fear the worst
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Umno forms the government after the 15th general election, I can say “game over” for Malaysia

                Samsung Android Firmware Updates Beta
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this month, Samsung opened up the public beta for One UI 5 based on Android 13 for the Galaxy S22 series, and today this is now also jumping to the Galaxy S21 devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So far, the beta program seems to have been started for these in Korea and the UK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you're in the UK and want to try your hand at this, note that the beta is currently only available for SIM-free, unlocked units
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will definitely be a bunch of further beta builds for One UI 5.0, and if you're registered into the testing program you'll receive each of those as it's released, as an over-the-air update

                Samsung Android Firmware Updates Beta
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this month, Samsung opened up the public beta for One UI 5 based on Android 13 for the Galaxy S22 series, and today this is now also jumping to the Galaxy S21 devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So far, the beta program seems to have been started for these in Korea and the UK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you're in the UK and want to try your hand at this, note that the beta is currently only available for SIM-free, unlocked units
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will definitely be a bunch of further beta builds for One UI 5.0, and if you're registered into the testing program you'll receive each of those as it's released, as an over-the-air update

                Samsung is on a roll with the One UI 5 (Android 13) beta program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's only been a few weeks since Samsung launched the One UI 5 (Android 13) beta for its flagship Galaxy S22 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's expected that there shouldn't be much difference in software between the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S22, so users can likely expect a similar experience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Keep in mind that this is beta software, so there are likely to be bugs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stable Android 13 is expected to start arriving on Galaxy smartphones later this year, but until then, we expect Samsung will expand its beta program to more of its best Android phones in the coming weeks

                Samsung is on a roll with the One UI 5 (Android 13) beta program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's only been a few weeks since Samsung launched the One UI 5 (Android 13) beta for its flagship Galaxy S22 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's expected that there shouldn't be much difference in software between the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S22, so users can likely expect a similar experience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Keep in mind that this is beta software, so there are likely to be bugs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stable Android 13 is expected to start arriving on Galaxy smartphones later this year, but until then, we expect Samsung will expand its beta program to more of its best Android phones in the coming weeks
            </p>

                Barcelona striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang suffered a broken jaw during a robbery at his house earlier in the week, sources confirmed to ESPN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aubameyang was assaulted in the early hours of Monday morning when a gang broke into his home equipped with firearms and iron bars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But sources have now confirmed to ESPN that the former Arsenal striker did break his jaw during the break-in and will be out for around three weeks, which could have implications on a proposed move to Chelsea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The injury to Aubameyang's jaw has slightly changed the negotiations, however, with a loan to the west London club emerging as a possible solution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barca coach Xavi Hernandez is happy to keep Aubameyang, but the club's need to reduce their wage bill to fund other business before the transfer window closes this week has forced them to listen to offers

                The cameras will rely on Huawei’s in-house XMAGE technology for the image processing, which will include a HiSilicon NPU (the phones are expected to use 4G versions of Qualcomm’s latest flagship chipsets)

            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will also apply for the iPhone boxes Apple leaker also says stocks “…are going well, so I’m assuming there will be little to no shipping delay when ordering it [the Apple Watch Series 8].” For those expecting changes on the box, it will be the same as the Apple Watch Series 7, meaning it will feature a band and a USB-C to MagSafe cable to charge the Apple Watch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Shrimp doesn’t talk about that, one of the main features of this upcoming Watch is a new body-temperature sensor, which will also be available with the rumored Apple Watch Pro

            <p>
                As outlined in a new blog post, one of those events, the Mists of Cyrangar, will see players taking on "unspeakable horrors" that "lie shrouded in the mist."

            <p>
                Dell is proactively reaching out to customers who may be impacted to replace the screen, ideally before it becomes loose

                Dell also noted that the problem is specific to OLED XPS 13 Plus models — non-OLED models, it seems, are not impacted

                It has been almost a full year since the GoPro Hero10 Black was unveiled, so it’s time for a new one
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This design dates back to the Hero9 generation, although last year’s model brought a larger sensor and a brand new GP2 chip, which enabled video capture at double the frame rate.

            <p>

                This design dates back to the Hero9 generation, although last year’s model brought a larger sensor and a brand new GP2 chip, which enabled video capture at double the frame rate.

                8BitDo’s older controllers like the SN30 Pro and Pro 2 have boasted a broad array of compatibility options thanks to their Bluetooth connectivity, but the Ultimate Controller will be available in three different configurations — Bluetooth ($69.99), 2.4Ghz ($49.99), or wired ($34.99) — based on your preferred console and connectivity method.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Ultimate Controller will offer a suite of premium features you’d typically find on a controller that costs twice as much
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides being offered in black, white, and pink colorways, the wireless models of the Ultimate Controller come packaged with their own charging dock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps the coolest new feature coming with the new Ultimate controller, however, is 8BitDo’s new controller software suite, which will allow you to remap and tune your controls on PC, Android, and iOS devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You’ll be able to save your preferences to up to three separate profiles, stored independently on the controller's hardware

                8BitDo’s older controllers like the SN30 Pro and Pro 2 have boasted a broad array of compatibility options thanks to their Bluetooth connectivity, but the Ultimate Controller will be available in three different configurations — Bluetooth ($69.99), 2.4Ghz ($49.99), or wired ($34.99) — based on your preferred console and connectivity method.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Ultimate Controller will offer a suite of premium features you’d typically find on a controller that costs twice as much
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides being offered in black, white, and pink colorways, the wireless models of the Ultimate Controller come packaged with their own charging dock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps the coolest new feature coming with the new Ultimate controller, however, is 8BitDo’s new controller software suite, which will allow you to remap and tune your controls on PC, Android, and iOS devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You’ll be able to save your preferences to up to three separate profiles, stored independently on the controller's hardware

                One of our few complaints is the controller’s symmetrical side-by-side joystick layout, which 8BitDo is finally addressing with a new version of its Xbox Ultimate wired controller that also finally goes wireless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That makes its use of side-by-side analog joysticks a bit confusing, because Nintendo has been using an asymmetrical joystick layout since the GameCube WaveBird, and continues to use it on its Joy-Cons and Pro Controller
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sure, the Wii U Pro Controller uses a symmetrical layout, but the stick placement on the 8BitDo Pro 2 is more like a Dualshock’s than that controller’s
            </p>

                It’s now simply called the 8BitDo Ultimate Controller, and will be available in three versions that cater to pretty much everything except, ironically, the Xbox (and Playstation)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It offers all the same features and functionality of 8BitDo’s wired Xbox controller and the wireless Pro 2, including compatibility with special software and apps for configuring the controller, the ability to store and easily switch between three different configuration profiles, and an extra pair of re-mappable paddle buttons on the back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They won’t replace the wireless 8BitDo Pro 2 controller, however, as that controller’s side-by-side joystick layout will still appeal to some gamers.

                JBL built a very similar version of the soundbar called the Bar 9.1 in 2020 that also had the cool removable rear speaker hat trick

                But the new JBL Bar 1000 adds two more drivers for a 7.1.4 arrangement and bumps the power output to 880W compared to 820W in the Bar 9.1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The JBL Bar 1000 will retail for $1,149, and the company is also releasing a cheaper $899 version called the Bar 800
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For those that just want something that’s better than the TV’s built-in speakers, JBL is also releasing the Bar 500 and Bar 300
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bar 500 includes a wireless subwoofer and will cost $649

                JBL built a very similar version of the soundbar called the Bar 9.1 in 2020 that also had the cool removable rear speaker hat trick
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the new JBL Bar 1000 adds two more drivers for a 7.1.4 arrangement and bumps the power output to 880W compared to 820W in the Bar 9.1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The JBL Bar 1000 will retail for $1,149, and the company is also releasing a cheaper $899 version called the Bar 800
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For those that just want something that’s better than the TV’s built-in speakers, JBL is also releasing the Bar 500 and Bar 300
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bar 500 includes a wireless subwoofer and will cost $649

                You can add up to eight apps to the bottom row.  If you don't want to have your most recent apps cycling through on the right side of the taskbar, you can get rid of it by opening the Settings app on your Z Fold 4 and going to Display > Taskbar and and sliding the switch next to Show recent apps to the Off position

                The 20-year-old, who was a £4.5m signing from Independiente in February 2021, has caught plenty of attention after impressing under Graham Potter this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Caicedo has been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, but Potter is confident he will remain on the south coast beyond Thursday's transfer deadline and insisted any potential suitors will need to break the bank to sign the midfielder.  Brighton boss Graham Potter (right) insists any potential suitors for Moises Caicedo (left) will need to break the bank to sign him this window Reports of a £42m bid for Caicedo was relayed back to Potter in his Monday press conference and was asked if it would be enough to part ways with the midfielder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'As soon as you do research on him you realise he is a top kid, great person, young, playing in the Premier League, has all the attributes to play at the very, very highest level.' Caicedo's value has soared since joining the Seagulls for £4.5m from Ecuadorian side Independiente del Valle in February 2021

            <p>
                That is how it is, but we are quite calm and confident.'   Saturday's 1-0 win against Leeds at the Amex Stadium lifted them level to 10 points with second-placed Manchester City and Tottenham, but Potter is paying little attention to their lofty position
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool were said to be one of the club's interested in Caicedo, given their growing injury list 'Ten points from four games is a great return and we're happy with that, but we need to stay calm and keep doing our best.' Potter will hand a late fitness test to Joel Veltman before the game at Craven Cottage

                Spray cans at the ready The Pokemon Company is teasing something new for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and fans think they've already figured out what is might be.  Yesterday on August 29, the official Pokemon Twitter account tweeted out the strange set of images just below

            <p>
                As you can see below, one eagle-eyed Twitter user, thinks that a trainer who appeared in a previous trailer for Scarlet and Violet will use this new Pokemon - whatever it ends up being - due to the person holding a spray can
            </p>
            
            <p>
                it seems likely that this trainer used the aiai pokemon as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That typing doesn't currently exist in Pokemon, which would make the new arrival an interesting specimen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Again, it's worth remembering Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are intentionally based in a region styled off Spain, so this theory that the new artwork represents Ibarrola's Oma Forest exhibition is very likely
            </p>

                The foldable from Google has been named the Pixel Notepad although, leaks and rumours have referred to it as the Pixel Fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the Google Pixel Notepad appears to have a bigger bezel in the patent illustration, the actual appearance ought to be better
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the patent, the flexible screen’s bezel will have a camera with a moving aperture, which, may be the first of its kind in a foldable device.  On August 5, a leak surfaced which disclosed that the Google Pixel folding screen projector will resemble the OPPO Find N from the front and the Google Pixel 7 from the rear.  The device will be relatively compact with a huge screen that folds inward horizontally and will have a complete screen without holes on the inner screen, along with a micro-perforated camera on the inner screen bezel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The outer screen will have a single hole in the middle.  As per previous leaks, the Google Pixel Notepad foldable is supposed to have a short and broad body and a 5.8-inch external screen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Pixel Notepad was reportedly going to have a 7.58-inch main display which would be manufactured by Samsung Display
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although this would make the Pixel Fold substantially more expensive than the cheapest Pixel 6, as well as Pixel 7, it would still be about $400 cheaper than the cheapest Galaxy Z Fold 3 & the Galaxy Z Flip 3

            <p>
                The teen girl told police during investigations that she had taken the baby girl because she liked her very much and wanted to care for the baby like her own child

                The pay per use rate is much more reasonable as users are charged exactly for how much they use by the minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If a traveller makes or receives a short voice call daily (less than 60 seconds) for ten days in Singapore, Maxis Postpaid users would have to pay RM150 (RM15 x 10 days) for the mandatory Call and SMS unlimited pass
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Maxis’ pay per use rate, the same user would only need to pay RM17.50 (RM1.75 x 10 days) for the exact same trip and usage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the daily pass was intended to prevent bill shock, Maxis could have stuck to charging pay per use rate until the usage reaches a certain daily threshold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if a user makes or receives less than 8 minutes of calls, they should be charged the normal rate per minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once it hits 8 minutes or more, the daily pass kicks in to cap the call roaming charges to RM15 per day

                If a traveller makes or receives a short voice call daily (less than 60 seconds) for ten days in Singapore, Maxis Postpaid users would have to pay RM150 (RM15 x 10 days) for the mandatory Call and SMS unlimited pass
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Maxis’ pay per use rate, the same user would only need to pay RM17.50 (RM1.75 x 10 days) for the exact same trip and usage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the daily pass was intended to prevent bill shock, Maxis could have stuck to charging pay per use rate until the usage reaches a certain daily threshold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, if a user makes or receives less than 8 minutes of calls, they should be charged the normal rate per minute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once it hits 8 minutes or more, the daily pass kicks in to cap the call roaming charges to RM15 per day

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 30 — DAP secretary-general Anthony Loke has called on Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to make decisions as Malaysia's number one leader, instead of his capacity as Umno's vice president
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Seremban MP said that Ismail Sabri should take advantage of the opportunities available to him from the unique political situation Malaysia has been in over the past year to implement more reforms to strengthen the country's democratic system in the remainder of his term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri dares to fight the tide and fend off all internal political pressures, he will be able to implement reforms that have long-term positive implications for our country and society," he said in a statement this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri has been under enormous pressure by his party, Umno — where he is a vice president — to call for an early general election (GE15)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno President Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid was seen riling up Umno delegates at the recent Umno Special General Assembly on August 27 to implore Ismail Sabri to give in to party whims, amid massive booing from the crowd when the former mentioned the latter's name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri recently conceded that he is in a dilemma over whether GE15 should be held this year or in 2023, in addition to ensuring a win for his party Umno and the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition

                This move will benefit some 1.2 million public officers under Grade 11 to Grade 56

            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Hence, the government agrees that a study on the civil service salary scale be expedited," he said

            <p>
                The Prime Minister also said that civil servants could look forward to a special financial aid of RM700, also to be paid in January 2023

                This move will benefit some 1.2 million public officers under Grade 11 to Grade 56
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was among a slew of announcements made by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob at the annual civil servants gathering on Tuesday (Aug 30)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Hence, the government agrees that a study on the civil service salary scale be expedited," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister also said that civil servants could look forward to a special financial aid of RM700, also to be paid in January 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The aid would be paid to those holding Grade 56 and below

                Ahmad Zahid today also explained that Exim Bank — which had provided a loan to Ri-Yaz — had later suggested that Yayasan Akalbudi withdraw its RM8.6 million investment in the company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When it was suggested that the Ri-Yaz share purchase was meant to be an investment by Yayasan Akalbudi and that Nurulhidayah was placed as a Ri-Yaz director to monitor Yayasan Akalbudi’s investment in the company, Shaheen told the court that he did not know about these
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the 12 criminal breach of trust charges involves Ahmad Zahid allegedly having transferred Yayasan Akalbudi’s RM17.9 million to Lewis & Co
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution had previously suggested that the actual purpose for the RM17.9 million transfer to Lewis & Co was to facilitate the share purchase deal, having highlighted that the RM17.9 million transfer was on June 28, 2016, while the law firm had issued the RM8.6 million cheque to the hotel company on June 30, 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution had also questioned how the RM8.6 million share purchase deal in the hotel firm would fit in with Yayasan Akalbudi’s stated aim of eradicating poverty and enhancing the welfare of the poor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid’s lead defence lawyer Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik had previously argued that the RM8.6 million hotel share purchase deal was not related to the criminal breach of trust charge involving the RM17.9 million sum, as the charge did not mention the deal

                Johor Baru North OCPD Asst Comm Rupiah Wahid said the scammer told the victim she was a doctor working in the United Kingdom

            <p>
                After about two weeks, the scammer told the victim that she wanted to send him a parcel containing US$2.8mil (RM12.54mil)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "On June 13, the victim received a call from another woman who claimed to be an agent from a courier company," ACP Rupiah said in a statement on Tuesday (Aug 30)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said the suspect told the victim that he had to pay a service charge to receive the parcel

                Johor Baru North OCPD Asst Comm Rupiah Wahid said the scammer told the victim she was a doctor working in the United Kingdom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After about two weeks, the scammer told the victim that she wanted to send him a parcel containing US$2.8mil (RM12.54mil)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "On June 13, the victim received a call from another woman who claimed to be an agent from a courier company," ACP Rupiah said in a statement on Tuesday (Aug 30)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said the suspect told the victim that he had to pay a service charge to receive the parcel

            <p>
                To find something specific like a smile, users simply type the "@" symbol on their laptop or computer, followed by the word "smile." Thus, typing "@smile" will pull up the smile emoji and other related emoji that you can select from

            <p>
                However, sometimes, you're not exactly sure what emoji you want to use; you just know you want to insert an emoji
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google says the new feature is an extension of the emoji reactions introduced in April

                To find something specific like a smile, users simply type the "@" symbol on their laptop or computer, followed by the word "smile." Thus, typing "@smile" will pull up the smile emoji and other related emoji that you can select from

                AMD announced its X670E, X670, and B650 chipsets during the AMD Keynote at Computex 2022, and this evening, AMD has announced a fourth chipset for Ryzen 7000, the B650E chipset
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The B650E chipset will run alongside the already announced B650 chipset, but as it's part of AMD's 'Extreme' series of chipsets, it will benefit from PCIe 5.0 lanes to at least one M.2 slot, as well as optional support for PCIe 5.0 to a PCIe graphics slot, features not available with standard B650 boards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During AMD's Keynote at Computex 2022, AMD's CEO Lisa Su unveiled three AM5 chipsets designed to harness the power of its 5 nm Zen 4 cores within the Ryzen 7000 processors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD's latest announcement of the B650E (Extreme) chipset gives motherboard vendors and users the option of a lower-cost platform but without sacrificing the longevity and expansion support of PCIe 5.0

                AMD announced its X670E, X670, and B650 chipsets during the AMD Keynote at Computex 2022, and this evening, AMD has announced a fourth chipset for Ryzen 7000, the B650E chipset
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The B650E chipset will run alongside the already announced B650 chipset, but as it's part of AMD's 'Extreme' series of chipsets, it will benefit from PCIe 5.0 lanes to at least one M.2 slot, as well as optional support for PCIe 5.0 to a PCIe graphics slot, features not available with standard B650 boards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During AMD's Keynote at Computex 2022, AMD's CEO Lisa Su unveiled three AM5 chipsets designed to harness the power of its 5 nm Zen 4 cores within the Ryzen 7000 processors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD's latest announcement of the B650E (Extreme) chipset gives motherboard vendors and users the option of a lower-cost platform but without sacrificing the longevity and expansion support of PCIe 5.0
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This ultimately means that AMD will have a mainstream platform that has PCIe 5.0 by default (B650E) and a lower-cost alternative with just PCIe 4.0 lanes to the PEG and M.2 slots

                Microsoft is planning to merge its Surface Pro X and Surface Pro "9" under the same product line later this year in the fall in an effort to help normalize its Windows on ARM offerings

            <p>
                I’m told there are no plans to offer the Surface Pro 9 with AMD chips, though AMD options will still be available on the upcoming Surface Laptop 5

                Dr Noor Hisham’s role in the fight against the pandemic was acknowledged by the World Health Organisation in September 2020, and Malaysia was viewed as a country that had a strong healthcare system and solid foundations to fight the pandemic

                According to The Athletic, Pulisic will stay at Stamford Bridge this season despite interest from Manchester United and Newcastle United

            <p>
                Despite Chelsea's issues in attack, the young American has only played 76 minutes during the first four matches of the season and expressed interest to move somewhere where he could play consistently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has two years remaining on his Chelsea contract but after ending last season on a strong note with a goal and an assist in his last three Premier League matches, Pulisic has been left out in the cold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pulisic can flit in and out of games, but he is a player who can bring the spark that Chelsea need even if it's being a more consistent presence off the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Twelve minutes here and five minutes there isn't a way for a player to become familiar with a role.  With so many games, Chelsea will have to dip into their depth eventually and play Pulisic

                As per its presentation, AMD’s new Ryzen 7000 series will be shipping out globally, with the initial lineup comprising no less than four SKUs at launch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That list, which also serves of confirmation of their existence, includes the Ryzen 5 7600X, Ryzen 7 7700X, Ryzen 9 7900X, and Ryzen 9 7950X
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moving up the ladder, the Ryzen 7 7700X is the 8-cores, 16-threads CPU with a boost clock of 5.4GHz, while the Ryzen 9 7900X is the 12-cores, 24-threads model of the four and a 5.6GHz boost clock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One thing to note is that the core and thread counts for these Ryzen 7000 series SKUs are identical to the previous generation Ryzen 5000 series, denoting that AMD clearly isn’t straying far from its naming and modeling template and, to state the obvious, merely improved on its performance and delivery, and on per-watt basis overall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On that note, AMD says that its Ryzen 7000 Series boasts a 13% Core IPC uplift over the previous generation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For that matter, we’re also looking at new X-Series and B-Series motherboards, all of which support overclocking

            <p>
                That list, which also serves of confirmation of their existence, includes the Ryzen 5 7600X, Ryzen 7 7700X, Ryzen 9 7900X, and Ryzen 9 7950X
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moving up the ladder, the Ryzen 7 7700X is the 8-cores, 16-threads CPU with a boost clock of 5.4GHz, while the Ryzen 9 7900X is the 12-cores, 24-threads model of the four and a 5.6GHz boost clock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One thing to note is that the core and thread counts for these Ryzen 7000 series SKUs are identical to the previous generation Ryzen 5000 series, denoting that AMD clearly isn’t straying far from its naming and modeling template and, to state the obvious, merely improved on its performance and delivery, and on per-watt basis overall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On that note, AMD says that its Ryzen 7000 Series boasts a 13% Core IPC uplift over the previous generation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For that matter, we’re also looking at new X-Series and B-Series motherboards, all of which support overclocking
            </p>

                iPhone 14 Pro is tipped to get a price hike and major upgrades Apple is gearing up for its big launch event on September 7, where we expect to see the company reveal a slew of iPhone 14 models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple’s focus could be on its Pro models, Ives added, as “Apple is expecting another heavy iPhone Pro and Pro Max mix shift."   Others have predicted an iPhone 14 Pro price hike, including Ives previously

            <p>
                A $100 price hike over what Apple currently charges for its Pro phones could see the iPhone 14 Pro go up to $1,099 and the iPhone 14 Pro Max hit $1,199
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The iPhone 14 Pro is likely to get get the new A16 Bionic chip, while rumors indicate the base iPhone 14 model could stick with the A15 chip.  The tech giant could also be giving the cameras in its Pro models a big boost for the first time

            <p>
                The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max could get a 48MP camera with support for 8K video recording

            <p>
                The most notable rumored design change for the iPhone 14 Pro is the removal of the display notch

                Like the Fold 3 and Fold 2 before it, the Fold 4 managed to survive the test, albeit with quite a few scratches and some burnt-up pixels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the real question is whether the Fold 4 can pass the test of time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The release of the first Galaxy Z Fold in 2019 was notably delayed due to a faulty screen, and Samsung has obviously come a long way since then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Samsung advertises its Z Fold 4 as “unbelievable tech built to last,” it describes its Z Flip 4 as having “serious durability [that] lets you flex and flip to your heart’s content” and lasts you 200,000 folds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without the plan (and if you’re not covered under warranty), you could wind up paying $499 to replace the Z Fold 4’s inner screen or $357 to repair it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Z Flip 4 is slightly less expensive, costing $349 for an inner screen replacement and $219 for a repair
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First and second-gen Flip and Fold devices (assuming you still have one that hasn’t needed a replacement yet) are eligible for cheaper one-time screen replacements that start at $119, however.

                Yoodo has become the latest local telco company to offer Voice Over WiFi (VoWiFi) service in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Allowing for better calls over any WiFi network, regardless of mobile coverage, VoWiFi allows users to make calls indoors through WiFi connection, hence the quality would be much better, especially if your mobile coverage indoors is not up to par
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Yoodo’s official website, the service is available for devices that have VoWiFi or WiFi calling supported by the network
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, only a handful of devices support Yoodo’s VoWiFi service, all of them being Android smartphones, with iOS devices yet to be supported by the network.   Among the smartphones supported include those from Xiaomi, vivo, Samsung, Nokia, HUAWEI and HONOR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Digi, Maxis and Celcom have already enabled the service for their users.  In fact, Yoodo’s introduction of VoWiFi should come as no surprise given its relationship with Celcom, which recently introduced the service back in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In case you didn’t know, Yoodo is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that runs on the Celcom network, hence they both share almost the same features.  So, what do you guys think of the VoWiFi services in Malaysia currently?

                The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra was arguably superseded by Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra, and when the Galaxy S22 Ultra arrived earlier this year looking even more like a Galaxy Note, the message was clear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regardless of apparent similarities, the Galaxy S22 Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 4 fill two very different spots at the top-end of Samsung’s smartphone lineup, and while the design of the Galaxy S22 Ultra may seem rather pedestrian compared to the Z Fold 4, it still has a lot going for it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Samsung’s Galaxy S22 Ultra has a single 6.8-inch display
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This point probably speaks the most about the differences between the Galaxy S22 Ultra and the Galaxy Z Fold 4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By comparison, you can get your hands on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra for as little as $1,200
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Z Fold 4 continues to broaden Samsung’s smartphone lineup in some interesting new ways, but it doesn’t push the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra aside

                The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra was arguably superseded by Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra, and when the Galaxy S22 Ultra arrived earlier this year looking even more like a Galaxy Note, the message was clear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regardless of apparent similarities, the Galaxy S22 Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 4 fill two very different spots at the top-end of Samsung’s smartphone lineup, and while the design of the Galaxy S22 Ultra may seem rather pedestrian compared to the Z Fold 4, it still has a lot going for it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Samsung’s Galaxy S22 Ultra has a single 6.8-inch display
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This point probably speaks the most about the differences between the Galaxy S22 Ultra and the Galaxy Z Fold 4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By comparison, you can get your hands on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra for as little as $1,200
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Z Fold 4 continues to broaden Samsung’s smartphone lineup in some interesting new ways, but it doesn’t push the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra aside
            </p>

                In a strongly-worded statement to defend the judiciary which came under attack after Najib was found guilty in the SRC case, the eight former presidents of the Malaysian Bar criticised the potential criminal act by those who had made false allegations against the SRC trial judge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The eight former presidents said the false allegation of bribery against Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali — the judge who had heard and decided on Najib’s SRC case — was “outrageous and spurious”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They suggested the attack on the judge could be a crime, pointing out that the bribery claims were false and actually attacked the entire judiciary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only is this a baseless assault on the learned Judge, but it is an assault on the whole Judiciary,” they said in a seven-page statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noting that the current attorney general Idrus was himself a former Federal Court judge, they said he must especially appreciate the ramifications or the consequences of such assaults on the judiciary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The eight of them also expressed “full support” for current Malaysian Bar president Karen Cheah in her defence of the independence of the judiciary

                Liverpool have been advised to make a move for Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves by former Manchester United player Luke Chadwick

            <p>
                Before Liverpool’s clash with Bournemouth on Saturday, however, the German tactician admitted that he is now interested in signing a new midfielder before the closure of the transfer window on September 1

            <p>
                With Neves having age on his side but also being an experienced Premier League player, he does certainly fit Liverpool’s transfer criteria and it will be interesting to see if we confirm our interest in the former FC Porto star

            <p>
                With Jude Bellingham expected to make the switch to Merseyside next season, we’ll just have to wait and see how much money the club are willing to splash on a midfielder this summer

                Currently, the iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099.   That's backed up by Kuo, who recently said he expects the average selling price of the iPhone 14 lineup to increase

                Adding emojis to Google Docs is about to get easier thanks to a new feature that allows people to search and insert the popular pictograms directly when typing, Google said in a blog post Monday.  Inserting an emoji requires typing the "@" followed by relevant text, such as "smile" or "dog." A dropdown menu will appear, allowing for quick selection.  Here's how Google Docs' new emoji insertion feature works.  Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment

                Adding emojis to Google Docs is about to get easier thanks to a new feature that allows people to search and insert the popular pictograms directly when typing, Google said in a blog post Monday.  Inserting an emoji requires typing the "@" followed by relevant text, such as "smile" or "dog." A dropdown menu will appear, allowing for quick selection.  Here's how Google Docs' new emoji insertion feature works.  Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment

                The search giant introduced emojis in Google Docs earlier this year

                According to Kuo, “whether iPhone 14 will offer satellite communication service depends on whether Apple and operators can settle the business model.” Kuo says this hurdle may have already delayed the feature once — according to him, the hardware that would’ve let the iPhone 13 communicate with satellites was finished, but Apple couldn’t figure out the business end with carriers

                @NexusBen Google Search is testing out a new label for articles that take under five minutes to read, with “Quick Read.”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Google Search users are able to see a new label next to articles that appear in response to their keywords that simply says “Quick Read.” This isn’t a new reader mode or anything like that, but simply an indication that the article shown is relatively brief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both the mobile and desktop Google Search experiences are seeing this new label in one of several different variations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s unclear how Google decides what is considered a “Quick Read” at this point, but it seems possible it could be determined simply by a general word count

                @NexusBen Google Search is testing out a new label for articles that take under five minutes to read, with “Quick Read.”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Google Search users are able to see a new label next to articles that appear in response to their keywords that simply says “Quick Read.” This isn’t a new reader mode or anything like that, but simply an indication that the article shown is relatively brief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both the mobile and desktop Google Search experiences are seeing this new label in one of several different variations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s unclear how Google decides what is considered a “Quick Read” at this point, but it seems possible it could be determined simply by a general word count
