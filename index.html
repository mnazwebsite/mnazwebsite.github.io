            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Tuesday, a witness in Zahid’s trial testified that RM2.6 million in political donations was given to Bersatu, the party which was formerly chaired by Mahathir
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                David Tan, UKSB’s former administrative manager, said the sum was passed to Rahmat after Pakatan Harapan (PH) won the 2018 general election and Mahathir was appointed the prime minister for the second time
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rahmat said in a statement that the witness’ testimony was false and defamatory

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Larry Sng (PBM-Julau) said the proposed bill would put independent MPs at a disadvantage because they would have to vacate their seats should they join a party
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The minister (Wan Junaidi) must recognise political realities and consider all factors involving independent MPs,” he told the Dewan Rakyat when debating the anti-hopping bill
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sng questioned why an independent MP had to vacate his seat if he joined a party, yet an MP who was sacked by his party was not required to do so
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                RSN Rayer (PH-Jelutong) interjected, pointing out that Sng was an independent MP before joining PKR, only to leave the party to become independent again and later formed Parti Bangsa Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sng responded by saying the law should not be based on the actions of one or two individuals and called for a more comprehensive law to protect independent MPs

            <p> </p>

                "We have collectively agreed there is no need for a new MOU or agreement," he told reporters after launching PTPTN’s 25th Silver Jubilee Anniversary celebrations at Matrade Exhibition and Convention Centre Wednesday (July 27)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Instead, what matters more was that issues stated in the MOU were resolved, he said, adding that this includes the Anti-Party Hopping law and laws on political funding

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This comes after PKR chief whip Datuk Johari Abdul said he could not comment on the MOU deadline although he believes a consensus has been reached between the Prime Minister and Pakatan Harapan on the matter
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "With or without an agreement or MOU, we want the Act to be passed to prevent party hopping after the next elections," he added

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said the MOU did not explicitly state an end date but only that it would be in effect until Parliament was dissolved

                Malaysians have continued to air their frustration with the rising cost of living and the lack of action by the government to handle it, leading to calls for ministers to take a pay cut and channel the savings to the public

                In a parliamentary written reply, Rina said the statistics department reported 1,856 child marriages in 2018, which went down to 1,459 in 2019 and reduced further to 1,124 in 2020

                Responding to a question from Maria Chin Abdullah (PH-Petaling Jaya), Rina said her ministry was implementing its national strategic plan in handling the causes of child marriage, which involves the federal and state governments, NGOs and international organisations

                Nunukan Immigration officer Lukie Reza Kusumah said that their investigations have begun to see if the three foreigners had violated Indonesia's immigration law under Article 122 for abusing their visit pass to carry out business
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The three were arrested with three other Indonesians including one suspect who allegedly had both Indonesian and Malaysian identity documents

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Initial investigations showed that the three together with their Indonesian counterparts were apparently taking pictures around the naval installations on the Indonesian side of Sebatik for the closest location for building a bridge from Sebatik to mainland Tawau
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nunukan Immigration officials said that the trio should be using a business visa and not tourists or visit visas

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                No decision has yet been made on whether the three would be charged for the immigration offence as investigations were still in progress

                Khairy said that the disruption of supply was due to the total lockdown in China where most of the supply for active ingredients for pharmaceutical products are produced and the Russia-Ukraine war where an ingredient which is added to the active ingredient was produced

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairy (BN-Rembau) added that the ministry has also agreed to release its stockpile to the private sector

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To ensure the country's drug security and self-reliance in times of crisis, local pharmaceutical companies are encouraged to produce their own active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) through public-private partnerships

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In addition to that, Khairy added that the ministry would also advocate pharmaceutical product patency by strengthening its cooperation with the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia to prevent patent ever-greening

                In a related note, Khairy said the ministry was looking into the implementation of price control through the price transparency mechanism
