Baena, who has the credentials to play across the front line, hasn’t actually started a La Liga game for Unai Emery’s side so far this season, but he’s still made a big impression as a substitute, scoring three goals in six appearances off the bench

                Off the back of that impressive campaign, Núñez earned a £30.6m move to Benfica, and after two seasons with the Primeira Liga side, he would become Liverpool’s record signing

            <p>
                With just two hours of pelting rain from 7am yesterday morning, retiree Mohd Farid Mohd Zarus, 60, found his house in Kampung Lada, Bayan Lepas, waist-deep in water

                To make matters worse, it was low tide yesterday morning but the high volume of rain was still too high for the water to flow out to sea

                With just two hours of pelting rain from 7am yesterday morning, retiree Mohd Farid Mohd Zarus, 60, found his house in Kampung Lada, Bayan Lepas, waist-deep in water
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s my first time facing a flood at home,” he said, pointing out that he moved in just four years ago

            <p>
                The downpour struck the south-east of Penang island badly and Penang International Airport, which is located there, was not spared either

            <p>
                To make matters worse, it was low tide yesterday morning but the high volume of rain was still too high for the water to flow out to sea

            <p>
                “When the rain started, the tide was less than 1m in the morning

            <p>
                However, the Constitution also stipulates that if an application for a pardon was filed within 14 days of the date of conviction, then the disqualification will only come into effect as soon as the petition is disposed of

                The Umno president who was just acquitted of all 40 graft charges in the Foreign Visa System (VLN) case said for those who tried to belittle Umno and their leadership under Barisan Nasional, the coming general elections would prove the unity and mechanism that Umno has at the grassroots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid then claimed that he was subjected to ridicule and negative labels, including attempts to topple him from the Umno presidency, when he was undergoing the trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I am not afraid to defend the Umno despite various political threats," he said Ahmad Zahid then reiterated claims that his court case was politically motivated after he refused to heed calls by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to dissolve Umno when the latter was prime minister under Pakatan Harapan rule
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I did not waver and the fact is, I still fight to defend Umno after being trusted by our grassroots all over the country to carry out my duties as president," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Friday (Sept 23), Ahmad Zahid was freed of all 40 graft charges in the VLN case after the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case

            <p>
                The Umno president who was just acquitted of all 40 graft charges in the Foreign Visa System (VLN) case said for those who tried to belittle Umno and their leadership under Barisan Nasional, the coming general elections would prove the unity and mechanism that Umno has at the grassroots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid then claimed that he was subjected to ridicule and negative labels, including attempts to topple him from the Umno presidency, when he was undergoing the trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I am not afraid to defend the Umno despite various political threats," he said Ahmad Zahid then reiterated claims that his court case was politically motivated after he refused to heed calls by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to dissolve Umno when the latter was prime minister under Pakatan Harapan rule
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I did not waver and the fact is, I still fight to defend Umno after being trusted by our grassroots all over the country to carry out my duties as president," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Friday (Sept 23), Ahmad Zahid was freed of all 40 graft charges in the VLN case after the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case

            <p>
                The net, which had drifted away from a fishing boat, was caught on the famed Barracuda Point dive site and extended toward Hanging Gardens, with some 18 fishes caught in it, including two sharks

            <p>
                Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Jafry Arifin said that the net was sighted at about 6am yesterday by a Sabah Parks ranger and the dive marshal on duty when they saw the floating buoys of the net which had drifted

                A wooden fishing boat had also approached the marine park yesterday morning around 9.40am, without a permit to enter, and claimed responsibility for the net which had drifted with the currents into the park

                China claims to have developed the world’s most advanced system for evaluating an aircraft’s ability to deliver a weapon at hypersonic speed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chinese media reported that this technology apparently uses robotic arms to test an aircraft’s capacity to discharge payload in a strong wind tunnel, making it perfect for testing a prototype hypersonic bomber
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Researchers at the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Center in Sichuan province are said to have developed a new hypersonic captive trajectory system (CTS) that employs two robotic arms to hold and tilt a prototype aircraft and its cargo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also enables them to analyze how the aircraft and its delivered item perform at high speeds.  However, Lin cautions that separating the aircraft from its payload at such high speeds could be risky
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shock waves, vortexes, and other airflow patterns may form when a hypersonic aircraft separates from another object, thereby increasing the chance of a collision involving the aircraft and its payload.  “Whether the storage can be safely separated from the aircraft becomes a big problem,” she said.  The team observed shock waves between the hypersonic aircraft and separating cargo during the Mach 6 experiment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The construction of hypersonic aircraft needs extensive wind tunnel tests since test flights are expensive

                Given the effect of La Nina, climatologist Prof Dr Fredolin Tangang said the risk of widespread flooding, especially on the east coast of peninsula Malaysia, was very high

                “No doubt the weather and climate, especially the extremes, have become more variable in the last couple of decades.“Consistent with the global mean temperature, the temperature in Malaysia has also been rising steadily,” he said

                Climate expert Prof Datuk Dr Azizan Abu Samah from Universiti Malaya agreed, saying that La Nina, coupled with the Indian Ocean Dipole event that caused the weather to be ripe for rain, could bring higher than average rainfall to Malaysia during the north-east monsoon season, expected to begin in November and strengthen in December.“Certainly in November, especially in the east coast states of Kelantan and Terengganu, there will be more rain than usual, depending on how bad the weather is,” he said

                Fire and Rescue Services Department director-general Datuk Seri Mohammad Hamdan Wahid said some 14,800 personnel had been directed to be on high alert amid La Nina and the impending north-east monsoon season

            <p>
                On Sept 12, Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob instructed the disaster management committees at the district level to be immediately activated to face the north-east monsoon and floods

                On Wednesday, five individuals were remanded for three days until Friday (Sept 23), after they were believed to be involved in the submission of false claims for a training programme related to digital technology provided to a government agency although the training was not conducted

                About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, Sept 23 — A 67-year-old woman was trampled to death by an elephant in Dumpas, Tawau this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tawau district police chief assistant commissioner Jasmin Hussin confirmed the death of the woman, who had been riding pillion on a motorcycle with her husband on an estate road at about 7.30am when the elephant attacked them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The elephant came out of the palm oil plantation area and headed straight towards the couple and lashed out at them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sabah Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister Datuk Jafry Arifin said that a call was received by Tawau wildlife officer Primus Lambut at 8.20am, but by then the elephant had left the area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The elephant that attacked was from the herd previously observed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Sabah Softwoods plantation had set up a wildlife corridor for the elephants and they also cultivated napier grass for the elephants to feed on to reduce the risk of elephants intruding into their plantation and damaging crops,” he said

                About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, Sept 23 — A 67-year-old woman was trampled to death by an elephant in Dumpas, Tawau this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tawau district police chief assistant commissioner Jasmin Hussin confirmed the death of the woman, who had been riding pillion on a motorcycle with her husband on an estate road at about 7.30am when the elephant attacked them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The elephant came out of the palm oil plantation area and headed straight towards the couple and lashed out at them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sabah Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister Datuk Jafry Arifin said that a call was received by Tawau wildlife officer Primus Lambut at 8.20am, but by then the elephant had left the area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The elephant that attacked was from the herd previously observed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Sabah Softwoods plantation had set up a wildlife corridor for the elephants and they also cultivated napier grass for the elephants to feed on to reduce the risk of elephants intruding into their plantation and damaging crops,” he said

                France kept their hopes of staying in the top tier of the Nations League alive as goals by Kylian Mbappe and Olivier Giroud secured a 2-0 home victory over Austria on Thursday

                France kept their hopes of staying in the top tier of the Nations League alive as goals by Kylian Mbappe and Olivier Giroud secured a 2-0 home victory over Austria on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mbappe opened the scoring with another stunning goal before Giroud, who again showed coach Didier Deschamps he is more than a third-choice forward, sealed the world champions' win with a header
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We did what we had to do," the 1998 world champion said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mbappe fired a shot into the top corner in the second minute, but the effort was disallowed for offside
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If I call him, it's so he can score goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I did not say that he would be there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Five games without a goal from open play -- and the World Cup two months away -- will sting England more than being relegated in Nations League

            </p>
            
            <p>
                when this cars launch in indonesia first time my question is why hyundai not CKD the kona instead of this hyundai creta i mean the hyundai creta looks like for indian and chinese market models while the kona looks global design and also up to date looks China market is the world most competitive market with latest models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                your ‘china market’ is 1980 not 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why Creta? What does Creta mean? You place “Ex…..” and you get a bit too pleasant name
            </p>

                After hearing arguments from both the prosecution and Zahid’s lawyer, High Court judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah decided that the prosecution could start impeachment proceedings against Zahid’s third defence witness Jefri Jamil
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                The prosecution’s bid to impeach Jefri is based on contradictions between what he had told the MACC during investigations and what he had told the court today during Zahid’s trial

            <p>
                After taking time to compare Jefri's statement to the MACC and his testimony in court today, the judge decided there was material differences between both

                Manchester United are "ahead of schedule" with their recruitment plans under manager Erik ten Hag, club football director John Murtough said on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United spent more than £225 million on six new players during Ten Hag's first summer in charge, including Lisandro Martinez and Antony from former club Ajax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Overall, we are ahead of schedule in our recruitment plans as envisaged at the start of the summer, and we do not anticipate the same level of activity in future windows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As always, our planning focuses on the summer window." United signed Martinez, Anthony, Casemiro, Christian Eriksen, Tyrell Malacia and Martin Dubravka over the summer, but Murtough said the most significant arrival was Ten Hag himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The most important development during the 2021-22 season was the appointment of Erik ten Hag as manager," Murtough added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fourth quarter financial results also revealed the club's wage bill has increased by £61m to £384m after investment in the squad in both 2021 and 2022 while the cost of terminating contracts with former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and former interim manager Ralf Rangnick, plus associated staff, was £24.7m.

                Manchester United are "ahead of schedule" with their recruitment plans under manager Erik ten Hag, club football director John Murtough said on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United spent more than £225 million on six new players during Ten Hag's first summer in charge, including Lisandro Martinez and Antony from former club Ajax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Overall, we are ahead of schedule in our recruitment plans as envisaged at the start of the summer, and we do not anticipate the same level of activity in future windows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As always, our planning focuses on the summer window." United signed Martinez, Anthony, Casemiro, Christian Eriksen, Tyrell Malacia and Martin Dubravka over the summer, but Murtough said the most significant arrival was Ten Hag himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The most important development during the 2021-22 season was the appointment of Erik ten Hag as manager," Murtough added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fourth quarter financial results also revealed the club's wage bill has increased by £61m to £384m after investment in the squad in both 2021 and 2022 while the cost of terminating contracts with former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and former interim manager Ralf Rangnick, plus associated staff, was £24.7m.

                The decision, which was unanimous, takes the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate to 3% to 3.25% -- the highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis, and up from near zero at the start of this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The projections, which showed a steeper rate path than officials laid out in June, underscore the Fed’s resolve to cool inflation despite the risk that surging borrowing costs could tip the US into recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before the release, traders expected rates to reach 4.5% in early 2023 before falling about a half point by the end of the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The updated forecasts also showed unemployment rising to 4.4% by the end of next year and the same at the end of 2024 -- up from 3.9% and 4.1%, respectively, in the June projections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June, as measured by the 12-month change in the US consumer price index
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Job growth, meanwhile, has remained robust and the unemployment rate, at 3.7%, is still below levels most Fed officials consider to be sustainable in the longer run

                The decision, which was unanimous, takes the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate to 3% to 3.25% -- the highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis, and up from near zero at the start of this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The projections, which showed a steeper rate path than officials laid out in June, underscore the Fed’s resolve to cool inflation despite the risk that surging borrowing costs could tip the US into recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before the release, traders expected rates to reach 4.5% in early 2023 before falling about a half point by the end of the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The updated forecasts also showed unemployment rising to 4.4% by the end of next year and the same at the end of 2024 -- up from 3.9% and 4.1%, respectively, in the June projections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June, as measured by the 12-month change in the US consumer price index
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Job growth, meanwhile, has remained robust and the unemployment rate, at 3.7%, is still below levels most Fed officials consider to be sustainable in the longer run

                In addition, given that Malaysia has very high food imports, the food costs for many in Malaysia are expected to soar.   Malaysia’s unbridled politicking is not helping the ringgit situation either
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Research in economics and finance over the decades established that the strongest predictors of an imminent speculative attack on a currency are the behaviour of the home country’s international reserves, the real exchange rate, domestic credit, credit of the public sector, and domestic inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This strategy of currency defeat is also not an option in case of rising domestic inflation, as it will undoubtedly send domestic inflation to new highs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low foreign reserves (that are potentially sliding lower) is critical for a country that highly depends on food imports (RM63.3 billion in 2021)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, the interest rate hike is also believed to ward off currency depreciation

            <p>
                At the same time, the depreciating ringgit makes it unattractive for foreign investors to invest in local production as they take their profits in foreign currencies unless it is a foreign-denominated debt which exposes Malaysia to other risks of depreciating ringgit

                Earlier, Gunamalar told the court that Muhammad Nagahswaran, the respondent, violated a court order when he abducted their three children — a pair of 14-year-old twin girls and a 10-year-old boy

                Gunamalar said the application was only filed on July 4 because the child’s whereabouts were previously unknown

                On June 15, the High Court dismissed the Perlis Islamic Religious and Malay Customs Council’s (MAIPs) application to intervene in a divorce petition between Loh and Muhammad Nagahswaran so that it would have locus standi to apply for a variation on the terms of the sole custody order granted to Loh

            <p>
                On March 7, MAIPs filed the intervention application so that it would have locus standi to apply for a variation on the terms of the sole custody order

            <p>
                In the divorce petition, Loh, 34, was granted sole custody, care and control over the three children

            <p>
                Meanwhile, Gunamalar told reporters that MAIPs’ appeal of the court’s decision to intervene in the divorce petition will be heard in the Court of Appeal on February 7, 2023

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 21 — Eight Kuala Lumpur residents, led by former Malaysian Bar chairman Datuk Ambiga Sreenevasan, have demanded the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) provide information on flood mitigation plans for the upcoming monsoon season or face a lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Such transparency of information is crucial for public awareness and to enable public participation which, in turn, is a cornerstone of good public policy-making
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The residents pointed out that the A-G found that only eight out of 104 or 7.7 per cent of flood mitigation measures proposed in the 2017 master plan have been implemented or are in the process of implementation by DBKL
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “DBKL’s response to the A-G was that another 22 flood mitigation measures would be implemented in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They also said the AG had identified that five short-term mitigation measures proposed in the flood master plan had not been implemented in the highly flood-prone areas encompassing Jalan Tun Razak, Persiaran Ampang Hilir and Jalan U-Thant as of March this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last but not least, the residents also demanded information on “any other flood mitigation measures which DBKL has implemented or plans to implement in order to deal with the risk of flooding in Kuala Lumpur”.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 21 — Eight Kuala Lumpur residents, led by former Malaysian Bar chairman Datuk Ambiga Sreenevasan, have demanded the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) provide information on flood mitigation plans for the upcoming monsoon season or face a lawsuit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Such transparency of information is crucial for public awareness and to enable public participation which, in turn, is a cornerstone of good public policy-making
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The residents pointed out that the A-G found that only eight out of 104 or 7.7 per cent of flood mitigation measures proposed in the 2017 master plan have been implemented or are in the process of implementation by DBKL
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “DBKL’s response to the A-G was that another 22 flood mitigation measures would be implemented in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They also said the AG had identified that five short-term mitigation measures proposed in the flood master plan had not been implemented in the highly flood-prone areas encompassing Jalan Tun Razak, Persiaran Ampang Hilir and Jalan U-Thant as of March this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last but not least, the residents also demanded information on “any other flood mitigation measures which DBKL has implemented or plans to implement in order to deal with the risk of flooding in Kuala Lumpur”.
