                Here are five talking points from the first European night of Erik ten Hag's Old Trafford tenure..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United have shown commendable character to recover from a nightmare start to the season in recent weeks, but their recent revival was snuffed out by Real Sociedad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are likely to be plenty of ups and downs for Manchester United under Ten Hag this season, but the meek manner of this defeat will have disappointed their new boss in the wake of their recent improvement
            </p>

                It was not a night to remember for United's No.7 - who is now likely to revert back to the bench after failing to make the most of his chance to impress
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 30-year-old was at the heart of United's best moves on the night and looked streets ahead of his teammates at times

                Manchester United have shown commendable character to recover from a nightmare start to the season in recent weeks, but their recent revival was snuffed out by Real Sociedad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are likely to be plenty of ups and downs for Manchester United under Ten Hag this season, but the meek manner of this defeat will have disappointed their new boss in the wake of their recent improvement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was not a night to remember for United's No.7 - who is now likely to revert back to the bench after failing to make the most of his chance to impress
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 30-year-old was at the heart of United's best moves on the night and looked streets ahead of his teammates at times

                Justice Vazeer Alam, who chaired a three-member bench, said he decided to recuse himself from hearing the appeal as he had some connection with the parties involved when he was in practice

                The other two judges on the bench were Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail and Datuk Seri Mariana Yahya.court is scheduled to hear the Baling MP’s appeal against the Penang High Court’s decision, made on Nov 12, 2020, which dismissed his suit against the former Penang Chief Minister in connection with the construction of the Penang undersea tunnel project

            <p>
                Abdul Azeez filed the suit in March 2018, claiming that Lim, who was then the Finance Minister, had issued defamatory statements during a press conference at the Penang Chief Minister’s office on Feb 28, 2018, and during a Chinese New Year open house hosted by the Penang Development Corporation on the same day, connecting him ( Abdul Azeez) with a payment of RM3 million in consultation fee by the developer of the undersea tunnel project

            <p>
                Recently, the former Sabah State Railway Department employee broke a record he "accidentally" created in 2015, by once again becoming the nation’s oldest man to scale Mount Kinabalu when he was 83
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Back in 2015, I climbed Mount Kinabalu and after returning home, I found that news of me successfully completing the hike as the oldest Malaysian was in almost every local newspaper,” Buatin said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also did a body and health examination prior to that just to certify that he was fit enough to do the climb
            </p>

            <p>
                Recently, the former Sabah State Railway Department employee broke a record he "accidentally" created in 2015, by once again becoming the nation’s oldest man to scale Mount Kinabalu when he was 83
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Back in 2015, I climbed Mount Kinabalu and after returning home, I found that news of me successfully completing the hike as the oldest Malaysian was in almost every local newspaper,” Buatin said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also did a body and health examination prior to that just to certify that he was fit enough to do the climb

                James Milner was bad — more on that shortly — but he was not the only one
            </p>

                Milner was, in truth, fortunate to escape being sent off or substituted in the first half of the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unfortunately for Liverpool, though, it was not a performance to remember.

            <p>
                The Dutchman's side have now won four games on the trot and sit in fifth place after six games ‘Both of the finishes got a little clip off somebody, but he’s getting the luck now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With his pace, he is f****** dangerous.' Wright also felt as if the confidence was returning to Rashford and this was key for his improved performances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But what I’ve seen from him up until this point, especially with the last two goals he’s scored, is somebody that thinks “If I’m going through, I’m scoring”.' Ten Hag's side have now won four games on the trot and sit in fifth place after six games so far this season.  Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group

                The Dutchman's side have now won four games on the trot and sit in fifth place after six games ‘Both of the finishes got a little clip off somebody, but he’s getting the luck now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With his pace, he is f****** dangerous.' Wright also felt as if the confidence was returning to Rashford and this was key for his improved performances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But what I’ve seen from him up until this point, especially with the last two goals he’s scored, is somebody that thinks “If I’m going through, I’m scoring”.' Ten Hag's side have now won four games on the trot and sit in fifth place after six games so far this season.  Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group

                Khairy said the TWG also recommended giving the first vaccine booster to children aged five to under 12; COVID-19 vaccination for children aged between six months and five years and heterologous vaccination for the second booster dose, adding that a heterologous vaccine with mRNA vaccine or viral vector vaccine for the second booster dose can be administered to individuals who are at high risk of developing serious illnesses due to Covid-19

                Wednesday, 07 Sep 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the high court decision in Sep 2021, a few mothers were successful in getting citizenships for their children born abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision, says the UN in a press statement released on Sept 5, contravenes Malaysia’s obligations under international law and "the need to interpret all constitutional provisions concerning citizenship, and its transference, without discrimination based on sex"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In August 2022, the Court of Appeal overturned a landmark 2021 High Court ruling which would have allowed Malaysian mothers married to foreign spouses the right to pass down citizenship to children born abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When children of Malaysian descent are banned from being part of society based on a discriminatory interpretation of the law, it does not only negatively impact them, but the community and State lose the opportunity to thrive socially, politically and economically." On Sep 9, 2021, the High Court ruled that the word “father” in paragraphs 1(b) and 1(c) of Part II of Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution shall be interpreted harmoniously to include “mother” and that overseas-born children of Malaysian women are citizens by “operation of law." However, on 5 August 2022, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Government’s appeal, declaring that the relevant provisions of the Constitution specifically refer to the “biological father” and cannot be extended to mean the “mother." “We regret that the Malaysian Government is responsible for this setback instead of seizing an opportunity to make progress towards the realisation of gender equality

                Wednesday, 07 Sep 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the high court decision in Sep 2021, a few mothers were successful in getting citizenships for their children born abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision, says the UN in a press statement released on Sept 5, contravenes Malaysia’s obligations under international law and "the need to interpret all constitutional provisions concerning citizenship, and its transference, without discrimination based on sex"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In August 2022, the Court of Appeal overturned a landmark 2021 High Court ruling which would have allowed Malaysian mothers married to foreign spouses the right to pass down citizenship to children born abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When children of Malaysian descent are banned from being part of society based on a discriminatory interpretation of the law, it does not only negatively impact them, but the community and State lose the opportunity to thrive socially, politically and economically." On Sep 9, 2021, the High Court ruled that the word “father” in paragraphs 1(b) and 1(c) of Part II of Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution shall be interpreted harmoniously to include “mother” and that overseas-born children of Malaysian women are citizens by “operation of law." However, on 5 August 2022, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Government’s appeal, declaring that the relevant provisions of the Constitution specifically refer to the “biological father” and cannot be extended to mean the “mother." “We regret that the Malaysian Government is responsible for this setback instead of seizing an opportunity to make progress towards the realisation of gender equality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We call on the Government to fulfil its obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child by interpreting the law to ensure there is no contradiction between Article 14(1)b and Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution, as amended by Parliament to prohibit discrimination against citizens based on descent, place of birth or gender in any law,” the UN experts said.

            <p>
                Sources said the suspect, a woman in her 40s, was responsible for making the payment without complying with the company's financial and procurement procedures
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The second suspect is the head of the company's marketing division and is believed to have made payments to six "fake" individuals and entities," said a source
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The suspects were arrested when they turned up at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission headquarters at around 9.30pm on Tuesday (Sept 6) night

                It is learnt that the finance manager had paid RM10mil to facilitate the approval for the company where the suspect is employed, to take over the project from another company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources said the suspect, a woman in her 40s, was responsible for making the payment without complying with the company's financial and procurement procedures
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The second suspect is the head of the company's marketing division and is believed to have made payments to six "fake" individuals and entities," said a source
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The suspects were arrested when they turned up at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission headquarters at around 9.30pm on Tuesday (Sept 6) night

                People with more than US$1 million of investable funds are repositioning toward private markets to shield their assets from market volatility, Lombard Odier’s 2022 study about high net-worth individuals in Asia Pacific found
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The surge in inflation and its repercussions on the global economy are the biggest concern for 77% of the people polled, Lombard Odier said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Half of them are worried about market volatility, which has pushed as much as 56% of them to increase diversification
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The rich in Singapore and Australia are leading the trend, with about 60% of them planning to increase their allocations to private markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The concern of lack of visibility, volatility and the willingness to manage it are homogeneous across the markets and across age brackets,” said Jean-Francois Aboulker, the bank’s Asia head of ultra-high net-worth individuals.

                On Sunday (Sept 4), Bernama reported that a Malaysian couple who went to Bangkok to look for their missing son were heartbroken upon finding out that he had passed away on May 11 at Mae Sot Hospital near the Thailand-Myanmar border
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The couple travelled to Bangkok on Aug 30 and were scheduled to fly to Mae Sot the next day to meet their son, who was said to be sick and receiving treatment at the hospital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, they were told that Zhan Feng had actually passed away 2am on May 11 and doctors believed that the victim was abused before being left at the hospital on April 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 31, Zhan Feng called his parents and informed them that he was in Mae Sot in Tak Province and that he needed RM80,000 for medical treatment; that was the last time the parents heard from him

                So, when Sharjah FC approached him with a three-year contract offer, Pjanic took it under serious consideration and decided to join the club

                The 32-year-old will terminate his contract with Barcelona and join Sharjah FC on a free transfer

            <p>
                Pjanic joined Barcelona from Juventus in the summer of 2020, in an ill-advised move that saw Arthur Melo move the other way

                So, when Sharjah FC approached him with a three-year contract offer, Pjanic took it under serious consideration and decided to join the club
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bosnian international pretty much confirmed the transfer with a post on social media last night as he flew out to UAE to finalise the transfer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An agreement over a three-year deal has been in place since Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And now, Pjanic will complete his medical at his new club tpday before an official announcement of the transfer will be made
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 32-year-old will terminate his contract with Barcelona and join Sharjah FC on a free transfer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pjanic joined Barcelona from Juventus in the summer of 2020, in an ill-advised move that saw Arthur Melo move the other way

                It took time for Ten Hag to start working his magic with his new side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, one such player United were linked with earlier this summer was Ajax striker Brian Brobbey
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, Brobbey also admits Ten Hag tried to recruit him this summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I am very happy for [Erik ten Hag] and he really deserves it after everything he has done for Ajax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                joking joking!” Brobbey said when asked about Ten Hag’s move
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Initially, Ten Hag's focus will be on finishing as high up the Premier League table as possible, but he will know that the prize at the end of the Europa League -- a trophy and an automatic place in next season's Champions League group stage as a top seed -- is too good an opportunity to throw away
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jose Mourinho didn't want to play in the Europa League either when he took the United job in 2016 and for his first group game against Feyenoord he made eight changes to his team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United won just one of their last six league games and finished sixth, but crucially, they lifted the Europa League trophy after beating Ajax 2-0 in the final to ensure a return to the Champions League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Ten Hag, just as it was for Mourinho, the Europa League is a means to an end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But before all that, Ten Hag has to get United back into the Champions League as quickly as possible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If it's done by winning the Europa League, then his first season will be considered a success regardless of where they finish in the Premier League.

                Initially, Ten Hag's focus will be on finishing as high up the Premier League table as possible, but he will know that the prize at the end of the Europa League -- a trophy and an automatic place in next season's Champions League group stage as a top seed -- is too good an opportunity to throw away
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jose Mourinho didn't want to play in the Europa League either when he took the United job in 2016 and for his first group game against Feyenoord he made eight changes to his team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United won just one of their last six league games and finished sixth, but crucially, they lifted the Europa League trophy after beating Ajax 2-0 in the final to ensure a return to the Champions League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Ten Hag, just as it was for Mourinho, the Europa League is a means to an end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But before all that, Ten Hag has to get United back into the Champions League as quickly as possible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If it's done by winning the Europa League, then his first season will be considered a success regardless of where they finish in the Premier League.

            <p>
                Regionally, Malaysia was perceived as having the third strongest social cohesion in the region behind Singapore and Thailand, with just 40 per cent of respondents seeing Malaysian society as having a strong cohesion

            <p>
                Overall, 69 per cent of respondents felt that there is strong social cohesion in South-east Asia

                Former Finance Ministry deputy secretary-general Datuk Siti Zauyah Mohd Desa, 63, said various efforts were made by the ministry to get the latest information from 1MDB on how the US$3bil was used, but the company never responded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We also contacted the representative of 1MDB at the time, Zahid Taib to give feedback and submit a report to the Ministry of Finance, but there was no reply

            <p>
                "I also confirm that I have never seen the joint venture agreement document between 1MDB and Aabar Investment BVI Co, which is in their LOS application to the government to secure the US$3bil loan," she said when cross-examined by lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed who was representing former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak at the trial involving the misappropriation of RM2.3bil from 1MDB

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if she had seen any document showing that 1MDB failed to make repayments causing the government to bear the debt, Siti Zauyah replied "I don't remember..there must be some evidence, that's why I said that in my witness statement"

                With Oxlade-Chamberlain and Keita both potentially leaving Liverpool, the focus is on what the future of the Anfield midfield will look like

                On Sunday, Khairy confirmed that Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan, who is the Rembau Umno division chief, has asked him to make way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Political analysts said the move could be seen as Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi’s retaliation against Khairy and other party leaders who were not immediately obeying his wishes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Fauzi argued that Khairy represented the future of Umno and has even been touted as a possible candidate to be prime minister, indicating his appeal among sections of Malaysia that did not traditionally support Umno

            <p>
                Even before Khairy confirmed he was told to yield Rembau, there were already rumours that he could be moved to the Port Dickson federal seat where the incumbent is Opposition Leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Ahmad Fauzi and Azmi were pessimistic about Khairy’s chances of defeating Anwar in the seat he won by a landslide, even with the current approval the health minister’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in Malaysia

                On whipping, Wan Junaidi said the proposed amendments would not do away with the punishment, but again give judges the discretion on whether to impose it

                The abolition of the mandatory death sentence was first raised by the Pakatan Harapan administration in 2018 and a moratorium on execution was then implemented.

                The court was of the opinion that places where the four money laundering charges were allegedly committed were not properly specified by the prosecution

                The court then made the order for the appellant to be discharged and acquitted of the third, seventh, eighth and ninth charges of money laundering

                For the money laundering charges, Abdul Azeez allegedly committed the offences in the Klang Valley area between March 8, 2010, and Aug 30, 2018.

                That was in order to make room for Ten Hag’s summer additions

                And on Monday, Jones was completely omitted from the club’s Europa League squad

                Ferdinand, who actually played alongside Jones at United, admits he feels sorry for his old teammate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So I just hope he stays fit and at some point he’ll be able to go out and play somewhere.” Jones was not the only United first-teamer left out of Te Hag’s Europa League squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At least by doing that, Jones is then in control of his own future going forward

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, Sept 6 ― Liz Truss will replace Boris Johnson as Britain's prime minister today, travelling to see Queen Elizabeth in Scotland before appointing a new team of top cabinet ministers to tackle the economic crisis and draw her deeply divided party together
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Long the front-runner to replace him, Truss will become the Conservatives' fourth prime minister in seven years

                Although Britain is well-versed in choosing ― and replacing ― prime ministers, the choreography of the day will have an unfamiliar feel, with Queen Elizabeth meeting Johnson and Truss in Balmoral rather than Buckingham Palace
            </p>

                The palace announced last week that the queen would appoint the new prime minister in Balmoral, where she spends her summers, due to mobility issues

            <p>
                Truss therefore must travel to Balmoral to become prime minister, a round-trip of around a thousand miles, rather than the two-mile round-trip that prime ministers usually enjoy

                Liz Truss gestures outside the Conservative Party headquarters, after being announced as Britain's next Prime Minister, in London, Britain September 5, 2022

            <p>
                Long the front-runner to replace him, Truss will become the Conservatives' fourth prime minister in seven years

                Although Britain is well-versed in choosing - and replacing - prime ministers, the choreography of the day will have an unfamiliar feel, with Queen Elizabeth meeting Johnson and Truss in Balmoral rather than Buckingham Palace

            <p>
                The palace announced last week that the queen would appoint the new prime minister in Balmoral, where she spends her summers, due to mobility issues

                Truss therefore must travel to Balmoral to become prime minister, a round-trip of around a thousand miles, rather than the two-mile round-trip that prime ministers usually enjoy

                By Dan Coombs  Facundo Pellistri has secured a major boost after being named in Manchester United’s Europa League squad
            </p>

            <p>
                He did feature for United in pre-season, scoring in the 4-0 victory over Liverpool in Bangkok in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latter is perennially injured, while William battled injury during pre-season and did not fly out on tour

            <p>
                Axel Tuanzebe did not play a pre-season game, although he did initially travel on tour before flying back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was named in the squad, as extra back-up, United’s fifth choice centre-back

            <p>
                The latter is perennially injured, while William battled injury during pre-season and did not fly out on tour

                Now, according to SPORT, Barcelona are also planning on making a huge investment to sign a new right-back in the summer of 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Catalans brought in a new right-back this summer, signing Hector Bellerin on a free transfer on the deadline day

                On top of that, Sergi Roberto’s contract also stands to run out next year, which means the Blaugrana will be without a right-back on the roster
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, plans are already underway to bring in a top-notch right-sided full-back in the summer of next year
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I can’t give everyone permanent posts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I’m not going to give you false promises,” Khairy told the first town hall on the Health White Paper in Kuching, Sarawak, yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before this, in the contract system, permanent positions for doctors, dentists and pharmacists in the public health care sector were only created when someone retired
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, despite MMA’s call for MOH to make public the selection criteria for permanent positions for government doctors, Khairy did not commit to this at yesterday’s town hall

                More info Cristiano Ronaldo made clear his unhappiness to his team-mate Bruno Fernandes after the Manchester United midfielder failed to pass the Portuguese star during their clash with Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo was brought off the bench by Erik ten Hag and took only minutes to become frustrated with his compatriot when the hosts had a chance to score
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 37-year-old was summoned from the bench with his side leading 2-1, replacing Jadon Sancho after Marcus Rashford after his team-mate had put United back in front.  And he felt he had a chance to score just minutes after coming on, with Fernandes pouncing on an error from Aaron Ramsdale after a poor pass out to Oleksandr Zinchenko
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fernandes had the chance to square it to Ronaldo, who would have had a simple tap-in if the playmaker passed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo had the chance to break in one on one with Ramsdale, only for Fred to overhit the pass and again, Ronaldo could hardly contain his emotions

                More info Cristiano Ronaldo made clear his unhappiness to his team-mate Bruno Fernandes after the Manchester United midfielder failed to pass the Portuguese star during their clash with Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo was brought off the bench by Erik ten Hag and took only minutes to become frustrated with his compatriot when the hosts had a chance to score
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 37-year-old was summoned from the bench with his side leading 2-1, replacing Jadon Sancho after Marcus Rashford after his team-mate had put United back in front.  And he felt he had a chance to score just minutes after coming on, with Fernandes pouncing on an error from Aaron Ramsdale after a poor pass out to Oleksandr Zinchenko
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fernandes had the chance to square it to Ronaldo, who would have had a simple tap-in if the playmaker passed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo had the chance to break in one on one with Ramsdale, only for Fred to overhit the pass and again, Ronaldo could hardly contain his emotions

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 5 — PAS should not be put in a position where it can play “kingmaker” in deciding the next federal government, Opposition Leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That’s PAS’ stand, in my view that’s a dangerous approach because it can become some form of a threat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “What we want is a party that presents a clear policy

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Kedah Mentri Besar Datuk Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor who is also PAS election director said his party intends to contest 80 parliamentary seats and win at least half so that no other party can form a government without it

                This was after High Court judge, Datuk Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid allowed the Attorney General's Chambers' (AGC) objection to the leave application for a judicial review filed by Emilia, 43, as the applicant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Federal counsel Mohammad Sallehuddin Md Ali, representing the AGC, said the court ruled that the Syariah Court has the jurisdiction to initiate committal proceedings as enshrined in the Administration of Islamic Law (Federal Territories) Act 1993 and the Syariah Court Civil Procedure (Federal Territories) Act 1998
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Proceedings and decisions of the Syariah Court cannot be reviewed by the Civil Court based on Article 121 (1A) of the Federal Constitution," he said when contacted Monday (Sept 5)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Mohammad Sallehuddin, the court also found that the leave for judicial review was filed outside the set period, as the Syariah Court's decision on the committal order was made on Feb 9, whereas Emilia filed her application on June 8
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the judicial review application, Emilia did not live or reside in the Federal Territory when the hadhanah (custody) proceeding was filed at the Kuala Lumpur Syariah High Court on July 23, 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Emilia sought a declaration that the Kuala Lumpur Syariah High Court and Syariah Court of Appeal do not have jurisdiction to hear and punish any individual who contravenes the court, as it is the exclusive right of the civil courts at the Federal Court, Court of Appeal and High Court levels, according to Article 126 of the Federal Constitution

                All 11 of United's players touched the ball in the build-up to Antony's opening goal From that moment, Ten Hag abandoned the instruction for United to pass out from defence

                It might well prove the defining moment in United's season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last season, Rashford may well have missed the one-on-one opportunity against Aaron Ramsdale that restored United's lead at a time when Arsenal were well in the ascendancy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of which gives Ten Hag a dilemma
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All 11 of United's players touched the ball in the build-up to Antony's opening goal From that moment, Ten Hag abandoned the instruction for United to pass out from defence

                If it wasn't working, he cut you.  Since taking charge, Ten Hag has made the decision to bench Cristiano Ronaldo (left) Burley claimed that Ten Hag's ruthless mentality allowed him to make those key choices 'For me that is one of the big success stories in Dutch football is when it's not working for them generally their managers are very ruthless, they will make decisions

                And he [Ten Hag] has already shown it, but I don't think it was ever in doubt that he was going to make decisions.' However, Burley's co-pundit Shaka Hislop did not have the same confidence in Ten Hag.  He previously claimed that he did not believe the Red Devils boss had what it takes to turn United's fortunes around but he admitted that he had been proven wrong by Ten Hag's start to life at Old Trafford.  'Credit to Erik ten Hag,' Hislop said

            <p>
                I'm not sure he has the presence to make some of the big decisions that Manchester United need, that's what I said.  Burley's co-pundit Shaka Hislop admitted Ten Hag has 'proven me wrong on so many levels' 'He's proven me wrong on so many levels

            <p>
                You thought the only was to get Ronaldo out of that team is to sell him but he's still there and Ten Hag has stuck by his decision.  'I thought the football we have seen Manchester United play in this game and against Liverpool showed the best Manchester United can be.  'And credit to him, for getting the best out if Rashford, the best out of Dalot, for his defensive partnership, for leaving out Maguire.'  Antony's opener handed United a 1-0 lead at half-time, before Bukayo Saka leveled the scoreboard for Arsenal on the hour mark.  But Rashford scored twice in 10 minutes to shock the Gunners and hand Ten Hag his fourth successive Premier League win

                This follows a three-member Court of Appeal bench on Monday (Sept 5) dismissing his appeal to strike out three graft and five money-laundering charges against him in the ongoing trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the appellate court allowed Abdul Azeez’s application to strike out four money-laundering charges, due to the fact that it was not clear where the offence was stipulated, as it merely stated the Klang Valley, whereas the trial is held in Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the latest ruling, Abdul Azeez has managed to get four of the 10 money-laundering charges struck off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With this, Abdul Azeez's case in Kuala Lumpur is fixed for mention on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No decision was made, and we are instructed to receive the court’s decision,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the money-laundering charges, Abdul Azeez was charged with committing the offences in the Klang Valley between March 8, 2010 and Aug 30, 2018

                This follows a three-member Court of Appeal bench on Monday (Sept 5) dismissing his appeal to strike out three graft and five money-laundering charges against him in the ongoing trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the appellate court allowed Abdul Azeez’s application to strike out four money-laundering charges, due to the fact that it was not clear where the offence was stipulated, as it merely stated the Klang Valley, whereas the trial is held in Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the latest ruling, Abdul Azeez has managed to get four of the 10 money-laundering charges struck off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With this, Abdul Azeez's case in Kuala Lumpur is fixed for mention on Wednesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No decision was made, and we are instructed to receive the court’s decision,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the money-laundering charges, Abdul Azeez was charged with committing the offences in the Klang Valley between March 8, 2010 and Aug 30, 2018

                Foreign minister under Boris Johnson, Truss, 47, has promised to act quickly to tackle Britain's cost of living crisis, saying that within a week she will come up with a plan to tackle rising energy bills and securing future fuel supplies

            <p>
                Veteran Conservative lawmaker David Davis described the challenges she would take on as prime minister as "probably the second most difficult brief of post-war prime ministers" after Conservative Margaret Thatcher in 1979

                The party leaders do not deny that their position in the federal government was based on good fortune rather than electoral merit, with PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang crediting God for his party’s position now

                PAS deputy president Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man said the party has identified at least 27 seats — all currently held by PH — as key to his party’s success

                When Mohd Amar said that the prime minister could one day from PAS during the gathering for its election machinery, attendees erupted in cheers and genuine belief that the party would one day be in charge of Malaysia

                Party election director Muhammad Sanusi, during the last day of the Muktamar, set the goal for the party to become preeminent in 2050

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Lisandro Martinez was substituted as a precaution during the closing stages of Manchester United’s win over Arsenal on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Martinez put in a dominant display at the heart of United’s defence against the Gunners, who were themselves interested in signing the defender from Ajax during the transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal dominated long periods of Sunday’s absorbing contest but Martinez played a key role in limiting Mikel Arteta’s side to a handful of clear-cut chances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Arsenal manager felt his side deserved to emerge from Old Trafford with at least a point but Scholes insisted Arsenal’s domination of possession represented a meaningless statistic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'A worry!' Paul Scholes names the one player Man Utd could struggle without 'He's a handful!' - Roy Keane singles out Man Utd star for praise after Arsenal win Gary Neville blasts Mikel Arteta's 'strange' decision that cost Arsenal against Man Utd ‘There are so many teams in these big games where they come away from Old Trafford a lot of times in big games wondering how have we not won, we’ve played great
            </p>

                BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Lisandro Martinez was substituted as a precaution during the closing stages of Manchester United’s win over Arsenal on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Martinez put in a dominant display at the heart of United’s defence against the Gunners, who were themselves interested in signing the defender from Ajax during the transfer window

Paul Scholes names the one player Man Utd could struggle without 'He's a handful!' - Roy Keane singles out Man Utd star for praise after Arsenal win Gary Neville blasts Mikel Arteta's 'strange' decision that cost Arsenal against Man Utd ‘There are so many teams in these big games where they come away from Old Trafford a lot of times in big games wondering how have we not won, we’ve played great

                This season however, he’s drawn a blank in four of their opening six
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s been tough to identify a solid cause of his slow start, yet one of the theories has been centred around a different role he has played in Jurgen Klopp's side this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So far this season, the 30-year-old is averaging 43.8 touches per 90, down from 51.6 last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This change in the mechanics of how Liverpool’s front three operate means Salah should in theory play a different role than what he has in the past
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last season, Klopp would usually play a more conservative profile in his right-sided No.8 role, someone like Jordan Henderson
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For much of this season though, he’s been using Harvey Elliott

                This season however, he’s drawn a blank in four of their opening six
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s been tough to identify a solid cause of his slow start, yet one of the theories has been centred around a different role he has played in Jurgen Klopp's side this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So far this season, the 30-year-old is averaging 43.8 touches per 90, down from 51.6 last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This change in the mechanics of how Liverpool’s front three operate means Salah should in theory play a different role than what he has in the past
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last season, Klopp would usually play a more conservative profile in his right-sided No.8 role, someone like Jordan Henderson
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For much of this season though, he’s been using Harvey Elliott

                Rahmat Mohamed Hazlan, one of their lawyers, when contacted on Monday (Sept 5), confirmed the court has fixed for further case management for the appeal as the records of appeal are not ready
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The appeal was set for case management today before Court of Appeal deputy registrar Tan Chai Wei

            <p>
                On June 21, this year, the Shah Alam High Court had acquitted and discharged Samirah, 47, who is Nazrin's widow and the two teenagers aged 19 and 16 after finding that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against the trio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On June 23, this year, the Attorney General's Chambers filed its notice of appeal against the High Court's decision to acquit Samirah and the teenagers on the murder charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, on June 30 this year, Samirah and the teenagers also filed an appeal to challenge certain finding of facts by the High Court including the findings that the fire which broke out in Nazrin's room was "done deliberately"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court judge, in his oral judgment, had said the court accepted the testimonies of the Kuala Lumpur fire and rescue department director Edwin Galan Teruki and investigating officer Halim Zulkefeli, in which they concluded that the fire was deliberately lit

                Rahmat Mohamed Hazlan, one of their lawyers, when contacted on Monday (Sept 5), confirmed the court has fixed for further case management for the appeal as the records of appeal are not ready
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The appeal was set for case management today before Court of Appeal deputy registrar Tan Chai Wei
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On June 21, this year, the Shah Alam High Court had acquitted and discharged Samirah, 47, who is Nazrin's widow and the two teenagers aged 19 and 16 after finding that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against the trio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On June 23, this year, the Attorney General's Chambers filed its notice of appeal against the High Court's decision to acquit Samirah and the teenagers on the murder charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, on June 30 this year, Samirah and the teenagers also filed an appeal to challenge certain finding of facts by the High Court including the findings that the fire which broke out in Nazrin's room was "done deliberately"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court judge, in his oral judgment, had said the court accepted the testimonies of the Kuala Lumpur fire and rescue department director Edwin Galan Teruki and investigating officer Halim Zulkefeli, in which they concluded that the fire was deliberately lit

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 5 — PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang was the very reason why his party was not making headway outside of Malay-Muslim constituencies, DAP’s Lim Kit Siang said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim again challenged Hadi, who is the prime minister’s special envoy to the Middle East, to deny if he was banned from visiting Saudi Arabia and possibly other countries in the region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On August 20, Abdul Hadi accused non-Muslims and non-Bumiputera of being the “roots of corruption” in the country on his Facebook page
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim previously questioned if Abdul Hadi had been barred from Saudi Arabia last year following the latter’s absence from the entourage during then-prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin’s visit to the kingdom and the United Arab Emirates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Saudi Arabia has not made any announcement specifically about Hadi, the kingdom along with several other Arab countries previously listed the International Union of Muslim Scholars (IUMS) group as a terrorist organisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hadi is a vice-president of the IUMS and an active contributor to the group’s discourse.

                On August 20, Abdul Hadi accused non-Muslims and non-Bumiputera of being the “roots of corruption” in the country on his Facebook page
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim previously questioned if Abdul Hadi had been barred from Saudi Arabia last year following the latter’s absence from the entourage during then-prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin’s visit to the kingdom and the United Arab Emirates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Saudi Arabia has not made any announcement specifically about Hadi, the kingdom along with several other Arab countries previously listed the International Union of Muslim Scholars (IUMS) group as a terrorist organisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hadi is a vice-president of the IUMS and an active contributor to the group’s discourse.

                Man Utd renew their rivalries with Arsenal this weekend as they attempt to halt the Gunners' flawless start to the new campaign and the Red Devils could certainly do with an infamous Sir Alex Ferguson speech to help them towards victory  In-form Manchester United welcome Arsenal on Sunday aiming to secure their fourth consecutive Premier League victory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the more famous matches between the Red Devils and the Gunners was arguably the 1999 FA Cup replay at Villa Park - a game made famous by Ryan Giggs’ stunning solo goal to book United’s place in the final of the competition  Whilst many will have seen the Welshman’s strike on many occasions since that showdown, some might not know how Sir Alex Ferguson managed to get his side motivated for the game with his pre-match speech to the entire United squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It was the best game of football I've ever played in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of the Man United players say the same." Sir Alex’s infamous teamtalk certainly appeared to work as the Red Devils edged out Arsenal to book a place in the final and they would eventually go on to lift the trophy - the first part of an unprecedented treble
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It remains to be seen whether Ten Hag attempts to emulate the legendary United manager but it certainly wouldn’t be the most unwise action to take as the Red Devils try to topple the Gunners once more

                Man Utd renew their rivalries with Arsenal this weekend as they attempt to halt the Gunners' flawless start to the new campaign and the Red Devils could certainly do with an infamous Sir Alex Ferguson speech to help them towards victory  In-form Manchester United welcome Arsenal on Sunday aiming to secure their fourth consecutive Premier League victory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the more famous matches between the Red Devils and the Gunners was arguably the 1999 FA Cup replay at Villa Park - a game made famous by Ryan Giggs’ stunning solo goal to book United’s place in the final of the competition  Whilst many will have seen the Welshman’s strike on many occasions since that showdown, some might not know how Sir Alex Ferguson managed to get his side motivated for the game with his pre-match speech to the entire United squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It was the best game of football I've ever played in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of the Man United players say the same." Sir Alex’s infamous teamtalk certainly appeared to work as the Red Devils edged out Arsenal to book a place in the final and they would eventually go on to lift the trophy - the first part of an unprecedented treble
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It remains to be seen whether Ten Hag attempts to emulate the legendary United manager but it certainly wouldn’t be the most unwise action to take as the Red Devils try to topple the Gunners once more

                About Us Advertise VATICAN CITY, Sept 4 — Thousands of people are expected to gather in St Peter's Square today as Pope Francis presides over the beatification of John Paul I, the so-called "Smiling Pope" who led the Catholic Church for just 33 days before dying in contested circumstances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                John Paul I, the son of a bricklayer from the Dolomite mountains and a particularly warm and pastoral figure, was elected pope on August 26, 1978, at the age of 65
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His death sparked intense speculation as to the cause, from suicide — he seemed reluctant to take on the position of pope — to murder, allegedly by those who opposed his plans to reform the church, particularly the powerful Vatican bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Born on October 17, 1912, in the northern Italian town of Canale d'Agordo, John Paul I rose to become Patriarch of Venice, Cardinal and then head of the Catholic Church
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among the most recent popes, John XXIII (1958-1963), Paul VI (1963-1978) and John Paul II (1978-2005) were proclaimed saints
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The predecessor of Pope Francis, Benedict XVI, is still alive and living in the Vatican after resigning in 2013

                A manager at a money changer company, known only as Saiful, said business had been affected by about 25%

                “Some people, especially young travellers, prefer cashless transactions over ewallets

            <p>
                That’s not really affecting our business because ewallets have transaction limits

            <p>
                But local money changers are also joining the cashless revolution

            <p>
                He said the money remittance industry, which was not spared by the Covid-19 pandemic, was making a remarkable recovery
            </p>

                Abdul Hadi could not understand Umno members better their own leader, Shahril said after the PAS chief disputed Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi’s rejection of their political cooperation

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 — Barisan Nasional was not seeking an early general election to protect its leaders but to “save” Malaysians from being manipulated by the coalition’s rivals, Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He insisted Umno’s increasingly persistent demand for the general election to be held how was wholly unrelated to the criminal cases against BN leaders, which coincidentally included him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While he did not name these rivals, his reference to the 2018 general election indicated that he meant Pakatan Harapan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said the country has faced failure after failure since the May 9, 2018 general election and that this must be prevented from happening again for the country’s sake
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid’s Umno has repeatedly urged Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to call for an early general election, but amplified this when Datuk Seri Najib Razak was sent to prison last month after losing his final appeal against his SRC International conviction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The juxtaposition has allowed critics to suggest that Umno’s growing desire for a general election now, before one is due next September, was to prevent more of its so-called “court cluster” from being convicted.

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Sept 3 — The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said yesterday that it has ordered the recall of a type of Malaysian-made soy sauce after it detected a type of additive that exceeded the regulatory limit for sauces here

            <p>
                The additive — which it identified as benzoic acid — was not declared on the food packaging of the Hand Flower Brand soy sauce

            <p>
                This is especially because soy sauce is “not a staple food consumed at high levels”, it added

            <p>

                This was followed on July 7 by Kalwant Singh, 32, being executed in Singapore for drug trafficking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shanmugam said it was understandable that there would be people speaking out against the mandatory death sentence, but highlighted what he said were thousands of lives and families destroyed by drug traffickers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Nearly seven out of 10 Singaporeans or 70% of our people say that mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking is appropriate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When talking about murder, nearly 80% say there must be the mandatory death penalty,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia imposed a moratorium on the death sentence in 2018
            </p>

                This was followed on July 7 by Kalwant Singh, 32, being executed in Singapore for drug trafficking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shanmugam said it was understandable that there would be people speaking out against the mandatory death sentence, but highlighted what he said were thousands of lives and families destroyed by drug traffickers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Nearly seven out of 10 Singaporeans or 70% of our people say that mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking is appropriate

            <p>
                When talking about murder, nearly 80% say there must be the mandatory death penalty,” he said

                Malaysia imposed a moratorium on the death sentence in 2018

                The 23-year-old is currently in the prime of his career, and would have been a superb signing for United

                It won’t be a surprise if the club make a fresh move for him in January

                Ahead of Saturday’s Merseyside derby, Jurgen Klopp had some positive news on the availability of two key players in Friday’s pre-match press conference

            <p>
                You’re not wrong, Jurgen! The boss has expressed his delight at potentially being able to call upon both Darwin Nunez and Diogo Jota in Saturday’s Merseyside derby, in what would be the first time the Reds have had five attackers available this season
            </p>

                You’re not wrong, Jurgen! The boss has expressed his delight at potentially being able to call upon both Darwin Nunez and Diogo Jota in Saturday’s Merseyside derby, in what would be the first time the Reds have had five attackers available this season

                At the same time, Annuar said as mentioned by Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, the offer is open to other industry players interested in acquiring a stake in DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, we must remain on track,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was reported recently that Maxis Bhd and U Mobile Sdn Bhd had decided not to take a stake in DNB for the 5G programme
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Four MNOs, namely Celcom Axiata Bhd, Digi.com Bhd, YTL Communications Sdn Bhd (YES) and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) still stand by their respective decisions to be part of the programme
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Government property is also ours,” he said.

                In a video clip lasting more than one minute, the student claimed that he had spent almost two years completing the study, and was disappointed when his study was stolen by the university

                Virgil van Dijk has been criticised for his defending away at Fulham and Man United this term But he is averaging 0.6 tackles per game - level with the 2019-20 title-winning season and more than the 0.5 last season -  while his average of five aerial duels is only bettered by the 6.6 he managed three seasons ago.  That has given him an aerial duel success of 72 per cent, not quite at last season's tally of 77.5 per cent but far clear of the 63.2 per cent he recorded in 2020-21
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has attempted more passes in both halves than in any other recent season but his accuracy numbers are slightly down on previous campaigns at 76.5 per cent in the opposition half and 92.7 per cent in his own half
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, his accuracy in his own half of 87.9 per cent is commendable but not in the 90s which he has managed since 2019-20
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The man who was the joint-winner of the Golden Boot last season currently has a minutes per goal ratio of 225, well above his next highest of 152 in 2019-20
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He is averaging just 2.8 per game so far this season, well below last season's 4.5 and the next highest of 3.7 in 2020-21
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salah is attempting 4.8 dribbles per game, above the 4.4 of last season while the numbers in the previous season failed to surpass three.  The number of shots Mohamed Salah is averaging per 90 minutes this term has fallen sharply The dribble success rate however stands at 33.3 per cent, which is the lowest of any of the three previous seasons and well off the 53.2 per cent he managed in the triumphant 2019-20 campaign

                Will the 70 per cent be divided among the remaining MNOs? The government still holds to the principle that the 5G network needs to be jointly developed with local MNOs and maintains its decision to not be the majority shareholder in DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is in line with the request from domestic MNOs that they hold equity interest in DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government welcomes the decision by the four MNOs which are still committed to develop the 5G network with DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the 70 per cent equity in DNB, we are considering whether it will be divided among the four MNOs, or for the remaining shares to be held by the government, but not at the level of a majority shareholding in DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Government policy is that domestic MNOs will get priority, however, if there is a balance of outstanding shares to be subscribed, the government will not reject the possibility of offering DNB shares to foreign MNOs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the MNOs that did not subscribe to DNB shares, they can still offer 5G access via the 5G access agreement

                Will the 70 per cent be divided among the remaining MNOs? The government still holds to the principle that the 5G network needs to be jointly developed with local MNOs and maintains its decision to not be the majority shareholder in DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is in line with the request from domestic MNOs that they hold equity interest in DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government welcomes the decision by the four MNOs which are still committed to develop the 5G network with DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the 70 per cent equity in DNB, we are considering whether it will be divided among the four MNOs, or for the remaining shares to be held by the government, but not at the level of a majority shareholding in DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Government policy is that domestic MNOs will get priority, however, if there is a balance of outstanding shares to be subscribed, the government will not reject the possibility of offering DNB shares to foreign MNOs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the MNOs that did not subscribe to DNB shares, they can still offer 5G access via the 5G access agreement
            </p>

                In a notice of appeal filed today at the Court of Appeal, Rosmah said she wanted to appeal against Zaini’s decision yesterday which rejected her application to recuse or remove him from the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the other notice of appeal also filed today at the Court of Appeal, Rosmah said she was dissatisfied with Zaini’s entire decision yesterday in her bribery case, where the judge convicted her and sentenced her to jail and to pay a fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In other words, Rosmah is appealing against both the conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This means that the total jail time Rosmah could potentially have to serve is 40 years, if she does not succeed in her appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As Rosmah’s lawyers yesterday asked for the 10-year jail sentence and RM970 million fine to be suspended while she pursues an appeal and as the prosecution did not object to the request, the High Court yesterday allowed the suspension or stay of sentence until the Court of Appeal decides on her appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosmah did not have to pay additional bail to avoid being in lock-up while pursuing her appeal, as the High Court allowed the previous RM2 million bail already posted to be extended to serve as her bail until the Court of Appeal decides on her appeal

            </p>
            
            <p>
                As Rosmah’s lawyers yesterday asked for the 10-year jail sentence and RM970 million fine to be suspended while she pursues an appeal and as the prosecution did not object to the request, the High Court yesterday allowed the suspension or stay of sentence until the Court of Appeal decides on her appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosmah did not have to pay additional bail to avoid being in lock-up while pursuing her appeal, as the High Court allowed the previous RM2 million bail already posted to be extended to serve as her bail until the Court of Appeal decides on her appeal
            </p>

                Sessions Court judge Rozina Ayob made the ruling on Friday (Sept 2) after finding that the prosecution had established a prima facie case on the three graft charges Bung Moktar faces and three abetment charges Zizie faces
            </p>

                Asked by Sivananthan, MACC officer Haniff reaffirmed his previous testimony that his investigation was focused on changes to the 1MDB audit report on orders from Najib to Ambrin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Haniff agreed that this meant that the basis of his investigation was based on his understanding that Ambrin had been instructed to make changes to the 1MDB audit report, and agreed this was why he carried out investigations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Haniff agreed that Ambrin’s testimony of making amendments at his own discretion and the claim of instructions being given to Ambrin to make amendments were two different things, also agreeing that Ambrin would have the right as auditor-general then to make any amendments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Later when asked by Najib’s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Haniff agreed that the auditor in this case is the auditor-general Ambrin and his team and that 1MDB is the auditee and has to be represented by actual individuals as it is a company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s and Arul Kanda’s lawyers have during the trial tried to suggest that this may not be the final exit conference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Haniff today insisted that the December 2015 exit conference was the actual one held, and said a subsequent February 24, 2016 meeting was not an exit conference

            <p>
                But Haniff today insisted that the December 2015 exit conference was the actual one held, and said a subsequent February 24, 2016 meeting was not an exit conference

                ■ Turning the Mundane Task of Game Balancing into a Breeze! When we talk about game creation, oftentimes most of us would first picture the arts and game play, essentially the catchiest parts of a game

            <p>

            <p>
                Good News! RPG Maker Unite comes with a new feature called “Auto-Guide” that can alleviate this time constraint hurdle in the game creation process!  ■ Convenient and Easy to Use! Simply Enter Some Parameters and Let the System Do the Hard Work! Aimed at helping game creators tuning game balance more easily, it is only natural that the Auto-Guide being super easy to use – and indeed it is!  Initially, simply set some Common Settings parameters such as Max Level, Estimated Clear Level, Max EXP, and Max HP, and the user is largely ready to go! The system will use these values as basis to compute a suggested balance for many parameters common in RPG making!  —Setting some initial parameters for the Auto-Guide to compute and auto-fill parameters such as Enemy Stats! —At the click of a button, enemy stats can be auto-generated using the Auto-Guide! ■ Auto-Guide is Also Available for Setting Class Growth Tendency and Equipment Stats! Auto-Guide also works for auto-setting the parameters for the classes assigned to party members
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Simply set some basic, common parameters, and check the box telling the system you want to use Auto-Guide, all values and multipliers are automatically filled for you!  —Using Auto-Guide for battle related skill stats! ■ Addon Manager to Help Control and Manage Modifications! While RPG Maker Unite can be modified directly in the Unity editor via C#, many users have voiced that a feature similar to the Plugin Manager found in previous RPG Maker titles that can switch on and off modifications, is much more convenient and beginner friendly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instructions written by the addon authors are also displayed here too! ■ Developer Log #6 Now Available! In Developer Log #6, we will explain in more details on how to use Auto-Guide will work! If you are curious, please give it a read!

                It was only recently that there was a leak about a new Xbox Game Pass Friends and Family package
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From the official Xbox webpage, the Xbox Game Pass Friends and Family package can add up to five individual accounts (including the primary holder) and each account has its own Xbox profile and games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These five accounts don't need to be in the same household and everyone can play it at the same time, same game as well as playing together
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That said, this new Game Pass is only applicable for gamers who are living in the same country, though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, Microsoft is testing the plan in Ireland and Columbia at the price of €21.99 per month or 49,900 COP per month respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Malaysia, our currency may cost lower since we are paying RM15 per month for the Xbox PC Game Pass. The Xbox Game Pass Friends and Family plan is the same as the Xbox PC Game Pass, which allows gamers to play Xbox games on day one, EA Play membership and others.  For now, this seems to be for Xbox gamers but we hope that it can be implemented for Xbox PC Game Pass for Southeast Asia countries such as ours

                About Us Advertise BANGKOK, Sept 2 — Malaysian fugitive businessman Teow Wooi Huat is expected to be deported to China soon, though Malaysian police too had requested for his repatriation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Now, he (Teow) is under the custody of Immigration Police and (we are) preparing to send him to China,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia and China are after Teow who is on the Interpol Red Notice list for questioning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Teow was under Thai Immigration Police custody after his visa was revoked on July 22, and since then he has been awaiting deportation by the Thai authorities
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the design front, the Elite 5 looks identical to the Elite 4 Active and Elite 3 models, including the charging case design
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The battery life on the Elite 5 earbuds also appears promising
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Elite 5 are Jabra's latest ANC earbuds while managing to not break the bank

                FROM the depths of crisis to fifth in the Premier League in the space of ten days, Erik Ten Hag’s Manchester United’s have lift-off.  And after Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford continued to fuel this min-revival, can the United duo now earn a place on the plane to Qatar in November?  Sancho netted for the second time in United’s three-match winning run, after a classy assist from Rashford, as United deepened the air of despair around Leicester and piled further pressure on Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers.  Gareth Southgate had claimed that Sancho and Rashford had a long way to go to force their way back into his World Cup plans, as both suffered an alarming plunge in form last season.  Rashford enjoyed a bright first half here but struggled after the break and may still have a lot more convincing to do but he is a favourite of Southgate, who needs more goalscoring options.  And with £82million Antony newly arrived from Ajax, competition for places in the United forward is about to get stiffer.  Transfer deadline has now passed without Cristiano Ronaldo getting away from Old Trafford as well.  So Ten Hag has plenty of options and a certain level of optimism is creeping into a team which was humiliated in that horrific first half at Brentford last month.  The transformative victory over Liverpool, when Sancho and Rashford both scored, has now been followed up by back-to-back away wins.  Yet Leicester were poor, they are a team which looks to have had the lifeblood sucked out of them after a miserable transfer window.

                But United’s opener, midway through the first half, was sweet in its simplicity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was a mark of Leicester’s improved threat that Ten Hag brought on Casemiro, in place of winger Anthony Elanga, just before the hour mark.  Maddison, though, was beginning to cause United serious problems and he was wrestled over by Scott McTominay just outside the area but this time his dead-ball effort was charged down
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo arrived in place of Sancho midway through the second half and he soon attempted a bicycle kick from an angle, yet duffed his effort wide across goal.

                Football Club News, Analysis, History, Schedule, Rumours                     Manchester United’s £50 Million man, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, has been left unhappy with the club’s handling of his transfer situation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan-Bissaka was looking for a move away from Old Trafford this summer after being dropped from the side for Diogo Dalot by new manager Erik ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jonathan Shrager has tweeted, “Those around Wan-Bissaka have been concerned Aaron’s being kept at Manchester United just in case Dalot gets injured
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His representation have been trying to facilitate a move for weeks, but the club has refused various offers, maintaining throughout that he isn’t for sale or loan.” Manchester United had been interested in potential right back replacements, such as Sergino Dest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag has spoken directly to Aaron, ensuring that he still has a chance to impress at Manchester United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag seems to pick Diogo Dalot more often due to his attacking ability

                Football Club News, Analysis, History, Schedule, Rumours                     Manchester United’s £50 Million man, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, has been left unhappy with the club’s handling of his transfer situation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan-Bissaka was looking for a move away from Old Trafford this summer after being dropped from the side for Diogo Dalot by new manager Erik ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jonathan Shrager has tweeted, “Those around Wan-Bissaka have been concerned Aaron’s being kept at Manchester United just in case Dalot gets injured
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His representation have been trying to facilitate a move for weeks, but the club has refused various offers, maintaining throughout that he isn’t for sale or loan.” Manchester United had been interested in potential right back replacements, such as Sergino Dest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag has spoken directly to Aaron, ensuring that he still has a chance to impress at Manchester United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag seems to pick Diogo Dalot more often due to his attacking ability

                After a leak revealed Xbox Game Pass Friends & Family branding over the weekend, Microsoft has gone official with its new plan and revealed its pricing in Ireland and Colombia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new subscription will allow Xbox Game Pass members to share with up to four other friends or family members at €21.99 per month in Ireland, and 49,900 COP in Colombia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Microsoft isn’t restricting this new Game Pass plan to just family members, and the only restriction is that people who are added to the Friends & Family plan need to be in the same country
            </p>

                Microsoft is currently testing this new Xbox Game Pass Friends & Family plan in Ireland and Colombia, with pricing at €21.99 per month instead of the regular €12.99 per month for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That works out to less than €5 per month per person to share all the usual Xbox Game Pass Ultimate benefits

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The primary rear camera for both phones is a 50MP unit accompanied by an 8MP ultrawide angle camera and a depth sensor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Nova 10 has a relatively middle-of-the-road 4,000mAh battery, bumped up to 4,500mAh on the Pro model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition to the phones, Huawei has a new tablet with an 11-inch 2560×1600 OLED display and a 120Hz refresh rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the back are a 13MP primary sensor and 8MP ultrawide angle camera, while the front features a 16MP video camera

                @SkylledDev Google has laid out some of what Android fans can expect from the September 2022 Google Play system updates, including improvements to Kids Space on tablets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In recent months, Google has grouped together Play Services, the Play Store, and the “Google Play system updates” introduced in Android 10
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The easiest way to check whether you need to update Google Play Services on your phone is to follow a direct link to the app’s Play Store listing and update from there, if available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To update the Play Store, tap your avatar in the corner, then “Settings.” Under the “About” section, you’ll see an option to “Update Play Store.” Meanwhile, Google Play system updates can be found through the Settings app, under About phone > Android version > Google Play system update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the month of September still a day away from beginning¸ Google has already shared the first batch of Google System Update patch notes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time as these updates were made, Google also added some more information about last month’s Google Play System update

                @SkylledDev Google has laid out some of what Android fans can expect from the September 2022 Google Play system updates, including improvements to Kids Space on tablets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In recent months, Google has grouped together Play Services, the Play Store, and the “Google Play system updates” introduced in Android 10
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The easiest way to check whether you need to update Google Play Services on your phone is to follow a direct link to the app’s Play Store listing and update from there, if available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To update the Play Store, tap your avatar in the corner, then “Settings.” Under the “About” section, you’ll see an option to “Update Play Store.” Meanwhile, Google Play system updates can be found through the Settings app, under About phone > Android version > Google Play system update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the month of September still a day away from beginning¸ Google has already shared the first batch of Google System Update patch notes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time as these updates were made, Google also added some more information about last month’s Google Play System update

                AMD has announced the Ryzen 7000 series desktop processors along with the AM5 socket and the 600-series motherboard chipsets, all set to release on Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD says that compared to Zen 3, Zen 4 brings 13 per cent instruction per clock (IPC) uplift on average, resulting in a 29 per cent single-thread performance gain over the Ryzen 5000 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD says that the Ryzen 7000 series processors are not only faster but also more power efficient
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zen 4’s AVX-512 instruction support is a first for AMD processors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The launch price of the Ryzen 9 7900 series processors is on par with the launch price of its Ryzen 9 5900 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These Ryzen 7 processors are priced just above the current retail pricing of the 12-core Intel Core i7-12700K and the 10-core Core i5-12600K

                AMD has announced the Ryzen 7000 series desktop processors along with the AM5 socket and the 600-series motherboard chipsets, all set to release on Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD says that compared to Zen 3, Zen 4 brings 13 per cent instruction per clock (IPC) uplift on average, resulting in a 29 per cent single-thread performance gain over the Ryzen 5000 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD says that the Ryzen 7000 series processors are not only faster but also more power efficient
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zen 4’s AVX-512 instruction support is a first for AMD processors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The launch price of the Ryzen 9 7900 series processors is on par with the launch price of its Ryzen 9 5900 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These Ryzen 7 processors are priced just above the current retail pricing of the 12-core Intel Core i7-12700K and the 10-core Core i5-12600K

                The company’s new Glasses T1 put a Full HD OLED screen in front of each of your eyes and were revealed today during IFA and on Lenovo’s virtual showcase

            <p>
                This wearable private display, as Lenovo puts it, is very much like other consumer smart glasses, including TCL’s NxtWear Air, which puts two 1080p micro-OLED screens in front of your eyes, just like Lenovo’s T1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lenovo is betting that mobile gamers will want these glasses, too, citing a Global Industry Analysts report that predicts a $160 billion global market for that industry by 2026
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you’d like to use the glasses with iOS devices like your iPhone, you’ll have to buy Lenovo’s HDMI adapter, as well as Apple’s Digital AV adapter — all because Apple still hasn’t moved on from its 10-year-old Lightning port
            </p>

                They also have built-in speakers in case you want only the video to be ultra-private

                Like many other display glasses, the Lenovo Glasses T1 will be released for the Chinese market first

                Here's all the biggest iPhone 14 leaks before launch The iPhone 14 is all set to be unveiled on September 7 at Apple’s Far Out event, and this promises to be the biggest iPhone launch in years.  We’re talking huge upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro series, a rumored new iPhone 14 Max model to replace the mini and more

                But you should be ready to pay more, as Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says Apple will charge $100 more for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max

                The next version of USB could be one of the fastest connectors we’ve seen yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The USB Promoter Group says that USB 4 version 2.0 will be capable of speeds up to 80 Gbps, double what the original USB 4, and even Thunderbolt 4, are capable of
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Joe Balich, a spokesperson for the USB-IF, confirmed that if I were to go out and buy a USB 4 cable right now that was rated for 40 Gbps, it would be able to do twice those speeds in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                USB has always been good about backward compatibility (and USB 4 version 2 is no exception), but being able to use the same cable and still reap the flagship benefit of the new spec is another level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the USB Promoter Group, which is made up of companies like Intel, Apple, Microsoft, HP, and Texas Instruments, the USB-C and power delivery specs will be updated to “enable this higher level of data performance.” The USB 4 version 2.0 specification will also apparently include updates that provide better speeds when you’re using USB 3.2 — the promotors group promises over 20 Gbps — as well as improved support for DisplayPort and PCIe since it’ll be using the latest version of those standards (the first USB 4 only let you use DisplayPort 1.4a when “tunneling,” or carrying DisplayPort and USB signals at the same time)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s a strange move to label this as just a “version 2.0” of USB 4 when the leap in speed definitely feels like it’d warrant being called USB 5

                We've known for a while that Sennheiser had a less expensive version of its Ambeo soundbar in the works, and the company took the opportunity at IFA 2022 to reveal the device

            <p>
                The Ambeo Soundbar Plus will run you $1,500, which is $1,000 less than the original Ambeo soundbar but it retains much of the same tech
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sennheiser says the Soundbar Plus will be able to analyze a room's acoustics to position several virtual speakers

            <p>
                Ambeo Soundbar Plus supports several music streaming platforms and protocols, including Apple AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The upcoming gaming phone, which has been leaked, is dubbed ROG Phone 6D
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TL;DR Based on the renders shared by 91Mobiles, Asus' ROG Phone 6D will be unchanged from the ROG Phone 6
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the top-tier ROG Phone 6D Ultimate version has a noticeable minor difference compared to the Phone 6 Pro that we've reviewed, particularly on its back that looks to house a pop-up or sliding mechanism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pricing and availability of ROG Phone 6D will be confirmed on the same date too

                At IFA 2022, Jabra is announcing the new $149 Elite 5 earbuds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the design, Jabra says they’ll provide “a discreet, comfortable, and compact fit.” The earbuds share a teardrop shape that’s similar to the rest of the current Elite series and have six mics onboard for enhanced voice call performance with wind suppression
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you’re a little mixed up on where Jabra’s current lineup stands — this company sure makes a lot of earbuds — here’s how it looks with today’s addition of the Elite 5

                At IFA 2022, Jabra is announcing the new $149 Elite 5 earbuds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the design, Jabra says they’ll provide “a discreet, comfortable, and compact fit.” The earbuds share a teardrop shape that’s similar to the rest of the current Elite series and have six mics onboard for enhanced voice call performance with wind suppression
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you’re a little mixed up on where Jabra’s current lineup stands — this company sure makes a lot of earbuds — here’s how it looks with today’s addition of the Elite 5

                After Samsung is done with the rudimentary tests, the firm moves towards durability tests on the Galaxy Z Fold 4

                The first test checks the water resistance using a specialized chamber

            <p>
                Devices that survive this test are then sent to the folding test bench where a robotic arm is responsible for folding and unfolding the phone so it can rule out any issues with the folding mechanism or the hinge itself

            <p>
                There is another specialized robot that is responsible for testing the side keys by pressing them repeatedly and the entire testing process ends with another water resistance test where the nozzles spray water at high pressure at unfolded Galaxy Z Fold 4 from all the angles and once that is done, the phone is completely submerged

            <p>
                Although the video does not show the Galaxy Z Flip 4 going through the same test, it does appear in the last water resistance test, which is enough reason for us to believe that Samsung is treating both phones the same way, and is pretty confident in the durability of these devices

                We have a plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, as we are expanding our business operations, we are looking to taking chargers out of the box and put them in the store so that our users are able to buy the chargers and continue using them even when they upgrade their devices.” Many of Oppo’s competitors have already cut the charger from the box contents, but they typically use USB Power Delivery so there is a wide variety of first and third-party chargers that you can use
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, VOOC is proprietary and Oppo does like to dial it up the power level fairly often, which requires new a charger
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But for now we’ll take them at their word – they have a plan and if that plan involves dropping the charger from entry-level and mid-range phones, that will probably be fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also, Oppo phones do support USB Power Delivery, although at a lower power level than the VOOC implementation (e.g
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                However, as we are expanding our business operations, we are looking to taking chargers out of the box and put them in the store so that our users are able to buy the chargers and continue using them even when they upgrade their devices.” Many of Oppo’s competitors have already cut the charger from the box contents, but they typically use USB Power Delivery so there is a wide variety of first and third-party chargers that you can use
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, VOOC is proprietary and Oppo does like to dial it up the power level fairly often, which requires new a charger
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But for now we’ll take them at their word – they have a plan and if that plan involves dropping the charger from entry-level and mid-range phones, that will probably be fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also, Oppo phones do support USB Power Delivery, although at a lower power level than the VOOC implementation (e.g

                Not only has HMD Global presented new Nokia smartphones today, but it has also introduced a new Android-powered tablet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, the UNISOC Tiger T610 in the T20 has made way for the UNISOC Tiger T612, which HMD Global complements with at least 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While HMD Global has included a relatively large battery, the Nokia T21 is only 7.5 mm thick and weighs approximately 465 g
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to HMD Global, the tablet will be compatible with Wacom Active ES 2.0 styluses, rather than a proprietary alternative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                HMD Global adds that a version with 128 GB of storage and LTE connectivity is coming to market, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As usual, HMD Global promises to provide two years of software updates for the Nokia T21, which should end when the company rolls out Android 14

                Additionally, the UNISOC Tiger T610 in the T20 has made way for the UNISOC Tiger T612, which HMD Global complements with at least 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While HMD Global has included a relatively large battery, the Nokia T21 is only 7.5 mm thick and weighs approximately 465 g

            <p>
                According to HMD Global, the tablet will be compatible with Wacom Active ES 2.0 styluses, rather than a proprietary alternative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                HMD Global adds that a version with 128 GB of storage and LTE connectivity is coming to market, too

            <p>
                As usual, HMD Global promises to provide two years of software updates for the Nokia T21, which should end when the company rolls out Android 14

                The reserved Bin Shen, who used to train under Rexy during his previous tenure as the national doubles coach (2005-2012), was humble and said he has a lot to learn from the legendary Indonesian

                Rexy’s role in allowing Bin Shen to come to the fore as a coach would also see one of BAM’s objectives achieved and Malaysia would start having quality coaches themselves to guide the national shuttlers in the future.

                Ben Van Beurden, CEO of Shell, poses for a photograph in London, Britain, October 8, 2019
            </p>

            <p>
                Sawan, a Canadian national who previously headed Shell's oil and gas production business and today oversees Shell's growth into low carbon energies as well as its giant gas business, is seen as the front-runner to succeed van Beurden but no decision has been made, one source said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Van Beurden has focused in recent months on Shell's historic headquarters relocation from The Hague to London at the start of 2022 as well as the energy crisis that has gripped the world in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Van Beurden seized on the downturn to acquire rival BG Group for $53 billion in 2016, catapulting Shell into a major gas producer and the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the collapse in energy demand in early 2020, van Beurden and his board decided to cut Shell's dividend, the world's largest at the time at around $15 billion, for the first time since World War Two

                Apple's current 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models launched in April 2021, making them the longest-lasting iPad Pro models to date

            <p>
                Refreshed ‌iPad Pro‌ models have been rumored for some time, and now, Australian carrier Optus has added ‌2022 iPad Pro‌ models to its internal stock keeping system, distinct from 2021 ‌iPad Pro‌ models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At present, there is no fourth-generation 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, with the latest model from 2021 being a third-generation model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Optus staff, the ‌2022 ‌iPad‌ Pro‌ models are not currently in stock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One such customer told MacRumors that two days after receiving order confirmation for the ‌2022 ‌iPad‌ Pro‌ model, they were contacted by a customer service representative who said that the fourth-generation 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ was out of stock, and that Optus could only offer the third-generation 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ at the current time – resulting in the creation of a new order confirmation for the 2021 model
            </p>

                If you were thinking of upgrading from the original Razer Kishi or iOS controller, then there are a few benefits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Compatibility for phones and connections aside, the design for both the Android and iOS Kishi V2 is nearly identical
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We noted in our review of the Kishi V2 for Android that while those mechanical buttons impressed on the Wolverine V2, on this smaller controller, a lack of travel makes them less impressive on the Kishi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The review also notes that the Kishi V2’s performance falls flat against a competing Lightning-only product, the $99 Backbone One
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Razer appears to have taken some hefty inspiration from its competition when designing the second generation of Kishi mobile controllers, though that mattered less for the Kishi V2 for Android as Backbone’s offering was designed for iOS users
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kishi V2 for iPhone requires iOS 15.4 or later and is compatible with models from the iPhone SE (first- and second-gen) through to the iPhone 13 series

                Earlier today, the Twitter account seen below published the two images depicting a prominent character from Assassin's Creed Mirage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What we can potentially glean from these images is that the new Assassin's Creed game might feature a quest called "The Forty Thieves." From the depiction of the quest in the new artwork, it seems this is a DLC quest, perhaps even a pre-order bonus for Ubisoft's upcoming game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either way, it could well be the case that both Assassin's Creed Mirage and this new Forty Thieves quest are unveiled by Ubisoft next week

            <p>
                The company is scheduled to hold a presentation on Saturday, September 10, and it's this event that's been heralded as unveiling the "future of Assassin's Creed." We can hardly think of a more convenient event for Mirage's grand debut.  There's also a rumoured stealth-focused Assassin's Creed spin-off game in the works from Ubisoft, which could be separate from Mirage.  Hirun Cryer is a freelance reporter and writer with Gamesradar+ based out of U.K

                This TV is the first Toshiba model to launch with Fire TV built-in here in the UK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s also support for Apple AirPlay available.  Like the QA5D, this 4K TV leverages Toshiba’s TRU Picture Engine, HDR10, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Sound by Onkyo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The addition of Fire TV also makes it possible to access a range of apps, including BBC iPlayer, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Now, Disney Plus, Amazon Music, Spotify and Live TV through Freeview Play.  Prices start at £369  The UK4D is a TV powered by Toshiba’s own operating system, though it also comes with Alexa built-in.  The mid-range model features a sleek frameless design, 4K HDR10 image quality and support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apps available on this model include Freeview Play, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube and Twitch.  Prices start at £229 Editorial independence means being able to give an unbiased verdict about a product or company, with the avoidance of conflicts of interest

                The new TCL 6-Series R655 supports a 144Hz refresh rate for PC gamers While TCL didn’t have much to show us back at CES, the makers of the competitively priced TCL 6-Series say that it’s got a new model for 2022 that gamers are going to love
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you haven’t heard of the TCL 6-Series before now, it’s a model that carries some serious clout in the AV community for its performance that punches well above its price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previous iterations of the TV — the TCL R625 and TCL R635 — continue to be strong picks for people who want a solid value TV, but the new R655 should offer improved performance compared to the previous versions

                TCL finally made a Roku TV with excellent gaming specs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One year, there’s a Roku version; the next year, we get a Google TV edition, and now, TCL is upgrading the Roku model again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the 2022 6-Series Roku TV, TCL is putting a big emphasis on gaming capabilities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the bottom of the screen, there’s now an ambient light sensor, and this addition allowed TCL to include Dolby Vision IQ on the 2022 6-Series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The built-in voice microphones from the Google TV 6-Series aren’t present on the new Roku model, but you can still use the included remote for voice commands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But now, the latest Roku version has leapfrogged that set with the upgrade to 144Hz VRR; I can’t help but predict that general navigation on the Roku 6-Series will be more fluid and snappy than on Google TV

                If you thought that Sony delayed the Xperia 5 IV until now to wait for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 to make its debut, you thought wrong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Where Sony usually shines though is the cameras, and with the Sony Xperia 5 IV, you’ll find a triple rear camera system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Xperia 5 IV also now comes with wireless charging as well as reverse wireless charging, features that were previously missing in the Xperia 5 III
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Xperia 5 IV has IP68 dust and water resistance too

                However, while Sony’s smartphones often feature some impressive specs, they tend to be priced pretty exorbitantly, and the same can be said of the Xperia 5 IV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year’s Sony Xperia 5 III meanwhile retailed in Malaysia for RM4,599 and we can probably expect to see a similar price tag when it does arrive in Malaysia later this year.

                I've grown too cynical to believe Metal Gear will come to the Switch

                I would love a remake..

                One ought to wonder why Konami would even bother if it's planning to release a brand new collection

                Would be great if we could rescue Metal Gear Solid 4 from the PS3 and Acid 1 & 2 from the PSP, too

                In response, Microsoft Gaming CEO and head of Xbox Phil Spencer has spelled out Microsoft’s position in a blog post today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Detailing Microsoft’s plans for gaming beyond just Xbox consoles, Spencer says the company will pursue a “principled path” in its approach to Xbox Game Pass and Call of Duty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Microsoft says it will make Overwatch, Diablo, and Call of Duty all available in Xbox Game Pass but not prevent games like Call of Duty from being available on PlayStation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That’s why, as we’ve said before, we are committed to making the same version of Call of Duty available on PlayStation on the same day the game launches elsewhere.” Spencer likens Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal to the company’s $2.5 billion acquisition of Minecraft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Brad Smith, Microsoft president and vice chair, is even more direct about the Call of Duty situation

            <p>
                I understand Microsoft still expects the deal to close fully in spring 2023, with many months ahead for competitors to voice concerns and Microsoft to argue for this giant acquisition

            <p>
                By Kyle Knight Ubisoft has announced that they will be delaying the decommissioning of older Assassin’s Creed titles by one month, reportedly due to the publisher wanting to “reduce disruption” for their player base
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decommissioning of older Ubisoft titles was due to take place on the 1st of September 2022, but has now been moved back by one month, to the 1st of October 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, the team has reportedly been forced to move the decommission date to the beginning of October, in order to make the process as smooth as possible for those still playing older titles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The publisher did express that DLC for single-player titles on PC, such as Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, Assassin’s Creed III (2012 release), Far Cry 3 and Splinter Cell Blacklist, will still be available to download and keep before the decommission date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ubisoft also states, “There will be no impact to the same single-player DLC on consoles, and you will continue to be able to download and play them after 1 October 2022”

It's not the whole picture though — make sure you're looking at what that company is doing to reduce emissions from other elements like deliveries and packaging (including single-use plastics) for a start, not to mention which of their other products aren't using recycled plastic

                Amazon says its own Kindle, Echo, Fire TV, Fire Tablet, and Smart Home devices "include up to 60 percent recycled molded plastic, up to 100 percent recycled fabrics, up to 100 percent recycled aluminum, and up to 70 percent recycled magnesium, depending on the product."  It's not the whole picture though — make sure you're looking at what that company is doing to reduce emissions from other elements like deliveries and packaging (including single-use plastics) for a start, not to mention which of their other products aren't using recycled plastic

                HMD’s Nokia has continued to roll out serviceable but unremarkable smartphones for the last few years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now it’s announced a new subscription plan that it says will “reward users” for keeping their phone for longer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, two devices (and they’re not even the new Nokia phones) will join Circular; The Nokia XR20 will cost £20 (roughly $23) per month with a £30 (around $35) setup fee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also the Nokia T10 LTE, an entry-level 8-inch tablet, for £10 (roughly $12) a month with the same £30 (around $35) setup fee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you return a phone to them, either when you upgrade or leave the service, the company will recycle or refurbish the device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will be longevity incentives for holding onto your Nokia phone for longer too, it’s just not a financial one

                HMD’s Nokia has continued to roll out serviceable but unremarkable smartphones for the last few years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now it’s announced a new subscription plan that it says will “reward users” for keeping their phone for longer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, two devices (and they’re not even the new Nokia phones) will join Circular; The Nokia XR20 will cost £20 (roughly $23) per month with a £30 (around $35) setup fee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also the Nokia T10 LTE, an entry-level 8-inch tablet, for £10 (roughly $12) a month with the same £30 (around $35) setup fee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you return a phone to them, either when you upgrade or leave the service, the company will recycle or refurbish the device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will be longevity incentives for holding onto your Nokia phone for longer too, it’s just not a financial one

                “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” star Joo Hyun Young has a breathtaking smile in her new pictorial for @star1! In the interview for the pictorial, Joo Hyun Young talked about her character Dong Geurami’s famous greeting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our humor was also on the same wavelength.” As the funniest cast member, Joo Hyun Young chose Ha Yun Kyung
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When I talk with her, I always laugh out loud to the point that I’m rolling over with laughter.”  Joo Hyun Young also shared, “Every time [Park Eun Bin] finished one scene, everyone would give a standing ovation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A new season of ‘SNL’ will start soon, but I’m at a loss for what to do then.”  Finally, Joo Hyun Young revealed that unlike her current image, she was actually a quiet student back in her school days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to those people that I attended school with, I was very soft-spoken and had an image of a gentle student.” Joo Hyun Young’s full interview and pictorial will be available through the September issue of @star1

                “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” star Joo Hyun Young has a breathtaking smile in her new pictorial for @star1! In the interview for the pictorial, Joo Hyun Young talked about her character Dong Geurami’s famous greeting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our humor was also on the same wavelength.” As the funniest cast member, Joo Hyun Young chose Ha Yun Kyung
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When I talk with her, I always laugh out loud to the point that I’m rolling over with laughter.”  Joo Hyun Young also shared, “Every time [Park Eun Bin] finished one scene, everyone would give a standing ovation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A new season of ‘SNL’ will start soon, but I’m at a loss for what to do then.”  Finally, Joo Hyun Young revealed that unlike her current image, she was actually a quiet student back in her school days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to those people that I attended school with, I was very soft-spoken and had an image of a gentle student.” Joo Hyun Young’s full interview and pictorial will be available through the September issue of @star1

                For starters, the telco has confirmed it will not invest in DNB just like what has been claimed by the Reuters report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DNB yesterday said that two out of six local telcos have pulled out from the shareholder agreement even though they have previously agreed to participate in it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Through the same statement, the company also said that its ability to deliver 5G service will not be affected by this decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because the 5G access is under a separate agreement altogether that has no link to the DNB’s equity agreement which is something that has been confirmed yesterday by the national 5G company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The telco has further confirmed that it is currently in the process of finalising the access agreement with DNB although no actual timeline was mentioned in today’s statement

            <p>
                Much like the 55-inch Play lightstrip explicitly made for TVs, the PC versions of the Play lightstrips provide flexible accent lighting that attaches to the back of your monitor

            <p>
                The new family of Play lightstrips can sync with other connected lighting in the Philips Hue ecosystem and will be available starting September 13th

            <p>
                The Play lightstrips for PC will be compatible with the existing Hue Sync desktop app and can work with the Play Sync box from Philips Hue, just like the larger lightstrips used with TVs, but they don’t require it
            </p>

                Last year, Sony announced the HT-A5000 soundbar

            <p>
                This year, the company has announced another soundbar that looks to be its little sibling, the Sony HT-A3000

            <p>
                If you make use of additional – and optional – speakers, then the soundbar will also take them into account during the calibration process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Sony HT-A3000 also has built-in dual subwoofers and three front speakers, giving it 3.1 channels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is where this new soundbar differs from the preceding HT-A5000, which is a 5.1.2 channel soundbar
            </p>

                About Us Advertise BEIJING, Sept 1 — Around 16 million people in the Chinese city of Chengdu will be effectively under lockdown from Thursday as authorities race to snuff out a new Covid-19 outbreak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China is the last major economy wedded to a zero-Covid policy, stamping out virus flare-ups with snap shutdowns, mass testing and lengthy quarantines

            <p>
                Chengdu, in the southwest, has become the latest to announce a shutdown, saying in an official notice that residents must “stay home in principle” from 6pm on Thursday to combat a new wave of infections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said that all residents would be tested for the virus between Thursday and Sunday, and urged them not to leave the city unless “absolutely necessary”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chengdu recorded 157 new local infections on Thursday, of which 51 displayed no symptoms, the city government said in a separate notice

            <p>
                Last month, travellers in the southern island province of Hainan protested after more than 80,000 tourists were stranded in a resort city because of a Covid-19 flare-up

                Sony is hosting an event today to unveil a new Xperia smartphone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Japanese brand hasn't explicitly revealed the name of the new smartphone, but it's likely the Sony Xperia 5 IV

            <p>
                The Sony Xperia 5 IV is rumored to come with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC and sport a triple camera setup on the rear comprising three 12MP units (primary, telephoto, ultrawide)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Xperia 5 IV is expected to feature a 6.1" screen protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and pack a battery bigger than the Xperia 5 III's 4,500 mAh cell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We'll know all about the Sony Xperia 5 IV once the event concludes, so check our homepage for more on the new smartphone

                Keeping this in mind, it is not unreasonable for Apple to price the iPhone 14 between $699-$749.  Similarly, the iPhone 14 Max, is likely to be priced between $799-$849

                OBS Studio 28.0 gets a visual refresh, and gears up for modern use-cases with new tech support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As OBS Studio becomes ever more popular, it was time to support more modern use cases
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking of colors, OBS Studio 28.0 also introduces 10-bit color support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We’ve already seen native ARM support for other platforms, (notably Linux and the Raspberry Pi), and it is great to see this support extend to Apple’s ARM platform
            </p>
            
            <p>
                OBS Studio 28.0 finally brings Qt6 support, which has a huge number of benefits for all platforms
            </p>

                OBS Studio 28.0 gets a visual refresh, and gears up for modern use-cases with new tech support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As OBS Studio becomes ever more popular, it was time to support more modern use cases
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking of colors, OBS Studio 28.0 also introduces 10-bit color support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We’ve already seen native ARM support for other platforms, (notably Linux and the Raspberry Pi), and it is great to see this support extend to Apple’s ARM platform
            </p>
            
            <p>
                OBS Studio 28.0 finally brings Qt6 support, which has a huge number of benefits for all platforms

                It is not in the public interest if the prosecution were to practice discrimination

            <p>
                Hisyam said Muhyiddin, who is described as being similarly circumstanced as Ahmad Zahid, was not charged in court despite both men having held the home ministry portfolio and received monies in the form of political donations from UKSB's representatives
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reading out names of those implicated, Hisyam said evidence in court has clearly adduced politicians namely Khairy Jamaluddin, Datuk Seri Anifah Aman, Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein, Datuk Seri Reezal Merican Naina Merican, Shahril Hamdan, Tan Sri Ong Ka Chuan, Tan Sri Chan Kong Choy, Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal Muhyiddin and Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad were cash recipients of UKSB as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If they are unable to answer, it becomes the point of our submission that is selective prosecution," Hisyam said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid was charged with another seven counts as home minister who obtained S$1.15 million, RM3 million, CHF15,000 and US$15,000 in cash from the same company for himself in connection with his official work

                While Malaysian men have the automatic right to confer citizenship to their children born abroad through the simple process of registration under Article 14(1)(b) of the Federal Constitution, Malaysian women who give birth abroad must apply for Malaysian citizenship under Article 15(2) of the Federal Constitution

                While Malaysian men have the automatic right to confer citizenship to their children born abroad through the simple process of registration under Article 14(1)(b) of the Federal Constitution, Malaysian women who give birth abroad must apply for Malaysian citizenship under Article 15(2) of the Federal Constitution

                The first major upgrade on the new X1 Fold is a bigger 16.3-inch OLED display from Sharp

            <p>
                Rafizi was responding to questions on his reaction to being called up by the police to give his statement following his accusation linking Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Special Functions) Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad to alleged financial misconduct in relation to the RM9 billion LCS procurement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had earlier asked the police to launch an investigation into the scandal but was met with a counter-complaint filed by an aide of Dr Abdul Latiff, who is also the Mersing MP, yesterday for alleged defamation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi then expressed his concern that this could mean the police might not record Dr Abdul Latiff’s statement or even investigate him in relation to his earlier police report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that if that were to happen, it might give the public the perception that this was because the police are under the Home Ministry whose minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin is in the same party Dr Abdul Latiff
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said action should be taken as even Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan and PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang had their statements recorded by police recently

                Despite the move being long overdue, only certain Android phones [PDF] from brands such as HONOR, Huawei, Xiaomi, Nokia, Samsung, and Vivo currently support the telco’s new feature
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Celcom sub-brand had enabled Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) just earlier this year for both Android and iOS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For VoWiFi though, Yoodo decided to roll out the feature for Android users first, saying that support for iPhones will be coming later on but the company did not give a timeline for when this might happen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To enable VoWiFi on a supported phone, you need to go into the settings, tap on the Mobile Network, go into the Mobile Data section, and there should be a Wi-Fi Calling or VoWiFi option there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its parent company, Celcom, similarly took a while to roll out VoWiFi to its users, enabling the feature in June earlier this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even though it is one of the country’s major telcos, Celcom also had a gap between implementing VoWiFi for Android and iOS, with iPhone support coming in almost two months after the feature’s initial debut on its network
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unfortunately, Yoodo says that the feature currently cannot be used while roaming

                For just $30 more, the new Kobo Clara 2E brings better screen lighting that’s easier on the eyes, plus two important upgrades that should put a dent in the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 5's dominance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Feature for feature, it’s now well behind the Kindle Paperwhite 5 that Amazon released last October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the new Clara 2E, Kobo is finally playing catchup, and more or less matching the Kindle Paperwhite 5's best features, especially now that Amazon has restricted ebook downloads to a wifi connection only
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other major upgrade for the Kobo Clara 2E is the addition of Bluetooth, allowing wireless headphones, a wireless speaker, or a wireless connection to a car’s stereo to be used for enjoying audiobook content, which can be downloaded right to the e-reader itself from Kobo’s online store
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kobo also points out that the new Clara 2E’s housing is made from more than 85 percent recycled plastic; 10% of which is (was?) ocean-bound plastic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kobo Clara 2E is available for pre-order now for $130, with official availability starting on September 22

            <p>
                Lenovo on Thursday introduced a pair of midrange Android tablets that it hopes will steal market share from Apple's popular iPad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tablet runs Android 12, and Lenovo promises updates through Android 14
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lenovo doesn't say how much battery life to expect from the 7,700mAh cell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This slate ships with Android 12L, the tablet-specific version of Android 12, and should eventually get an upgrade to Android 14
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In November 2021, the iPad held about 59% of the market to Android's 41%

                With all this in mind, we want to know, what is your favorite solution for the potential notch replacement on the iPhone 14 Pro?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is how the company “invented” the notch, which is a cutout at the top of the screen where all these sensors, plus a microphone and speaker, are placed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, the company relocated the top speaker of the iPhone 13 to make the notch smaller, but it’s still there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This new report claims that Apple will make the two separate cutouts on the iPhone 14 Pro’s screen look like a single cutout
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regular iPhone 14 models are expected to keep the same notch as the iPhone 13

            <p>
                However, The Athletic reported yesterday that United had decided not to move for Dest, electing to keep Aaron Wan-Bissaka as back-up right-back instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He says a loan deal with an option to buy is agreed, and Dest is now set to fly to Milan to seal the move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dest will sign until June 2027, one year loan plus potential four year deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s unclear whether United decided not to sign Dest simply because they did not want to, or because there was no buyer for Aaron Wan-Bissaka
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even sending Wan-Bissaka on loan and then landing Dest on loan would have felt fairly pointless

            <p>
                Hence, the apprehension about Umno appointing "an AG of our own." Azalina, the way your Umno cohorts were blaming Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaacob for being a “cruel leader” is testament to the fact that they expected the PM to intervene in the judiciary process to free Najib and drop charges against Zahid

            <p>
                Her attempts to school Fann and defend her call to appoint an Umno-friendly AG are quite masterful

            <p>

                Azalina's way, at the minimum, feels like starting off on the wrong foot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, the apprehension about Umno appointing "an AG of our own." Azalina, the way your Umno cohorts were blaming Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaacob for being a “cruel leader” is testament to the fact that they expected the PM to intervene in the judiciary process to free Najib and drop charges against Zahid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, her speech last Saturday left me aghast
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Her attempts to school Fann and defend her call to appoint an Umno-friendly AG are quite masterful
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In fact, I would say she is deliberately evasive and circumlocutory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it’s just not good enough, Azalina

                Jurgen Klopp’s injury woes are finally starting to ease after a challenging start to the season for Liverpool, with a number of players returning to training this week Liverpool experienced a horrendous start to the new season and saw 10 players injured following their first three games of the campaign, but things are finally starting to look up for Jurgen Klopp’s men

                Liverpool forward Jota has been sidelined with a thigh injury that he picked up during the pre-season camp in Thailand in July, meaning he has failed to feature for the Reds since the end of last season, but he also made his return to first-team training on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 23-year-old picked up the injury following the 1-1 draw with Ukraine on June 14, before feeling the same problem again once he returned to Liverpool’s training base for pre-season
            </p>

                Centre-back Matip made his return to first-team training on Monday after being ruled out of action with a groin injury since the opening game of the season

                Liverpool youngster Jones has been out of action since his small cameo in the Community Shield victory over Manchester City on July 30, with the midfielder picking up a calf injury, but is now also on for his return to the squad for Saturday’s Merseyside derby

            <p>
                Ask after the game again but no chance for this game." Liverpool forward Jota has been sidelined with a thigh injury that he picked up during the pre-season camp in Thailand in July, meaning he has failed to feature for the Reds since the end of last season, but he also made his return to first-team training on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 23-year-old picked up the injury following the 1-1 draw with Ukraine on June 14, before feeling the same problem again once he returned to Liverpool’s training base for pre-season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A return to the squad could be expected soon as he has begun individual training

                Elden Ring wasn’t just a hit with fans of FromSoftware’s notoriously difficult action-RPGs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today’s announcement from FromSoft’s parent company Kadokawa revealed that Sony and Tencent are acquiring 14.09% and 16.25% of FromSoft, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement indicates that Kadokawa wants FromSoftware to be able to expand its development efforts; Kadokawa sees the “enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment of [FromSoft] game IP as one of the [Kadokawa] Group’s highest priorities.” One of the aims is to give FromSoft the resources needed to grow Elden Ring into a franchise that extends beyond just video games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elden Ring was a long time coming, built on a foundation first laid down in FromSoftware’s pioneering 2009 PS3 game Demon’s Souls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It owns 5% of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry publisher Ubisoft, completed an acquisition of League of Legends’ developer Riot Games, owns 40% of Epic Games, and has stakes in many, many, many, many other game companies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sony has also been on a spending spree too, though it looks a bit more modest compared to Tencent

                Also, seeing as Google appears to be much further into its development process, the company is now calling the new page a "welcome screen" for ChromeOS

            <p>
                However, as 9to5 notes, Google apparently isn't sure just yet how to bring back the welcome screen after you've clicked out of it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While we're still most likely a ways away from seeing this new welcome screen, 9to5 states there should be a new flag coming to the Chromium Gerrit that will allow eager testers to try out the new change before it releases
