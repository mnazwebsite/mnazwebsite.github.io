                The age of eligibility for the licence would be lowered from 21 years to 18 when the new rules come into force, to allow more people to become delivery riders, transport minister Wee Ka Siong said today
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said delivery riders with the goods licence would be given driving courses “because there are complaints that they do not abide by traffic laws”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wee said the requirement of a goods licence would allow the authorities to keep track of their number, and “know who are those working in the p-hailing service and their behaviour”, Bernama reported
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wee said the requirement for a goods licence was not meant to burden delivery riders but to enable the transport ministry to keep track of their numbers

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Friday, a group of about 200 delivery riders carried out a protest ride to the service company offices

                Posters with the words “Off 1 Hari” and “Food Delivery Blackout” had been widely shared on social media, calling for a boycott of the delivery service

                The LCS project calls for the construction of six corvette-class vessels for delivery between 2019 and this month
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein later said those involved in misconduct in the project would be brought to justice

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier today, PKR deputy president Rafizi Ramli had called out former prime minister Najib Razak, saying he could not wash his hands of the LCS deal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Najib was in office when the government signed the deal with Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) in 2011 and was the only person with the power to influence a change in the ship’s design from the navy’s original requirements
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A parliamentary committee said the navy and the defence ministry had agreed on a Dutch-design but the decision was changed to the French-designed Gowind ships after a recommendation by BNS to the defence minister
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The committee said the government had ignored the navy’s views as well as protest letters from the then chief of navy

                Khairul said investigations had shown that a group from India allegedly treated poorly at the terminal had not gone to the immigration counter directly and had been loitering in the arrival area for almost three hours
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the immigration officers went looking for them after officers noted that some passengers listed on the airline manifest had not turned up at the immigration counter even after two to three hours
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “They were taken to the operation room for investigation,” he told reporters after an engagement session between the department and tourism agencies at KLIA here today

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In another development, Khairul said the National Integrated Immigration System was expected to be operational in early 2024, to replace the Malaysian Immigration System which had been in operation for more than 20 years
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The new system, incorporating fingerprint and facial biometric recognition, would contribute to effective enforcement

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On another matter, Khairul said his department will give its full cooperation to the investigation committee probing the incident involving a senior government official and an immigration officer at KLIA on Aug 3

                Loke said Wee’s decision demonstrated that an open tender for the project was not feasible despite the latter’s insistence on calling for a fresh tender in August 2020

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After the PH government collapsed in 2020 and was replaced by Perikatan Nasional, Wee took over as the transport minister and said the project would be reopened for tender, before mocking Loke for not choosing this “cheaper” option

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During case management last month, the Federal Court dismissed Najib's new defence counsel's application to adjourn the hearing of the appeal, which was fixed for Aug 15 to 26
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As a result, the hearing of Najib's application to adduce further evidence with regard to then High Court trial judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali has been fixed to be heard first on Aug 15, followed by the hearing of the former premier's appeal to set aside his conviction and sentence

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib said he hopes that the appointment of the new defence team will bring a fresh or different perspective to the case as he is headed for the final appeal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction and sentence in Najib's appeal, and in a strongly-worded judgement described how SRC, which started off as a national interest venture, had in the end become a national embarrassment

                The matter in question in the suit is an allegation by Muhyiddin that Ahmad Zahid sought his help to intervene in certain court cases

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Justice Rozana Ali Yusoff said this in her dismissal of Ahmad Zahid's injunction application against Muhyiddin during an online proceeding here on Monday (Aug 8)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court dismissed the application with RM5,000 in costs

                In today's proceedings, the court heard the plaintiff's (Ahmad Zahid) application for an interim injunction against the defendant

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Bagan Datuk MP claimed that Muhyiddin’s statement implied that he had used a shortcut to settle and postpone his ongoing court cases, that he had asked for Muhyiddin’s help to intervene in the court cases and the judiciary system, to order the dissolution of the Johor State Assembly and also implied that he was not a respectable and exemplary leader

                Muhyiddin claimed that when he heard the plaintiff’s request, he told the latter that he could not and would not interfere with the court proceedings and advised the plaintiff to defend himself in court if he was truly innocent

                He pointed out that Ismail had yet to make any comment or initiate any action after the PAC released its report on the controversial LCS project last week

                “If such a high-level committee can be formed over the alleged verbal abuse incident at KLIA, why is a similar high-level committee not formed to act against those responsible for the RM9 billion LCS scandal?” the Bagan MP said in a statement

                “DAP has no objection if the government deems such a high-level committee as necessary to probe an alleged verbal abuse incident, but similar attention and importance should be placed on the LCS scandal when RM6 billion has been paid without a single ship delivered

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, PAC chairman Wong Kah Woh said the defence ministry and Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) had ignored the navy’s views on the LCS project over the design of the LCS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong also said not a single ship had been completed although Putrajaya had spent RM6 billion on the project, which was given to BNS via direct negotiations

                Lim said the police’s denial of the allegations were unconvincing and called for a current or former judge to lead the public inquiry into the claims made by Meta, the technology company behind Facebook and Instagram

                On Friday, Meta said more than 800 Facebook and Instagram accounts, pages and groups were in the “troll farm” network, and had posted memes in support of the current ruling coalition, accused its critics of corruption, criticised the opposition, and also praised the police

                should not turn a blind eye to what can be an epidemic of short-sightedness among the young

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Research published this year found that eight out of every 10 pupils tested at a rural Chinese primary school in Bentong suffered from vision problems, with about 60% of them being myopic (short-sighted) and 16% hyperopic (far-sighted)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This situation can cause fatigue to the visual system – previous studies showed that excessive near-vision tasks can accelerate the progression of myopia,” the scientists said in their report

                China's military planners have long discussed a blockade of Taiwan, but until now most likely saw practicing such a move as too provocative, security experts say

                But after US House Speaker Pelosi's visit, China's military for the first time fired missiles over Taipei, flew waves of drones over Taiwan's offshore islands, sailed warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and surrounded the self-ruled island in what Taiwan's military said amounted to a practice "blockade"

                The show of capability and resolve comes from a People's Liberation Army (PLA) that is far more formidable than it was during the "Third Taiwan Strait Crisis" in 1996, the last time it fired missiles near Taiwan

                Many of these highly regarded convent schools were built over 100 years ago, with the first IJS school as well as orphanage set up in Light Street, George Town, in 1852

                In a rare interview, Sister Mary Theresa Chua, the Provincial of the IJS – which is legally known as the Lady Superior of the Society of Saint Maur – says the estimated RM3mil annual grants from the Education Ministry (MOE) for all 56 schools would only be enough for basic maintenance, working out to around “RM50,000 to RM70,000 for each school’’

                The site borders the Kuala Lumpur Forest Eco Park, and Sister Theresa fears that the ongoing wet spell and the year-end rainy season would be a problem

                In 2020, a landslip also hit the school, which was established in 1899, after heavy rain caused a near collapse of a retaining wall

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, Aug 7 — Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg today stressed that the state government will protect non-Muslims and care for them to achieve togetherness and inclusion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said as an example the Sarawak government has channeled aid to non-Muslims through the Unit for Other Religions (UNIFOR) on the basis that non-Muslims also need the protection and care of the state government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the state government has also provided an allocation of RM70 million to build UNIFOR Building in Jalan Ong Tiang Swee, Kuching, so that its administration is more organised and the implementation of religious activities under UNIFOR is more orderly
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I am confident and believe that togetherness in terms of religious development between the Muslim and non-Muslim communities in Sarawak will give birth to a society that is friendly to each other and avoids prejudices that can cause division,” the premier said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said as the head of the state government who is a Muslim, he has always insisted that the “Charter of Medina” is a very suitable guide to guarantee fair administration for the multi-ethnic and multi-religious communities in Sarawak

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a statement today, Shahrizat said that the Court of Appeal's decision reinforcing that Malaysian women cannot confer citizenship is devastating for Malaysian women
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In this case, the Malaysian government had appealed against the High Court's September 9, 2021 decision, which recognised that Malaysia’s citizenship laws discriminated against women and which had ruled that Malaysian mothers whose children are born overseas should also be entitled to Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While waiting for the Court of Appeal to decide on the appeal, the six Malaysian mothers who filed the suit managed to obtain citizenship documents from the National Registration Department (NRD) for their overseas-born children
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This was because the High Court and Court of Appeal refused to allow the government to defer issuing the citizenship papers while waiting for the appeal to be decided
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After the decision on Friday, lawyer for the six Malaysian mothers, Datuk Gurdial Singh Nijar informed the Court of Appeal that his clients would be appealing to the Federal Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Court of Appeal however, ruled that status quo should be maintained for the overseas-born children of the six Malaysian mothers who had obtained the Malaysian citizenship papers, until the Federal Court decides on their appeal
