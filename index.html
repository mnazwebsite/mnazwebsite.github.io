                Ayadali noted that there was no specific law in Malaysia to deal with cyberbullying despite a lot of talk about it for many years

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said it remained a huge challenge to eradicate cyberbullying, considering the many forms of online social interactions

                “The government should put more effort into combating cyberbullying as Malaysia is slowly climbing the ranks of being one of the top nations when it comes to cyberbullying,” he said

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 11— Bandar Kuching MP Dr Kelvin Yii has questioned an August 9 circular by a government hospital, banning online food delivery services into its premises, branding the decision "illogical and unfair"
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Taking to Twitter, Dr Yii urged the Ministry of Health (MoH) to look into the matter, saying that such decisions should not be made at the convenience and expense of the hospital's employees
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Even if you want to help the cafeteria, not at the expense of the choice & convenience for the health workers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                not a private business at the hospital," he added

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The hospital said that it had also reminded the cafeteria in the building to improve its service and food preparations for its workers and members of the public from time to time, based on need

                Air Selangor said the accident occurred on Km75.9 of the Karak-Bentong highway, with chemical pollution in the river forcing it to halt operations of its Langat 2 water treatment plant at 4.30am

                Former minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Redzuan Yusof said this could be done by eliminating the “senior” rank of certain ministers and reducing the number of deputy ministers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was asked to comment on the debate among various parties on Bersatu pressing Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob to keep his pledge of offering the party the deputy prime minister’s post in exchange for its support to him for the premiership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This would have given an impression that the new prime minister is being frugal and has initiated impactful changes with reduced expenditure
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Having senior ministers with perks has been seen by the public as not being aligned to what the rakyat wants.” On speculation that a Bersatu survey among its Supreme Council members had chosen its secretary-general Hamzah Zainudin over vice-president Azmin Ali to be nominated as the deputy prime minister, Redzuan said he was not aware of this
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At the Dewan Negara on Tuesday, it was a Bersatu minister, Abdul Latiff Ahmad, who downplayed the need for a deputy prime minister, saying Putrajaya believed the current Cabinet line-up was adequate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Latiff also stressed that the appointment of ministers and their deputies was the prerogative of the prime minister

                Ahmad claimed that DAP had finally realised that Umno had the strongest grassroots support compared to other parties
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Pontian MP said Umno’s 22,000 branches made it difficult for its rivals to topple the party regardless of whether there was a “political tsunami”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ahmad said this in response to his DAP counterpart, Loke Siew Fook, stating that DAP and Umno could join forces after the 15th general election due to the absence of a single, dominant party
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Aug 7, FMT reported Loke as “implying” that any cooperation between DAP and Umno might happen after GE15 since Malaysian politics had experienced drastic changes post-GE14 with the absence of a single, dominant party
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                DAP was open to working with any party pursuing these same agendas, he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Recently, DAP and its Pakatan Harapan (PH) partners, PKR and Amanah, have cooperated with Umno and its leaders on matters such as the ousting of Bersatu’s Ahmad Faizal Azumu as Perak menteri besar, and signing the memorandum of understanding between PH and Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob

                It may be that some members of the team may be reluctant to proceed without being allowed adequate time to prepare, he said

                On the two reports, Ismail Sabri said the Cabinet had agreed that the governance, procurement and finance investigation committee’s report on the LCS would be made public

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the Cabinet also proposed that the forensic audit report on LCS that was conducted in 2019 be declassified

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                PAC chairman Wong Kah Woh said the key report related to the LCS scandal must be fully declassified, unlike what was done with the report for another project where important information was redacted

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong Chin Huat of Sunway University said Azalina’s proposal for a recall election mechanism would be the best way of plugging loopholes such as one that leaves a party at a disadvantage if it were to sack a member who is an MP
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under the bill passed by the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara, MPs sacked by their parties would retain their seats, which means a party would lose out for taking action against an MP
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under Azalina’s proposal, a by-election could be triggered if 40% of the voters in a constituency signed a recall petition, if an MP were to be sacked by his or her party or if a party were to quit a coalition
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The power to punish party-hoppers would then be with the voters,” Wong told FMT
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This is something DAP plans to do by amending its constitution so that elected representatives who do not toe the party line on fundamental issues will automatically lose their membership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But he said the danger of this “roundabout remedy” is that the party constitution might become so constraining that MPs might lose their autonomy and become yes men

                Ahmad Kamarulzaman was responding to allegations on social media that the launch of KD Maharajalela (referred to as LCS 1) was just for show and that the actual ship was not at the event

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ahmad Kamarulzaman said the tradition was also practised in other parts of the world, adding that the same was done for the LCS built by France’s Naval Group for the United Arab Emirates

                According to Malaysiakini, Bernama chief executive officer Roslan Ariffin said he would prefer to have a discussion with Sydney Yap
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier today, Yap said the Mandarin news segment was seeing less airtime due to a lack of staff, which she claimed was caused by low wages and bureaucracy in hiring new employees
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She also claimed the team had dwindled to just three people from eight previously

                This led to Bernama threatening a lawsuit against her, a move which drew criticism

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Emilia’s counsel Nizam Bashir Abdul Kariem Bashir argued that Article 126 of the Federal Constitution indicated that the power to initiate committal proceedings lies within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, Court of Appeal and the High Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nizam said the Kuala Lumpur shariah court could not hear the committal proceedings against his client because she is no longer a resident of the Federal Territory and now lives in Kajang, Selangor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also rejected Emilia’s application to suspend the ongoing committal proceedings in the shariah high court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Other respondents are the Registrar of the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court, the Chief Registrar of the Federal Territories shariah court of appeal, the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court, the Kuala Lumpur shariah court of appeal and the government of Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Based on the judicial review application, Emilia said she did not live or reside in the Federal Territory during the “hadhanah” (custody) proceedings filed at the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court on July 23, 2018
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Emilia sought a declaration that the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court and shariah court of appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear and punish any individual who contravenes the court, as it is the exclusive rights of the civil courts, according to Article 126 of the Federal Constitution

                The Pakatan Harapan government did not ‘freeze’ the LCS project,” they said

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Out of the RM6.08 billion which the Malaysian government had already paid to Boustead Naval Shipyard under the RM9.128 billion LCS project, Mohamad and Liew claimed that a total of RM745 million was used to “bail out” the older project involving the supply of New Generation Patrol Vessels (NGPV)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The two pressed Hishammuddin to say if he agreed that the LCS project funds could be used to pay off the debts in the NGPV project, while also asking if the LCS project was started with the intentions of “rolling” the old debts in the NGPV project
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Noting that Hishammuddin had on April 20 announced that the LCS project would be continued, the two pointed out that no one, including the PAC, had been given details about how funds would be obtained for and the timeline for the LCS project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mohamad and Liew urged Hishammuddin to explain the financial status of Boustead Naval Shipyard and the LCS project to the Dewan Negara

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to the witness, he used his son’s company to issue the invoices because he did not own a company

                Syed Mohsin said that in October 2013, Shahrir had asked him to find a contractor for the project, which is now known as Sri Anugerah, because the politician knew that he had many friends who worked as contractors

                Tan Sri Shahrir and I visited the project site and we discussed the payment for the rehabilitation work and when it could begin,” said Syed Mohsin, who said he had known Shahrir for over 30 years

                Third Warrant Officer Jeffrey Heng suffered some injuries when he landed during the National Day Parade

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                3WO Heng, the last of 10 parachutists to land, was stretchered off after his rough landing on Tuesday that saw him tumble to the ground

                We wish a speedy recovery to 3WO Jeffrey!" 3WO Heng had attempted to land at a safe distance away from his teammates, while fighting against strong crosswinds, said retired commando Chan Seck Sung, who was in the audience at the Marina Bay floating platform and witnessed 3WO Heng’s hard landing

                “It is also best to land on grass because it is softer.” Chan added that parachutists are trained to break their fall by rolling on the ground

                — 123rf.com The number of Malaysian youths involved in sexual intercourse has doubled since 2016, according to a recent survey

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to the Sexual Health and Intimate Wellness Survey 2022, which spoke to over 1,000 Malaysians aged between 18 and 30, 35.4% of them had had sexual intercourse, compared to 18.8% from the first survey in 2016

                Fellow Suhakam commissioner Ragunath Kesavan said the appointments of lawyers Hasnal Rezua Merican Habib Merican and Nazira Abdul Rahim did not go against any provisions in the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act 1999

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was reported that Hasnal is the Selayang Umno deputy chief while Nazira is the head of the women’s wing of Kulim Umno

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ragunath, a former Bar Council president, said there was no provision in the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act that prohibited individuals with political ties from becoming a Suhakam commissioner

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Suaram said any legal action against newsreader Sydney Yap would threaten press freedom in Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “We urge Bernama to focus on addressing the issues that have been raised by her,” Suaram executive director Sevan Doraisamy said, referring to Yap’s claims of pay cuts and less airtime for the agency’s Mandarin unit
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, FMT reported that Bernama would be suing Yap for alleged defamation over the newsreader’s claims
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysiakini quoted Bernama as saying Yap’s comments, which were published in a Facebook post, had tarnished the image of the state-owned agency and even the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Bernama said the manpower shortage was an industry-wide issue for Mandarin broadcasters
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) also condemned Bernama for threatening to sue Yap, describing such action as “unnecessary”

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Taiwan rejects China’s sovereignty claims, says the island’s people should decide its future and vows to defend its democracy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China had said in two previous white papers on Taiwan, in 1993 and 2000, that it “will not send troops or administrative personnel to be based in Taiwan” after achieving unification
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                That line, meant to assure Taiwan it would enjoy autonomy after becoming a special administrative region of China, did not appear in the latest white paper
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s ruling Communist Party had proposed that Taiwan could return to its rule under a “one country, two systems” model, similar to the formula under which the former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A line in the 2000 white paper that said “anything can be negotiated” as long as Taiwan accepts that there is only one China and does not seek independence, is also missing from the latest white paper
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The updated white paper is called “The Taiwan Question and China’s Reunification in the New Era”

                Sources familiar with the investigation had claimed that the MBI Group founder was supposed to be repatriated to Malaysia for investigation on Tuesday (Aug 9)

                It is learnt that China was the first country to ask for Teow to be extradited there

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Police then started hunting for Teow and his two fugitive sons

                It was reported earlier that Teow would be taken to Johor for investigation, but it was later said he would be brought to China for trial

                THE Federal Territories Ministry has removed Gobi Krishnan as a member of the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) excise licensing board
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Federal Territories Minister Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim in a statement said following a check with the Insolvency Department on Aug 3, the ministry confirmed that Gobi had been declared a bankrupt
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Following a search with the department, it has been confirmed that Gobi Krishnan was declared a bankrupt effective Jan 7, 2021

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Shahidan added that the law does not say that a bankrupt can not become a member of the excise board, nor does it say that the position will be vacated automatically if a member is to become a bankrupt

                Tourists visit a scenic area on Pingtan island, one of mainland China's closest point from Taiwan, in Fujian province on Aug 5, 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On its own, such a display would normally generate widespread condemnation of China

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia’s special envoy to China condemned Pelosi for "fanning the fires of antagonism” in a statement backing Beijing, although the country’s foreign minister later said it wasn’t official government policy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Pelosi herself said the visit was meant to show US support for the island democracy, insisting that China "cannot prevent world leaders or anyone from traveling to Taiwan.” In a sign of how both the US and China sought to shape the narrative over the visit, both sides cited Asean’s statement as affirmation of their position

                The High Court here has given her a full acquittal instead of the discharge not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA) granted last year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a Facebook post, Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi said the state government has presented its findings regarding the coordination of weekend rest days for His Majesty the Sultan of Johor’s consideration
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was first reported on June 14 that the Johor government is reviewing the current Friday and Saturday weekend rest days in the state following complaints by the public
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Following that, Malay Mail reported on June 20 that the state government may implement an official two-and-a-half-day weekend, with Friday as a half-day, followed by Saturday and Sunday as weekend rest days
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In late 2013, Sultan Ibrahim decreed the change of the state’s weekend rest days to Friday and Saturday from Saturday and Sunday
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Since January 1, 2014, Johor has been observed Friday and Saturday as its official weekend rest days

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In Malaysia, Kedah, Kelantan, and Terengganu also observe Friday and Saturday as official weekend rest days.

                Immigration Services Union of Peninsular Malaysia, a union for immigration department staff, had previously demanded that Shafiq issue a public apology over the incident

                He also asked transport minister Wee Ka Siong to explain why the punishment for drunk drivers who caused deaths was double the punishment for Mat Rempit who caused deaths

                Lim also criticised the ministry’s proposal for insurers to charge motorcyclists arrested for illegal racing higher premiums, saying this would likely be ineffective as many Mat Rempit were not even insured

                After deliberation with his attorneys on Tuesday morning (Aug 9), Fong Soong Hert, 51, admitted to killing Pek Ying Ling, his wife of 28 years, last year

                After the jury was led in, the judge opened the day's session by informing them of the change in plea, while Fong showed no emotion

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairuddin Aman Razali said Malay-Muslim voters should either support PAS or Umno in the coming 15th general election to avoid any further split between the two largest Malay-based parties
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In May, Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had even said MN was “as good as dead”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “So, there is no need to conclude that MN is buried, as no Umno or PAS leader has come out to declare it so
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairuddin said that even though he wanted PAS and Umno to continue working together under MN, it did not mean Bersatu should be left out of the pact
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “We understand that Umno does not want anything to do with Bersatu,” the former PAS central committee member said, referring to Umno’s decision to cut ties with Muhyiddin’s party
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “In my opinion, it would be a loss (for PAS) to leave Umno and work with Bersatu, but that is the president’s and the party’s right (on who they choose to work with).” He said although Hadi’s strategy had backfired by choosing PN over Umno in the Johor and Melaka elections, he did not discount the possibility that teaming up with Umno as well would have reaped benefits at that time

                KYIV (Reuters) -     Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of exploiting its position in a nuclear power plant it had seized to target a nearby town in a rocket attack that killed at least 13 people and left many others seriously wounded
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The town Ukraine says Russia targeted - Marhanets - is one that Russia has alleged Ukrainian forces have used in the past to shell Russian forces who are holed up at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which they took over in March

                There was no immediate comment from Russia on the Ukrainian allegations of a rocket attack on Marhanets and Reuters could not independently verify the allegations

                CRIMEAN AIR BASE ATTACK The head of Ukraine's state nuclear power firm on Tuesday warned of the "very high" risk of shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and said it was vital Kyiv regained control of the facility in time for winter

                "The state’s insistence that being LGBT is unacceptable, its funding of conversion practices, and its failure to respond to harmful conversion practices by non-state actors, all harm LGBT people

                According to the report, Jakim in 2018 noted that 1,450 LGBT people had "recovered” from the "disease” through mukhayyam since the programme was initiated in 2012
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                By June 2021, the government reported that 1,733 LGBT people had attended these programmes
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The group also asked for more acceptance in the workplace, noting a Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam) report where 57 out of 100 people were denied employment at least once because of their gender identity
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Such experiences discouraged the revelation of gender identities for fear of discrimination, the HRW said in the report when noting the lack of access to legal gender recognition in Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                HRW also urged the government to repeal laws that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity

                “From the doctor’s medical examination, there are signs of a previous assault,” he said at a press conference after the Johor police shooting competition with the media, in conjunction with Police Day at the REM Farm shooting range in Kota Tinggi here today

                It is understood that the rape took place on July 31 at about 3am and a police report was lodged by the victim and her teacher

                On the suspected abuse of an autistic child at a therapy centre in Skudai in July, Kamarul said police had submitted the investigation papers to the deputy public prosecutor’s office

                Klang MP Charles Santiago said more than 200 straight-A Indian students were denied entrance into the pre-university matriculation system while Bumiputera admissions were at 90%

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “It’s important to remember that many of these children come from the B40 low-income group, where education is the only way out
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But instead, they are kept trapped by an apartheid system,” he said in a statement

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Instead of making university admissions accessible based on merit, the government chooses to play the race card.” Santiago said this disparity denied students access to higher education despite obtaining good grades

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said education minister Radzi Jidin’s recent acknowledgement of the education system’s stagnation, due to an unwillingness to change, came as no surprise

                “Recently I observed very intense discussions regarding the Bon Odori festival in Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Previously, the festival made headlines when religious affairs minister Idris Ahmad reminded Muslims not to take part in the Japanese community’s annual summer festival, claiming that the celebration was “influenced by elements of other religions”
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Idris’ statement prompted the Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, to instruct the Selangor Islamic religious department (Jais) to allow the festival to proceed

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Of the eight appeals, five involved Pacific & Orient Insurance Co Bhd, Amgeneral Insurance Bhd, Allianz General Insurance Company (M) Bhd, and Malaysian Motor Insurance Pool

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If a vehicle injured a victim, that person could sue the owner or the driver of the vehicle
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This was because if the vehicle owner had insurance coverage, the insurer (insurance company) would automatically step in and “indemnify” the victim, without the victim having to sue the insurer
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In one of the cases, the vehicle owner had “sold” the vehicle to a third party through what is known as “sambung bayar” (continuing payments), without informing the insurance company

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Using that order, the insurance companies refused to cover the victim’s loss
