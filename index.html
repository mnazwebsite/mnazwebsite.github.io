                This was after the prosecution came to learn of new information that the police had received in the case of David Ong
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Ong and his daughter’s age and occupation were not stated in court documents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TODAY has sought comment from the police on what action will be taken against Ong and his daughter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When a police officer arrived at the scene of the accident, Ong told the officer that he was the driver of the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ong was eventually arrested on Nov 24 in 2020 and charged on Sept 7 that year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ong did not dispute the chain of events
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DPP Santhra noted that during Ong’s mitigation plea at the time, he repeated that he was responsible for the accident, which was a result of his negligence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then, in April this year, the police were alerted to the audio recording between Ong and his daughter “that contained evidence suggesting that the (Ong) was not the driver of the car” when the accident happened, DPP Santhra wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both father and daughter later admitted to the police during investigation on May 27 this year that Ms Ong was the driver of the vehicle when the collision happened
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This information then came to the prosecution’s attention, DPP Santhra said, adding that Ong had lied to the police in 2019 “to shield Audrey Ong from prosecution”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Given that the evidence now shows that it was Audrey Ong and not (Ong) who was the driver of the car at the material time, the conviction of (Ong) in respect of the charge is palpably wrong,” DPP Santhra said, as she urged the court to revoke Ong’s conviction

                This frame grab from Royal Pool video footage made available via AFPTV on October 7, 2022 shows Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida meeting people at a hospital in Thailand's Nong Bua Lam Phu, where the monarch met survivors and relatives after a mass shooting by a former police officer at a nursery

            <p>
                Thailand's king has told the families of victims of a nursery massacre that left 36 people dead that he "shares their grief" in a rare public address following one of the country's worst ever mass killings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                King Maha Vajiralongkorn met survivors and relatives at a hospital in northeastern Nong Bua Lam Phu province late on Friday, a day after an ex-policeman murdered 24 children and 12 adults on a three-hour gun and knife rampage in a sleepy rural area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I come here to give you support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I share your sorrow, your grief," he said in video footage published online on Saturday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I support you all and wish you to be strong, so the spirits of the children can be at ease." The king, with Queen Suthida at his side, said he would pray for the dead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We have to do our best, the best that we can," he said

            </p>
            
            <p>
                King Maha Vajiralongkorn met survivors and relatives at a hospital in northeastern Nong Bua Lam Phu province late on Friday, a day after an ex-policeman murdered 24 children and 12 adults on a three-hour gun and knife rampage in a sleepy rural area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I come here to give you support
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I share your sorrow, your grief," he said in video footage published online on Saturday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I support you all and wish you to be strong, so the spirits of the children can be at ease." The king, with Queen Suthida at his side, said he would pray for the dead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We have to do our best, the best that we can," he said

                Relatives of the victims of a mass killing attack pray during a Buddhist ceremony at Wat Rat Samakee temple in the rural town of Uthai Sawan, north eastern Thailand, Saturday, Oct

            <p>

                Artour “Arteezy” Babaev is backing three teams to come out of The International 11 Last Chance qualifier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Evil Geniuses carry said that Xtreme Gaming, Virtus Pro, and Team Liquid were the favorites to make it into the main event

            <p>
                “They just weren’t able to play focused and threw a lot of games.” Instead, Royal Never Give Up, sporting three members of the TI8 and TI9 PSG.LGD team, was the one to qualify directly to TI11 through the qualifiers, after a 3-0 sweep against XG
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arteezy also called Virtus Pro a “stable” team, backing them to finish in the first two of the Last Chance Qualifiers

            <p>
                The team, which contested part of this season’s Dota Pro Circuit as Outsiders, was one point away from securing a direct invite to TI11

            <p>
                Losing to a revamped Team Secret in the Regional Qualifier meant they now have another hurdle to climb

                The TI10 grand finals in 2021 saw plucky underdogs Team Spirit take down the Chinese juggernauts, PSG.LGD

                Artour “Arteezy” Babaev is backing three teams to come out of The International 11 Last Chance qualifier
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Evil Geniuses carry said that Xtreme Gaming, Virtus Pro, and Team Liquid were the favorites to make it into the main event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They could have two of those three games that they lost, I thought
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “They just weren’t able to play focused and threw a lot of games.” Instead, Royal Never Give Up, sporting three members of the TI8 and TI9 PSG.LGD team, was the one to qualify directly to TI11 through the qualifiers, after a 3-0 sweep against XG
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arteezy also called Virtus Pro a “stable” team, backing them to finish in the first two of the Last Chance Qualifiers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team, which contested part of this season’s Dota Pro Circuit as Outsiders, was one point away from securing a direct invite to TI11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Losing to a revamped Team Secret in the Regional Qualifier meant they now have another hurdle to climb
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The TI10 grand finals in 2021 saw plucky underdogs Team Spirit take down the Chinese juggernauts, PSG.LGD
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One year later, the two teams retain the form that brought them to the top
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But I don’t have that feeling about Spirit or LGD

            <p>
                About Us Advertise NEW YORK, Oct 8 — The Biden administration yesterday published a sweeping set of export controls, including a measure to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with US equipment, vastly expanding its reach in its bid to slow Beijing’s technological and military advances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The raft of measures could amount to the biggest shift in US policy toward shipping technology to China since the 1990s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If effective, they could hobble China’s chip manufacturing industry by forcing American and foreign companies that use US technology to cut off support for some of China’s leading factories and chip designers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “China isn’t going to give up on chipmaking ..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                but this will really slow them (down).” In a briefing with reporters on Thursday previewing the rules, senior government officials said many of the measures were aimed at preventing foreign firms from selling advanced chips to China or supplying Chinese firms with tools to make their own advanced chips
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And we risk harming US technology leadership if foreign competitors are not subject to similar controls.” The expansion of US powers to control exports to China of chips made with US tools is based on a broadening of the so-called foreign direct product rule
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, the Biden administration applied the expanded restrictions to China’s IFLYTEK, Dahua Technology, and Megvii Technology, companies added to the entity list in 2019 over allegations they aided Beijing in the suppression of its Uyghur minority group
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The rules published yesterday also block shipments of a broad array of chips for use in Chinese supercomputing systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Eric Sayers, a defence policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said the move reflects a new bid by the Biden administration to contain China’s advances instead of simply seeking to level the playing field
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new regulations will also severely restrict export of US equipment to Chinese memory chip makers and formalise letters sent to Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) restricting shipments to China of chips used in supercomputing systems that nations around the world rely on to develop nuclear weapons and other military technologies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters was first to report key details of the new restrictions on memory chip makers, including a reprieve for foreign companies operating in China and the moves to broaden restrictions on shipments to China of technologies from KLA, Lam, Applied Materials, Nvidia and AMD

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 8 — Pro-growth measures in Budget 2023 would help cushion the Malaysian economy against an expected global recession, according to economists and a trade group who lauded the overall plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, they expressed misgivings over the government’s reluctance to widen its tax base, particularly by reintroducing the goods and services tax (GST) a previous rival administration had eliminated

            <p>
                UniKL Business School Assoc Prof Aimi Zulhazmi Abdul Rashid said the record RM372 billion allocations — RM40 billion more than Budget 2022 — demonstrated the government’s seriousness in ensuring the country’s economy would be in the best position possible next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This large Budget is needed to help the national economy fully recover, especially the SME (small and medium enterprises) sector, and to ensure that the domestic economy continues to be the (primary) engine next year when we are expected to face the global economic recession

            <p>
                Elaborating, Aimi said a tougher global economy next year meant domestic trade must be the growth engine for the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) and preserve jobs

                The same measure for micro-SMEs would also help protect their revenue stream during the same time, he said

            <p>
                “I would say that the tax cut, together with other programmes for SMEs such as grants and loan scheme, sends a signal which is the moment ‘to ride the tiger’ and this can create positive expectations which may be helpful in facing eventual economic difficulties,” Ferlito explained

                Fresh off helping Manchester City thrash their local rivals in the Premier League, tormentor-in-chief Kevin De Bruyne poked a fresh jab at Manchester United supporters  Kevin De Bruyne proved he’s a true blue by threatening to burn a Manchester United shirt in a hilarious clip
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Manchester City star has already been the reason for more than a few Old Trafford nightmares - and has now gone out of his way to deny a United dream
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fresh off the back of humiliating their neighbours last weekend, De Bruyne showed there was no sympathy for those on the red half of the city
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whilst making an appearance on Belgian podcast Mid Mid, the City ace was offered a United jersey with his name and number on the back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, while he was quick to dispose of that shirt, he has recently inherited a shirt from City’s rivals after successfully grabbing Cristiano Ronaldo ’s last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While he was pleased to get Ronaldo’s shirt, the smile was more likely down to the resounding nature of their win over the Red Devils
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We set up quite good," said De Bruyne
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We found the spaces in the first half and played a really good game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I feel like whenever we've played away at United we have played really well, and when we've been at home they've won more than we did
            </p>

                Fresh off helping Manchester City thrash their local rivals in the Premier League, tormentor-in-chief Kevin De Bruyne poked a fresh jab at Manchester United supporters  Kevin De Bruyne proved he’s a true blue by threatening to burn a Manchester United shirt in a hilarious clip
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Manchester City star has already been the reason for more than a few Old Trafford nightmares - and has now gone out of his way to deny a United dream
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fresh off the back of humiliating their neighbours last weekend, De Bruyne showed there was no sympathy for those on the red half of the city
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whilst making an appearance on Belgian podcast Mid Mid, the City ace was offered a United jersey with his name and number on the back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, while he was quick to dispose of that shirt, he has recently inherited a shirt from City’s rivals after successfully grabbing Cristiano Ronaldo ’s last week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While he was pleased to get Ronaldo’s shirt, the smile was more likely down to the resounding nature of their win over the Red Devils
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We set up quite good," said De Bruyne
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We found the spaces in the first half and played a really good game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I feel like whenever we've played away at United we have played really well, and when we've been at home they've won more than we did

                In an effort to counter rising prices at the pump, President Biden plans to plunder the country’s “oil piggy bank.” In November, the Department of Energy will deliver 10 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The SPR — the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil — was established back in 1975 in case of a severe oil supply crisis or economic disruption
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Biden’s decision comes after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) said it would slash oil production by 2 million barrels a day — putting extra pressure on the global energy supply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, even before OPEC+ declared it would be cutting back on oil production, gas prices began inching back up again in late September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group says the production cuts are being made due to “the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” As of Oct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The press release noted that 10 million barrels of oil would be drained from the SPR and the Secretary of Energy would be exploring other options to increase domestic production
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since March, the Energy Department has released 160 million barrels of crude oil, or over a quarter of the stockpile — draining the SPR to its lowest levels in four decades
            </p>

            <p>
                The group’s concern was that depleting the emergency reserve could put the U.S
            </p>

                at risk if the global or domestic oil supply reaches dangerously low levels before the supply can be brought back up

            <p>
                The IPAA recommends ramping up domestic natural gas and oil production instead, although oil producers are already dealing with supply-chain issues, limited capital and investor pressure to boost returns

                Liverpool face Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in the Premier League on Sunday with the club-record signing looking to reignite his season after a stop-start campaign so far in front of goal Jurgen Klopp has shrugged off the language barrier between him and Darwin Nunez, joking not being able to understand him helped Roberto Firmino
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez claims he does not know what Klopp is saying and the Liverpool boss admits the £85million Uruguay striker has very limited English
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp says this is not an issue because Liverpool have several Spanish speakers and quipped Firmino’s lack of English helped him when he first arrived at Anfield
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He’s a kid, but a confident person as well, but not a grown-up man already, we all know that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s clear, but it’s all fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The headline was he doesn’t understand a word I’m saying, I know that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I understand why you ask that, but I would say it’s all fine.”  Klopp feels Liverpool’s poor form has not helped Nunez, who banged in 32 goals for Benfica last season, and it is hard settling into a new team when they are struggling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We need to perform consistently to our level and beyond and then you need a striker to finish off all the things we create
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s why everybody should be optimistic about what’s coming from him in the future.”  HAVE YOUR SAY! Will Nunez be a success at Liverpool? Let us know in the comments section   Nunez’s struggles are in contrast to how well Gabriel Jesus has done at Arsenal since his £45million summer switch from Manchester City and the Brazil striker has scored five goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We need to make sure he stops flying for a weekend.” Klopp refused to say if he would stick with the 4-2-3-1 formation, which worked so well against Rangers, claiming his main target for his team is to be unpredictable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have to be more unpredictable, definitely.” Read more What do Liverpool need to clinch the title? Keep up with all the Reds news with our FREE daily newsletter

            <p>
                That’s clear, but it’s all fine

            <p>
                I understand why you ask that, but I would say it’s all fine.”  Klopp feels Liverpool’s poor form has not helped Nunez, who banged in 32 goals for Benfica last season, and it is hard settling into a new team when they are struggling
            </p>

                “We need to perform consistently to our level and beyond and then you need a striker to finish off all the things we create
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s why everybody should be optimistic about what’s coming from him in the future.”  HAVE YOUR SAY! Will Nunez be a success at Liverpool? Let us know in the comments section   Nunez’s struggles are in contrast to how well Gabriel Jesus has done at Arsenal since his £45million summer switch from Manchester City and the Brazil striker has scored five goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We need to make sure he stops flying for a weekend.” Klopp refused to say if he would stick with the 4-2-3-1 formation, which worked so well against Rangers, claiming his main target for his team is to be unpredictable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We have to be more unpredictable, definitely.” Read more What do Liverpool need to clinch the title? Keep up with all the Reds news with our FREE daily newsletter

                The Department of Education reversed course last week by quietly scaling back on eligibility for President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you owe $25K+ in student loans, there are ways to pay them off faster Too many Americans are still missing out on cheaper car insurance A TikToker paid off $17,000 in credit card debt by 'cash stuffing' — can it work for you? Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan made waves when it was first announced in August, with the promise that billions of dollars were about to be wiped from student loan records
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The department’s website originally stated that borrowers with privately held federal student loans, such as through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) and Perkins programs, could receive relief by consolidating these loans into the Direct Loan program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the guidance now specifies, that consolidation loans comprised of any FFEL or Perkins loans that aren’t held by the Education Department are only eligible for forgiveness if the borrower applied for consolidation before Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The FFEL program was shuttered in 2010, but an administration official told NPR about 800,000 borrowers would now be excluded from relief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the statement provided to NPR, that may mean FFEL borrowers could receive one-time debt relief without having to consolidate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They allege that Missouri's loan servicer is facing a “number of ongoing financial harms” by losing revenue from FFEL loans

            </p>
            
            <p>
                That being said, the Biden administration has indicated that borrowers can choose to opt out of the forgiveness plan if they wish

                The gross national debt in America has hit new heights, surpassing $31 trillion, according to a U.S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And with the dramatic rise in interest rates over the past few months — the Fed funds rate is currently between 3% and 3.35% — the national debt will be growing at a rate that makes it even harder to ignore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, more than $965 million is spent every day just in interest on the national debt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are different kinds of national debt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Think about it like having a credit card, a mortgage and a car payment — all debt, but different
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Department of the Treasury manages the national debt, which is split between what one government agency owes to another and debts that are held by the public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Intragovernmental debt accounts for about $6.5 trillion of the debt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The much bigger piece of the debt is held by the public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Right now, that’s about $24 trillion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Domestically, the Federal Reserve holds the largest share of the public debt, at about 40%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ultimately, rising interest rates will only exacerbate the national debt, making it harder for the government to respond to a slowing economy

            <p>
                The gross national debt in America has hit new heights, surpassing $31 trillion, according to a U.S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And with the dramatic rise in interest rates over the past few months — the Fed funds rate is currently between 3% and 3.35% — the national debt will be growing at a rate that makes it even harder to ignore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, more than $965 million is spent every day just in interest on the national debt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are different kinds of national debt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Think about it like having a credit card, a mortgage and a car payment — all debt, but different
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Department of the Treasury manages the national debt, which is split between what one government agency owes to another and debts that are held by the public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Intragovernmental debt accounts for about $6.5 trillion of the debt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The much bigger piece of the debt is held by the public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Right now, that’s about $24 trillion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Domestically, the Federal Reserve holds the largest share of the public debt, at about 40%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ultimately, rising interest rates will only exacerbate the national debt, making it harder for the government to respond to a slowing economy

                Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition saga may be exhausting, but it has revealed how some business leaders are thinking privately about return-to-office mandates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Calacanis said in an exchange with Musk in April that a return-to-office mandate at Twitter—a reversal from the company’s current remote-work policy—could lead to 20% of Twitter’s staff voluntarily quitting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And according to Calacanis, they’re using return-to-office mandates to do so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Calacanis was quick to reach out to Musk after the news of his $44 billion Twitter acquisition offer first broke
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Put me in the game coach! Twitter CEO is my dream job.” Calacanis went on to argue that Twitter could meet the standards of its Big Tech peers, at least in terms of revenue per employee, if it dramatically cut staff
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a “back of the envelope” calculation, he said Twitter’s revenue per employee was just $625,000 in 2021, compared to $1.9 million per employee for Google and $2.37 million per employee for Apple—but if Musk were to cut 5,000 of Twitter’s 8,000 workers, he could increase Twitter’s revenue per employee to a “more industry standard” $1.66 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Insane potential for improvement,” Musk responded after emphasizing Calacanis’s text
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then Calacanis proposed using a return-to-office mandate to get rid of some of Twitter’s staff without having to pay the typical exit packages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Twitter’s previous CEO, Jack Dorsey, implemented a “forever” remote-work policy in 2020 that allows Twitter employees to work wherever they are most productive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “2 day a week office requirement = 20% voluntary departures,” Calacanis wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Maybe we don't talk Twitter on Twitter,” Calacanis wrote

                “Put me in the game coach! Twitter CEO is my dream job.” Calacanis went on to argue that Twitter could meet the standards of its Big Tech peers, at least in terms of revenue per employee, if it dramatically cut staff
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a “back of the envelope” calculation, he said Twitter’s revenue per employee was just $625,000 in 2021, compared to $1.9 million per employee for Google and $2.37 million per employee for Apple—but if Musk were to cut 5,000 of Twitter’s 8,000 workers, he could increase Twitter’s revenue per employee to a “more industry standard” $1.66 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Insane potential for improvement,” Musk responded after emphasizing Calacanis’s text
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then Calacanis proposed using a return-to-office mandate to get rid of some of Twitter’s staff without having to pay the typical exit packages
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Twitter’s previous CEO, Jack Dorsey, implemented a “forever” remote-work policy in 2020 that allows Twitter employees to work wherever they are most productive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “2 day a week office requirement = 20% voluntary departures,” Calacanis wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Maybe we don't talk Twitter on Twitter,” Calacanis wrote

                Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods mention “climate change” and “animal welfare” several times on their website and in corporate reports

                Food costs have been a key driver of inflation this year

                Niche fake meat products are likely to struggle in this environment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Products from Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat cost significantly more than traditional meat brands because they lack the economies of scale of their larger competitors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Industry experts believe fake meat brands could take 15 to 20 years to achieve price parity with regular meat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Which means consumers struggling with their grocery bills may have substituted their meat already
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The rapid rise and sudden fall of fake meat holds an important lesson for investors

                Relatives pray during a ceremony for those killed in the attack on the Young Children's Development Center in the rural town of Uthai Sawan, north eastern Thailand, on Oct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Most of the children, aged between two and five, were slashed to death, while adults were shot, police said in the aftermath of the worst child death toll in a massacre by a single killer in recent history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha was set to visit on Friday, and government officials laid royal wreaths and flowers outside the daycare centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police identified the attacker as Panya Khamrap, 34, a former police sergeant who was discharged over drug accusations and who was facing trial on a drugs charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Panya went to the daycare centre to pick up his child after attending court earlier in the day, police spokesperson Paisal Luesomboon told broadcaster ThaiPBS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When he did not find his child there, he began the killing spree
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One witness, Kittisak Polprakan, said he saw the attacker calmly walking out of the centre after the massacre, "as if he was just taking a normal stroll"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police official Chakkraphat Wichitvaidya told Reuters autopsies showed the children had been slashed with a large knife, sometimes multiple times, and adults shot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He didn’t say anything, he shot at the door while the kids were sleeping," said another woman, becoming distraught
            </p>
            
            <p>
                About 30 children were at the centre when the attack began, fewer than usual as heavy rain had kept many people away, said district official Jidapa Boonsom
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hundreds of people posted condolences on the Facebook page of the Mutahi Sawant Child Development Centre under its last post before the massacre, an account of a visit the children made to a Buddhist temple in September

                In a statement, the retirement fund said the lower investment income was due to the market reaction to the elevated risk of both slower global growth and high inflation, not experienced by major economies since the 1970s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The EPF’s total gross investment income for the second quarter (2Q22) was RM11.14bil, down RM3.63bil from RM14.77bil recorded in the same quarter last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Equities continued to be the main contributor of income for 2Q22 at RM4.88bil, accounting for 44% of the total gross investment income in the quarter under review
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The consistent downtrend impacted EPF’s equity earnings, especially through global stock markets, which declined between 17% and 21% during the 1H 2022.” “Nonetheless, the EPF’s diversification into different asset classes, markets, and currencies, as prescribed in its strategic asset allocation (SAA), has helped the EPF to remain resilient against turbulent market conditions and to protect its long-term investment returns,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                EPF said this portfolio was gradually becoming more important for the EPF’s diversification efforts as the volatility in listed equity markets remained high
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fixed income instruments, comprising Malaysian Government Securities and equivalent, as well as loans and bonds, contributed a significant portion of gross investment income for 2Q22, at 42% of total income or RM4.73bil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2Q22, the EPF’s overseas investments, which make up 36% of EPF total investment assets, generated RM5.51bil in income, representing 49% of the total gross investment income recorded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taking into account the effect of the RM2.15bil that was written down for listed equities during the quarter, the EPF’s total investment income in 2Q22 was RM8.98bil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the EPF’s asset growth remained healthy as contributions received amounting to RM43.23bil as at June 2022 supported by the income generated from its investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was attributed to the strong growth of new member registrations of 177,230 in the second quarter of 2022 to a total of 323,416 for the 1H22, adding to the total number of EPF members as at June 2022 of 15.5 million

                Indonesian police said they are bringing criminal charges against three officers and three civilians for their roles in the deaths of 131 people last Saturday when police fired tear gas inside a stadium, setting off a panicked run for the exits in which many were crushed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prabowo said charges are also being brought against the chief executive of the match, the chief security officer and three police officers

            <p>
                He said the Malang police head of operations is believed to have known that FIFA, the international governing body, has advised against the use of tear gas in stadiums
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "However, he did not prevent or prohibit the use of tear gas when securing the match," Prabowo said in a televised news conference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the two other police officers had ordered their subordinates to fire the tear gas

            <p>
                Those rules don't necessarily apply to domestic or national leagues but nevertheless are a safety standard, as is the recommendation against the use of tear gas as a crowd-control measure

            <p>
                Following the defeat, angry fans rushed into the infield, prompting police to fire the tear gas

            <p>
                "In our investigation, we found there was no emergency plan to handle special cases as is required in the Football Association of Indonesia's 2021 security and safety regulations," Prabowo said

            <p>
                “The challenge with smartphone phone numbers is that people are using them as their primary number and you get into the habit of giving that number out to everyone,” Kelso said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And in the case of handing out your phone number to everyone, there is a good chance that your cellphone number will be leaked in a large-scale data breach.” Shawn Kobzej also has been struggling with spam calls and said this is what happened to him a couple of months ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “My phone just wouldn’t stop ringing all day long and it was just terribly annoying.” Along with not giving out personal numbers, Kelso said people can set up a second, free number through companies like WhatsApp or Google voice or talk to phone companies about programs to reduce robocalls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After phone numbers are in the hands of scammers, Kelso said cybercriminals can spoof, or mimic, numbers and use them to call people in that area, making the call seem more realistic

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kelso said the reason cybercriminals do this is to get victims to react

                About Us Advertise BEIJING, Oct 7 — When Xi Jinping took power in 2012, some observers predicted he would be the most liberal Communist Party leader in China’s history, based on his low-key profile, family backstory and perhaps a degree of misguided hope

                IT was reported that travellers arriving in or leaving Malaysia will now have to fill up Customs declaration forms

                "To comply with the provisions of this legislation for passengers arriving in Malaysia by air, RMCD requests the cooperation of all airlines entering Malaysia to make announcements to all passengers on the requirement to fill up Form K7 and to submit it to the duty officer of Customs at the airport," he said

                Calls for the non-Bumiputera matriculation quota to be increased from 10 per cent may echo, now and then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, we must broaden the definition of who ‘deserves’ to get admission or scholarships
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is difficult to deny that they should be given a chance to pursue their education programme of choice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We also reduce academic ability to exam results
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Does higher education open enough space for them? Second, we need to go beyond demanding more non-Bumiputera spaces in matriculation colleges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, while a larger non-Bumiputera quota in matriculation (currently 10%) seems a morally appealing and pragmatic solution, this will cause a rush of already high-scoring Chinese and Indian students into this easier pre-university programme, and exacerbate inequalities within the community by compounding the disadvantage of those who miss out on the matriculation spots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Would those who object to preferential treatment for Bumiputeras also object to preferential treatment for Orang Asli university applicants? The solution is not to sweepingly abolish ethnicity-conscious admissions, but to strike a balance of academic, socioeconomic and student diversity considerations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, how can Malaysia do better? First, matriculation and STPM must be revamped — basically made more rigorous, with a focus on equipping students for higher education instead of providing an easier pathway to university
            </p>
            
            <p>
                System-wide change, including the prospect of a single university entrance examination, is not feasible until we narrow the quality gap in the parallel university entry programmes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Admission to university is surely too important to be left to a computer algorithm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A further round of selection can be formulated to balance out student diversity — not just by ethnicity, but also region, language, and other aspects

                Calls for the non-Bumiputera matriculation quota to be increased from 10 per cent may echo, now and then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, we must broaden the definition of who ‘deserves’ to get admission or scholarships
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is difficult to deny that they should be given a chance to pursue their education programme of choice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We also reduce academic ability to exam results
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Does higher education open enough space for them? Second, we need to go beyond demanding more non-Bumiputera spaces in matriculation colleges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, while a larger non-Bumiputera quota in matriculation (currently 10%) seems a morally appealing and pragmatic solution, this will cause a rush of already high-scoring Chinese and Indian students into this easier pre-university programme, and exacerbate inequalities within the community by compounding the disadvantage of those who miss out on the matriculation spots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Would those who object to preferential treatment for Bumiputeras also object to preferential treatment for Orang Asli university applicants? The solution is not to sweepingly abolish ethnicity-conscious admissions, but to strike a balance of academic, socioeconomic and student diversity considerations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, how can Malaysia do better? First, matriculation and STPM must be revamped — basically made more rigorous, with a focus on equipping students for higher education instead of providing an easier pathway to university
            </p>
            
            <p>
                System-wide change, including the prospect of a single university entrance examination, is not feasible until we narrow the quality gap in the parallel university entry programmes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Admission to university is surely too important to be left to a computer algorithm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A further round of selection can be formulated to balance out student diversity — not just by ethnicity, but also region, language, and other aspects
            </p>

                About Us Advertise GENEVA, Oct 7 — The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday voted against debating alleged widespread abuses in China’s Xinjiang region after intense lobbying by Beijing, in a heavy setback for Western nations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The United States and allies last month brought a draft decision targeting China to the UN’s top rights body, seeking as a bare minimum a discussion on Xinjiang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move came after former UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet released her long-delayed Xinjiang report, citing possible crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the far-western region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in a moment of knife-edge drama, countries on the 47-member council in Geneva voted 19-17 against holding a debate on human rights in Xinjiang, with 11 nations abstaining
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amnesty International branded the vote farcical, while Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it betrayed abuse victims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The United States condemns today’s vote preventing a discussion about Xinjiang,” US ambassador to the council Michele Taylor tweeted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Washington and some Western countries have used Xinjiang “to spread rumours and cause trouble, engaging in political manipulation under the guise of human rights, attempting to smear China’s image,” a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One Western diplomat stressed that regardless of the outcome, “the number one objective has been fulfilled” in putting Xinjiang in the spotlight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amnesty secretary general Agnes Callamard said Thursday’s vote put the council in “the farcical position of ignoring the findings of the UN’s own human rights office”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “For council member states to vote against even discussing a situation where the UN itself says crimes against humanity may have occurred makes a mockery of everything the Human Rights Council is supposed to stand for.” HRW’s China director Sophie Richardson called it an “abdication of responsibility and a betrayal of Uyghur victims”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China launched an all-out offensive to dismiss Bachelet’s report

                About Us Advertise GENEVA, Oct 7 — The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday voted against debating alleged widespread abuses in China’s Xinjiang region after intense lobbying by Beijing, in a heavy setback for Western nations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The United States and allies last month brought a draft decision targeting China to the UN’s top rights body, seeking as a bare minimum a discussion on Xinjiang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move came after former UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet released her long-delayed Xinjiang report, citing possible crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the far-western region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in a moment of knife-edge drama, countries on the 47-member council in Geneva voted 19-17 against holding a debate on human rights in Xinjiang, with 11 nations abstaining
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amnesty International branded the vote farcical, while Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it betrayed abuse victims
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The United States condemns today’s vote preventing a discussion about Xinjiang,” US ambassador to the council Michele Taylor tweeted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Washington and some Western countries have used Xinjiang “to spread rumours and cause trouble, engaging in political manipulation under the guise of human rights, attempting to smear China’s image,” a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One Western diplomat stressed that regardless of the outcome, “the number one objective has been fulfilled” in putting Xinjiang in the spotlight
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amnesty secretary general Agnes Callamard said Thursday’s vote put the council in “the farcical position of ignoring the findings of the UN’s own human rights office”

                About Us Advertise NEW YORK, Oct 7 — A rebound of Covid-19 symptoms in some patients after taking Pfizer’s antiviral Paxlovid may be related to a robust immune response rather than a weak one, US government researchers reported on Thursday

                “Our findings suggest that a more robust immune response rather than uncontrolled viral replication characterizes these clinical rebounds,” the team wrote

                The study involved six people whose Covid symptoms returned after taking Paxlovid, and two with rebound symptoms after apparent recovery who did not take the pills

                A woman reacts as people gather outside a day care center which was the scene of a mass shooting, in the town of Uthai Sawan, around 500 km northeast of Bangkok in the province of Nong Bua Lam Phu, Thailand October 6, 2022

            <p>
                Most of the children who died at the daycare centre in Uthai Sawan, a town 500 km (310 miles) northeast of Bangkok, on Thursday were stabbed to death, police said, marking one of the worst child death tolls in a massacre by a single killer in recent history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the attack, he went home and shot dead his wife and child before turning his weapon on himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The age range of children at the daycare centre ranged from two to five years, a local official said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From the first step when I went in, it felt harrowing," Piyalak Kingkaew, an emergency worker heading the first responder team, told Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We’ve been through it before, but this incident is most harrowing because they are little kids."   The former policeman had been in court earlier in the day and had then gone to the daycare centre to collect his child, police spokesperson Paisal Luesomboon told broadcaster ThaiPBS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When he did not find his child there, he began the killing spree, Paisal said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I don't know (why he did this), but he was under a lot of pressure," Panya's mother told Nation TV, citing debt the former policeman had clocked up and his drug taking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Photographs taken at the daycare centre by the rescue team and shared with Reuters showed the tiny bodies of those killed laid out on blankets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He was heading towards me and I begged him for mercy, I didn’t know what to do," one distraught woman told ThaiPBS, fighting back tears
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He didn’t say anything, he shot at the door while the kids were sleeping," another woman said, becoming distraught

                Most of the children, aged between two and five, were slashed to death, while adults were shot, police said in the aftermath of the worst child death toll in a massacre by a single killer in recent history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha was set to visit on Friday, and government officials laid royal wreaths and flowers outside the daycare centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police identified the attacker as Panya Khamrap, 34, a former police sergeant who was discharged over drug accusations and who was facing trial on a drugs charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Panya went to the daycare centre to pick up his child after attending court earlier in the day, police spokesperson Paisal Luesomboon told broadcaster ThaiPBS

            <p>
                One witness, Kittisak Polprakan, said he saw the attacker calmly walking out of the centre after the massacre, "as if he was just taking a normal stroll"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police official Chakkraphat Wichitvaidya told Reuters autopsies showed the children had been slashed with a large knife, sometimes multiple times, and adults shot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He didn’t say anything, he shot at the door while the kids were sleeping," said another woman, becoming distraught

                About 30 children were at the centre when the attack began, fewer than usual as heavy rain had kept many people away, said district official Jidapa Boonsom

            <p>
                Hundreds of people posted condolences on the Facebook page of the Mutahi Sawant Child Development Centre under its last post before the massacre, an account of a visit the children made to a Buddhist temple in September

                A woman reacts as people gather outside a day care center which was the scene of a mass shooting, in the town of Uthai Sawan, around 500 km northeast of Bangkok in the province of Nong Bua Lam Phu, Thailand October 6, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After leaving the daycare centre filled with dead, dying and wounded, the ex-officer went home and shot dead his wife and son before turning his weapon on himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police identified the attacker as Panya Khamrap, 34, a former police sergeant who had been discharged over drug allegations and who was facing trial on a drugs charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An autopsy report indicated he had not used them on the day of the attack, national police chief Damrongsak Kittipraphat said on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One witness, Kittisak Polprakan, said he saw the attacker calmly walking out of the daycare centre - a pink, one-storey building surrounded by a lawn and small palm trees - after the massacre "as if he was just taking a normal stroll"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Most of the children, aged between two and five, were slashed to death, while adults were shot, police said in the aftermath of one of the world's worst child death tolls in a massacre by a single killer in recent history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government would try its best to take care of the families and the prime minister asked everyone to "be strong to get through this great loss," said government spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He didn’t say anything, he shot at the door while the kids were sleeping," said another woman, becoming distraught
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hundreds of people posted condolences on the Facebook page of the Uthai Sawan Child Development Centre under its last post before the massacre, an account of a visit the children made to a Buddhist temple in September

Martin Keown picked up on how Arteta 'wants perfection' and 'sets the bar high' Arteta's men struggled against Liverpool last season, losing 6-0 across the two Premier League fixtures.  This season already looks different though, with the Gunners top of the league and Liverpool languishing in ninth.  Joe Cole added that Arteta is 'creating a culture and right to demand excellence because Arsenal are trying to go up against City and win the Europa league.'

                A video of Tsang, 69, planting a kiss on the lips of 26-year-old Malaysian model Lebara during her birthday celebration recently has caused a stir after the latter posted it on her Instagram account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was just a kiss and birthday wish

                China Press quoted local news reports as saying that the 18-year-old, whose surname is Wang, had met a woman via social media a week ago, and she invited him to meet up on Oct 1

                Tuan Ibrahim, who is also the Environment and Water Minister, said the letter was sent on Wednesday night after a meeting of all the party components of Perikatan in Shah Alam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He confirmed that the palace had received the letter on the same night

                At a Perikatan event on Wednesday night, it was revealed that the letter dated Oct 3 was signed by the 12 Cabinet ministers of Bersatu and PAS to state that they were against the general election being held this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The letter stated the Meteorological Department’s forecast of a severe monsoon and to allow the nation’s economy to recover

            <p>
                Perikatan has repeatedly stated they disagreed with holding the polls during the flood season

                PAS has even decided that all three state assemblies under its rule will not be dissolved until the monsoon is over in March next year

                Later in the evening, Perikatan component party heads once again met for their presidential council at Bersatu’s headquarters

                Bersatu deputy president Datuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu, who is also the Sports and Youth Minister, said that it was a scheduled meeting between the component party heads of Perikatan and was nothing out of the extraordinary

                The Gunners have only signed one permanent player aged over 30 since Arteta's appointment and a deal for Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante would go against that policy

On a free transfer?  That is a question Stan and Josh Kroenke may pose to the Spaniard when N’Golo Kante’s contract expires in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since Arteta's arrival in January 2020, Arsenal have signed 16 first-team players permanently at an average age of 23.7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal proudly made history last month when Ethan Nwaneri became the first 15-year-old to play in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Kante would surely be a game-changer should the Gunners bolster their midfield next summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Even at 31 years old, he’s on a free at the end of this season,” he told talkSPORT
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I would take him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I don’t think it would ever happen because for what Arteta’s trying to build, Kante is too old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Kante is on a free at the end of this season, there will be top teams around the world that will still be queuing up for his signature.” Reports on the continent have linked Kante with Arsenal in recent weeks

                The Gunners have only signed one permanent player aged over 30 since Arteta's appointment and a deal for Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante would go against that policy

On a free transfer?  That is a question Stan and Josh Kroenke may pose to the Spaniard when N’Golo Kante’s contract expires in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since Arteta's arrival in January 2020, Arsenal have signed 16 first-team players permanently at an average age of 23.7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal proudly made history last month when Ethan Nwaneri became the first 15-year-old to play in the Premier League

            <p>
                However, Kante would surely be a game-changer should the Gunners bolster their midfield next summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Even at 31 years old, he’s on a free at the end of this season,” he told talkSPORT
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I would take him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I don’t think it would ever happen because for what Arteta’s trying to build, Kante is too old
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Kante is on a free at the end of this season, there will be top teams around the world that will still be queuing up for his signature.” Reports on the continent have linked Kante with Arsenal in recent weeks

                The theme of Budget 2023, which aims to build on the current momentum of economic recovery and continue with reforms to enhance socio-economic resilience, will be dotted through the various Budget proposals as promised a few months ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The World Bank had forecast GDP growth for Malaysia to hit 4.2% in 2023

            <p>
                Last month, Tengku Zafrul said the government was optimistic the economy in the third quarter of this year would show stronger growth based on current positive economic indicators

                “We want 2023 to be the year where we do reforms ..

            <p>
                for the global economy in 2023, which is expected to be more challenging, our country should be more prepared to take the right steps as the economic forecast for the next year depends on the global economic situation,” he said in the report

            <p>
                Bank Islam in its report on Budget 2023 expected total budget allocation to come in higher between 2.0% and 2.5% than in 2022

            <p>
                The fiscal deficit is another headline number that will bear watching and HSBC Global Research forecasts Malaysia to register a fiscal deficit of around 6% this year based on revenue and expenditure data through the first half of 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                HSBC said that after three years of high fiscal deficits, it expected a smaller deficit of 4.9% of GDP next year

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 — The prime minister did not require the Cabinet’s agreement to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to dissolve Parliament, constitutional experts said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is arguable that the doctrine applies in the case of requesting to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It can also be argued collective responsibility only apply to general accountability of government to Parliament but not to the dissolution of Parliament,” he said when contacted by Malay Mail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Article 40 of the Federal Constitution holds that the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall act on the advice of Cabinet in the execution of his constitutional powers, although Article 40(2)(b) provides him with discretionary powers with regards to the dissolution of Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Article 55 further states that the Agong has the power to dismiss or dissolve Parliament, but does not specify that this must be on the advice of the Cabinet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nik Ahmad Kamal said that while the prime minister should rightly consult the Cabinet before proposing to dissolve Parliament, his ministers’ view did not have any legal bearing on his decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bar Council constitutional law committee co-chair Andrew Khoo explained that while it was not expressly stated, it was the convention that the prime minister has the absolute discretion to advise the Agong to dissolve the Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While consulting the Cabinet before proposing to dissolve Parliament would be politically important for a prime minister, Khoo believed it was not legally required
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But now, if the PM advises [the Agong] for the dissolution of Parliament, it does not yet represent the entire Cabinet of ministers representing the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Perikatan Nasional secretary-general Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin insisted that the Cabinet’s views must be considered before the prime minister sought to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob responded by saying it was his sole prerogative as the prime minister to decide when to advise the Agong to dissolve Parliament
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 — The prime minister did not require the Cabinet’s agreement to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to dissolve Parliament, constitutional experts said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is arguable that the doctrine applies in the case of requesting to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It can also be argued collective responsibility only apply to general accountability of government to Parliament but not to the dissolution of Parliament,” he said when contacted by Malay Mail
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Article 40 of the Federal Constitution holds that the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall act on the advice of Cabinet in the execution of his constitutional powers, although Article 40(2)(b) provides him with discretionary powers with regards to the dissolution of Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Article 55 further states that the Agong has the power to dismiss or dissolve Parliament, but does not specify that this must be on the advice of the Cabinet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nik Ahmad Kamal said that while the prime minister should rightly consult the Cabinet before proposing to dissolve Parliament, his ministers’ view did not have any legal bearing on his decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bar Council constitutional law committee co-chair Andrew Khoo explained that while it was not expressly stated, it was the convention that the prime minister has the absolute discretion to advise the Agong to dissolve the Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While consulting the Cabinet before proposing to dissolve Parliament would be politically important for a prime minister, Khoo believed it was not legally required
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But now, if the PM advises [the Agong] for the dissolution of Parliament, it does not yet represent the entire Cabinet of ministers representing the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Perikatan Nasional secretary-general Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin insisted that the Cabinet’s views must be considered before the prime minister sought to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob responded by saying it was his sole prerogative as the prime minister to decide when to advise the Agong to dissolve Parliament
            </p>

                With United stunningly trailing to a first-half goal from Karim Ansarifard, Rashford came on at the interval and scored one and set up another for Anthony Martial to turn the game on its head within 20 minutes of his arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford added United's third with six minutes remaining before Omonia ensured a nervy finale after Nikolas Panagiotou immediately pulled a goal back

            <p>

            <p>
                Substitutes turn it around for Manchester United after a scare Omonia Nicosia had only won one of their previous 26 European fixtures beyond the qualifying rounds when they welcomed Manchester United to the GSP Stadium on Thursday night but they still managed to give Erik ten Hag's side a scare
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United should have been out of sight well before Omonia scored their first and it was fortunate that Rashford and Martial were on hand to mount a rescue act in the second half

                United are prepared for Ronaldo to mount another push to leave Old Trafford if he cannot win a regular place in Erik ten Hag's team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United are aware that he could look to move in January in a bid to find regular first-team football
            </p>
            
            <p>
                UEFA rules would allow Ronaldo to sign for a team in the Champions League in January and play in the knockout rounds in the new year despite having made three appearances for United in the Europa League this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite Ronaldo's well-known desire to move in the summer, United only received one firm offer from a club in Saudi Arabia, a bid that was dismissed by both Ronaldo's camp and United

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that Ten Hag is understanding of Ronaldo's situation but would be reluctant to let him leave in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barca president Joan Laporta told ESPN in the summer that Messi's "chapter" at the club deserves a better ending than the one it got last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Messi also has interest from Major League Soccer, where Inter Miami would be his most likely destination
            </p>

                Pep Guardiola masterminded Manchester City's derby demolition of Manchester United last Sunday by targeting Lisandro Martinez, sources told ESPN, but his tactical plan had nothing to do with the defender's height

                United are prepared for Ronaldo to mount another push to leave Old Trafford if he cannot win a regular place in Erik ten Hag's team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United are aware that he could look to move in January in a bid to find regular first-team football
            </p>
            
            <p>
                UEFA rules would allow Ronaldo to sign for a team in the Champions League in January and play in the knockout rounds in the new year despite having made three appearances for United in the Europa League this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite Ronaldo's well-known desire to move in the summer, United only received one firm offer from a club in Saudi Arabia, a bid that was dismissed by both Ronaldo's camp and United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                7 is "pissed off" with his lack of game time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sources have told ESPN that Ten Hag is understanding of Ronaldo's situation but would be reluctant to let him leave in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barca president Joan Laporta told ESPN in the summer that Messi's "chapter" at the club deserves a better ending than the one it got last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Messi also has interest from Major League Soccer, where Inter Miami would be his most likely destination

                What can I do about avoiding the required minimum distribution (RMD) tax bite? I have a steady stream of other income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, the question of avoiding the tax bite on RMDs is common
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Read on for strategies you can take to ease RMD tax repercussions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor may help you understand how to manage the tax repercussions of your RMDs.  Take RMDs Correctly No matter your age, there are proactive steps you can take to prepare for the RMD tax bite
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tax-deferred accounts are individual accounts, and RMDs cannot be covered for one spouse by taking a distribution from another spouse's account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you only have a single IRA or 401(k), you can focus on the amount to distribute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This provision of the tax code allows account holders to distribute funds directly from their IRAs to a qualified charity, removing the distribution from taxable income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                tax system is progressive, meaning the higher your taxable income, the more tax you pay on each dollar of income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This can significantly reduce the amount of taxes paid once RMDs begin
            </p>

                I'm over age 72
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What can I do about avoiding the required minimum distribution (RMD) tax bite? I have a steady stream of other income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, the question of avoiding the tax bite on RMDs is common
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Read on for strategies you can take to ease RMD tax repercussions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor may help you understand how to manage the tax repercussions of your RMDs.  Take RMDs Correctly No matter your age, there are proactive steps you can take to prepare for the RMD tax bite
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tax-deferred accounts are individual accounts, and RMDs cannot be covered for one spouse by taking a distribution from another spouse's account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you only have a single IRA or 401(k), you can focus on the amount to distribute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This provision of the tax code allows account holders to distribute funds directly from their IRAs to a qualified charity, removing the distribution from taxable income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                tax system is progressive, meaning the higher your taxable income, the more tax you pay on each dollar of income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This can significantly reduce the amount of taxes paid once RMDs begin
            </p>

                An account named 'Ten Hag's Reds!' has set up a petition on website Change in a bid to get Haaland banned from playing football altogether

                Ng Kok Wai faces one charge of housebreaking for climbing over the balcony of the victim's cabin and then entering her cabin to commit theft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ng Kok Wai, 29, had argued that he cannot be tried or held criminally liable by the Singapore courts because he was on a foreign ship outside Singapore when the acts were allegedly committed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                District Judge Kow Keng Siong said that when a crime has been committed on a cruise ship operating from Singapore involving Singapore citizens and residents, Singapore's criminal law must have the ability to bring the perpetrator to justice
            </p>

                Ng faces one charge of housebreaking for climbing over the balcony of the victim's cabin and then entering her cabin to commit theft

            <p>
                He also faces a charge of theft for stealing the victim's bra and a piece of her luggage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was agreed that the legal issue - whether the Act has the effect of extending Singapore's criminal law to extraterritorial acts committed on foreign ships - should be determined before proceeding with his trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the course of arguments, a question arose over which provision under the Act should have been used
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution said it chose section 180 as it extended Singapore criminal law to extraterritorial acts, and also conferred jurisdiction on the Singapore courts to try the charges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Judge Kow said section 178 ought to be stated as the applicable provision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He concluded that section 178 extended Singapore's criminal law to acts committed on foreign ships outside Singapore, while section 180 gave Singapore courts the authority to try offences committed outside Singapore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The housebreaking charge carries up to 10 years' jail and a fine, while the theft charge carries up to seven years' jail and a fine.

                “We have seen an appreciable and troubling deterioration in Treasury market liquidity,” said Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “What we are seeing at the moment is a reminder that the work is really important.” When the Treasuries market broke down amid a panicked rush into dollar cash in March 2020, the Fed swooped in as buyer of last resort
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The biggest nightmare for the Fed now is that they have to step in and buy debt,” said Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If the Fed has to step in -- when it’s in conflict to monetary policy -- it really puts them in a bind,” she said
            </p>
            
            <p>

                The White House’s reaction was swift, calling the decision “shortsighted” and accusing the oil cartel of “aligning with Russia.” Saudi Arabia, which controls about one-third of OPEC’s oil reserves and is seen as a US ally, has not heeded president Joe Biden’s plea against taking such a drastic step

                Anticipation of OPEC’s decision this week has already lifted oil prices to more than $90 a barrel

            <p>
                The cut in production, in reality, will be lower than 2 million because OPEC and its allies have been underproducing

                In August, the coalition missed its targets by 3.58 million barrels per day

            <p>
                In Nigeria, for instance, oil production hit a 32-year-low amid pipeline vandalism and theft

            <p>
                Earlier, in May, Biden reached into the US’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep oil prices, and therefore petrol prices, in check

                After the OPEC+ cuts, he might have to resort to releasing more oil again

                They argue a ban would “decrease inventory levels, reduce domestic refining capacity, put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices, and alienate US allies during a time of war.” 🇻🇪The US is looking to ease sanctions on Venezuela to allow Chevron, the last major US oil producer operating in the country, to pump oil there

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cut in production, in reality, will be lower than 2 million because OPEC and its allies have been underproducing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In August, the coalition missed its targets by 3.58 million barrels per day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Nigeria, for instance, oil production hit a 32-year-low amid pipeline vandalism and theft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, in May, Biden reached into the US’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep oil prices, and therefore petrol prices, in check
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the OPEC+ cuts, he might have to resort to releasing more oil again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They argue a ban would “decrease inventory levels, reduce domestic refining capacity, put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices, and alienate US allies during a time of war.” 🇻🇪The US is looking to ease sanctions on Venezuela to allow Chevron, the last major US oil producer operating in the country, to pump oil there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil could make up for lost Russian supplies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                🛢️Falling oil prices are prompting OPEC to take drastic measures 🤑The White House will lower gas prices today by purchasing oil tomorrow 📉 Lower gas prices are making Americans feel better about everything else
            </p>

                About Us Advertise PETALING JAYA, Oct 10 — PKR has today launched a website to allow party members and members of the public to register themselves as prospective candidates to contest under the party’s ticket, for the upcoming 15th general election (GE15) PKR deputy president Rafizi Ramli said that those who are keen, can register their names at www.calonkeadilan.org, and the party is expecting at least 10,000 nominations to come in

            <p>

            <p>
                The CPTPP was signed on March 8, 2018 and had been ratified and implemented in stages by Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam and Peru

                The agreement would allow Malaysia to gain priority access to new markets in Canada, Mexico and Peru

                “While most industry research groups still expect positive semiconductor sales growth in 2022, most project an average of 4% year-on-year decline for semiconductor industry sales in 2023, mainly due to an anticipation of a slowdown in the global economy and inventory correction

            <p>
                In the same report, CGS-CIMB Research said it was downgrading the Malaysian semiconductor sector from “overweight” to “neutral” in view of the weaker industry demand and sluggish earnings prospects over the next six to 12 months

                “While most industry research groups still expect positive semiconductor sales growth in 2022, most project an average of 4% year-on-year decline for semiconductor industry sales in 2023, mainly due to an anticipation of a slowdown in the global economy and inventory correction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Moreover, we expect softer quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) industry sales in the third quarter of 2022 (3Q22) due to the weak guidance from 15 global semiconductor chip manufacturers (ex-memory) – on average, they project a tepid 1% sequential sales growth in 3Q22,” it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The research house said it also expected the Malaysian semiconductor sector – automated test equipment (ATE) and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) firms – to register a q-o-q decline of 5% in sales and 8% in net profit on aggregate in 3Q22

            <p>
                In the same report, CGS-CIMB Research said it was downgrading the Malaysian semiconductor sector from “overweight” to “neutral” in view of the weaker industry demand and sluggish earnings prospects over the next six to 12 months
            </p>

                On Wednesday, Russia's ambassador to the United States responded saying Washington's decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses an "immediate threat" to Moscow's interests, prolongs the bloodshed, and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the West

            <p>
                In the notice of application, the Pekan MP named the government, the Home Minister and the Commissioner-General of Prisons as the first, second and third respondents, respectively

            <p>
                In his supporting affidavit, Najib said the department had rejected his request, citing “security grounds”, on Sept 28
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Michael Owen had held the record, taking him 48 games.   Erling Haaland has trounced all before him since arriving in the Premier League this summer The raw statistics lay bare what a mockery of the Premier League Haaland is making at the moment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One-time boy wonder Michael Owen held the record for the fewest number of games to score three Premier League hat-tricks Salah's Premier League season record - 32 goals  Having been cast out by Chelsea, Mohamed Salah returned to the Premier League with a vengeance after rebuilding his career at Roma.  In his first proper season in England, Salah broke through all before him, scoring 32 league goals as Liverpool finally began to look like a force to be reckoned with both domestically and in Europe.  His season was most notable for his performances in Europe, guiding Liverpool to their first Champions League final since 2007, but his league tally ensured he put himself above Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez in enjoying the most prolific 38-game Premier League season ever.  Haaland could trump his record in 20 games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamed Salah could soon see his 38-game Premier League goal-scoring record beaten Should the Manchester City forward continue scoring at his current rate of 1.75 goals per game, Salah's record could be gone by the time the champions travel to Manchester United on January 14.  Nobody needs any reminder what Haaland did to Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez in their most recent fixture.  Even factoring in some sort of second half of the season slow down, Haaland could conceivably have wrapped up the record by the time the Champions League roles around again in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Son Heung-min was emotional after sharing the golden boot last term - Haaland could soon have surpassed the South Korean's tally All-time Premier League goal scoring record - 260 goals  There has been much debate over whether or not Alan Shearer's record of 260 goals can ever be broken
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former Newcastle and England striker's final goal in the league came on April 17, 2006, fittingly against Sunderland.  Haaland's arrival, and his start to life in the Premier League, now has supporters questioning whether it is a case of when, not if.  Should he continue hitting the back of the net at his astonishing rate, Shearer's record will be matched within 141 games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Harry Kane, the likeliest candidate at present to trouble Shearer's record, has scored his 190 Premier League goals in 290 appearances at a rate of 0.66
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he could edge himself further up the Catalan's stellar list of players coached by getting close to Messi's league goalscoring record.  Haaland could surpass the tally with games to spare at his current rate - nine to be exact.  The Argentine scored seven hat-tricks that season, Haaland could match that figure after just 15 games.   Lionel Messi (R) enjoyed a miraculous season in 2011-12, notching 50 goals alone in the league English single season goalscoring record - 60 goals A statistic that has survived pretty much all the major events in modern history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only 36 fixtures to surpass the legendary Everton forward.  Many questioned whether or not Haaland would adapt to life quickly in the Premier League after a difficult start to life in the Community Shield against Liverpool at the end of July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How laughable those doubts look now.  Injury free, why can't he challenge one of English football's most esteemed records?  Haaland is looking to break Dixie Dean's record for most goals in a single English season of 60 - a record that has stood since 1928

                Harry Kane, the likeliest candidate at present to trouble Shearer's record, has scored his 190 Premier League goals in 290 appearances at a rate of 0.66
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he could edge himself further up the Catalan's stellar list of players coached by getting close to Messi's league goalscoring record.  Haaland could surpass the tally with games to spare at his current rate - nine to be exact.  The Argentine scored seven hat-tricks that season, Haaland could match that figure after just 15 games.   Lionel Messi (R) enjoyed a miraculous season in 2011-12, notching 50 goals alone in the league English single season goalscoring record - 60 goals A statistic that has survived pretty much all the major events in modern history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only 36 fixtures to surpass the legendary Everton forward.  Many questioned whether or not Haaland would adapt to life quickly in the Premier League after a difficult start to life in the Community Shield against Liverpool at the end of July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How laughable those doubts look now.  Injury free, why can't he challenge one of English football's most esteemed records?  Haaland is looking to break Dixie Dean's record for most goals in a single English season of 60 - a record that has stood since 1928

                Unclaimed money is defined as funds that are legally owned by the public but remained unclaimed, or money that has been dormant in various accounts for many years

            <p>
                The spokesman urged the public to check for unclaimed money through its eGUMIS, AGD counters nationwide, or via gazetted records in the National Library

            <p>

            <p>
                theSun also spoke to several individuals to gauge their level of awareness about unclaimed money

            <p>
                “My parents have friends who know about reclaiming money from the AGD

                “Those of my generation may also have money left dormant in forgotten accounts, and we should visit the eGUMIS website and claim it

            <p>
                It’s our money after all.” A quantity surveyor who wished to be known only as Sarah, 27, said she is unaware of unclaimed money

            <p>
                Unclaimed money is defined as funds that are legally owned by the public but remained unclaimed, or money that has been dormant in various accounts for many years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The AGD spokesman said there are three categories of unclaimed money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spokesman urged the public to check for unclaimed money through its eGUMIS, AGD counters nationwide, or via gazetted records in the National Library
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The public may apply to claim their money via online, counter or registered post
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The public is also advised to refer to its online portal for procedures to retrieve unclaimed money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                theSun also spoke to several individuals to gauge their level of awareness about unclaimed money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “My parents have friends who know about reclaiming money from the AGD
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Those of my generation may also have money left dormant in forgotten accounts, and we should visit the eGUMIS website and claim it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s our money after all.” A quantity surveyor who wished to be known only as Sarah, 27, said she is unaware of unclaimed money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I have never heard about it or read anything on social media regarding unclaimed money
            </p>

            <p>
                All in, the number of luxury units sold to foreigners in Singapore in the first eight months of this year - including those with permanent residency - has outpaced the 282 in the same period in pre-pandemic 2019 and the 322 in 2018

                In a bulk purchase in June, one Chinese tycoon splurged over S$85 million on 20 new units in central Singapore, while another Chinese buyer snapped up four units for around S$60 million

            <p>
                In a press conference broadcast on his Facebook page on Thursday (Oct 6), the PKR deputy president said this was alongside nominations from its members and leaders to help the party widen its talent pool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The website has been launched today and will be online until next Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said those who fill in the nomination forms will be subject to certain conditions under the official website and they will go through a screening process by the nomination committee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "A scoring system will be used by the nomination committee to rank the candidates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because only the top five candidates will be discussed by the nomination committee and their candidacy will be decided by the president and myself as the party election director
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, Rafizi said, online nominations are open for all 222 parliamentary and state assembly seats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "But we know that PKR will only compete in certain seats when the seat negotiation process ends next week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If the competition between the candidates is balanced, PKR's central elections department will conduct a final process which is a telephone survey to evaluate the candidate by contacting voters in the area, that is around 500 to 600 people," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi also said that individuals nominated by the party branches or wings will be given additional marks in the evaluation process since they are believed to have the ability to help the party in the election.

                "If the competition between the candidates is balanced, PKR's central elections department will conduct a final process which is a telephone survey to evaluate the candidate by contacting voters in the area, that is around 500 to 600 people," he said

                Rafizi also said that individuals nominated by the party branches or wings will be given additional marks in the evaluation process since they are believed to have the ability to help the party in the election.

                The Selangor Sultan, who is also the National Council of Islamic Religious Affairs (MKI) chairman, said the MKI muzakarah committee played a very important role and function in the Muslim community in Malaysia and is a tower of legal reference at the national and international levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, since each state had its own fatwa committee, there is bound to be conflicts between state fatwas and muzakarah decisions at the national level as well as between one state and another
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This legal ruling by the muzakarah committee is a collective ijtihad (ijtihad jama'i) of all the muftis of the states assisted by experts in certain fields," said Sultan Sharafuddin in his speech during the 121st MKI muzakarah committee meeting at Masjid Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, Shah Alam, Selangor on Wednesday (Oct 6)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sultan Sharafuddin added that the coordination and standardisation of fatwas by the muzakarah committee do not touch or affect the authority of the Sultan and Rulers in the states as the Head of Religion, as stated by Regulation 9 (1) of the MKI Regulations 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to procedure, the decisions and views of the muzakarah committee would be informed to the MKI, which was chaired by Sultan Sharafuddin

            <p>
                "This is important to ensure that muzakarah decisions at the national level and fatwas at the state level are not influenced by elements of party politics," said Sultan Sharafuddin

                Cheah Tek Kuang, who is currently a non-independent and non-executive director of the bank, went over to the Pekan MP’s home in Langgak Duta as he was tasked to get Najib’s signature for various forms to open a current account with AmBank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As he arrived at the residence in a car, Cheah said that Low, better known as Jho Low, came out from another car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To a question by Najib’s lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah during the RM2.28bil 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) trial yesterday, Cheah said Low did not interact with him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness also testified that prior to the meeting at Najib’s home, he had met Low before as Low had wanted to meet with him as the bank’s managing director
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah said the meeting with Low was in a social setting and not for business
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But he has a habit of turning up late,” he said, adding that Low would be late for more than 30 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After two or three meetings, where Low still turned up late, Cheah said he did not entertain further meeting requests from Low
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday, Cheah had testified that the bank account was opened to receive a US$100mil from Saudi Arabia, which he was told was a contribution for Najib’s work in championing Islam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uma Devi who testified that Najib had never made cash withdrawals from his AmBank accounts despite the billions deposited in it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The same witness also testified that a sum of RM2.08bil flowed in Najib’s bank account ending 694 through nine transactions in 2013

                Cheah Tek Kuang, who is currently a non-independent and non-executive director of the bank, went over to the Pekan MP’s home in Langgak Duta as he was tasked to get Najib’s signature for various forms to open a current account with AmBank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As he arrived at the residence in a car, Cheah said that Low, better known as Jho Low, came out from another car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To a question by Najib’s lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah during the RM2.28bil 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) trial yesterday, Cheah said Low did not interact with him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness also testified that prior to the meeting at Najib’s home, he had met Low before as Low had wanted to meet with him as the bank’s managing director
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah said the meeting with Low was in a social setting and not for business
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But he has a habit of turning up late,” he said, adding that Low would be late for more than 30 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After two or three meetings, where Low still turned up late, Cheah said he did not entertain further meeting requests from Low
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday, Cheah had testified that the bank account was opened to receive a US$100mil from Saudi Arabia, which he was told was a contribution for Najib’s work in championing Islam
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uma Devi who testified that Najib had never made cash withdrawals from his AmBank accounts despite the billions deposited in it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The same witness also testified that a sum of RM2.08bil flowed in Najib’s bank account ending 694 through nine transactions in 2013

                Lawyer Alaistair Brandah Norman, who is part of Najib's defence team, informed High Court judge Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah that Muhammad Shafee has fever and severe throat infection, rendering him unable to address the court here on Thursday (Oct 6)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have to inform that Tan Sri (Muhammad Shafee) has taken ill this morning and was given a medical leave for four days, starting today until Oct 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was unable to attend the Court of Appeal matter this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “For 1MDB trial arrangement next week on Oct 11, we asked for a case management to be fixed at 2.30pm as Tan Sri has been instructed to attend another appeal case before Judicial Commissioner Azhar Abdul Hamid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He is required to submit on six grounds for a case that has been going on since 1999 and would not be able to come for the morning trial session,” Norman said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defence also requested for the 1MDB hearing scheduled on Oct 12 to start later in the day as Muhammad Shafee will be in another High Court before Justice Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid

            <p>
                Justice Sequerah said these witnesses would be kept hanging if such delay continues and asked for the prosecution to arrange for a new witness to ensure there is a continuity in the trial
            </p>

                Gareth Southgate will have to re-jig his defence if Walker is ruled out of the World Cup The 32-year-old has become a key player in Gareth Southgate's England squad over the years, earning 70 caps, the majority of which have come on the right side of a back three in recent times
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Walker does miss out, this would leave Southgate with an unwanted defensive conundrum to solve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A back three of Stones, Dier and Maguire (and don't forget Coady) Walker only just returned from injury in time to make England's squad for their Nations League clashes against Italy and Germany last month.  With this in mind, Southgate started him on the bench for the latter fixture and went with a back three of John Stones, Eric Dier and Harry Maguire
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Southgate may want to rely on John Stones and Harry Maguire, but they are currently injured Eric Dier is back in the England setup and could play alongside Stones and Maguire His absence would leave England with an alarming lack of pace at the back if they go with Stones, Dier and Maguire
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no guarantee that either man will get much game time between now and the World Cup, too, and playing them either side of Dier in a back three could be deemed a risk by Southgate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another option to slot into a back three would be the reliable Conor Coady
            </p>
            
            <p>
                James has played on the right side of a back three for Chelsea on a number of occasions over the last 18 months, and Southgate could be tempted to shift him inside from his wing-back position to add a little more pace centrally
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Switch to a back four Walker has been a fundamental part of England's back three under Southgate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Surely there is no need for a back five against Iran, Wales and the United States?  It is a concern that Stones has largely operated as the central player in a back three for England, while James can play centrally but is currently thriving as a right-back at Stamford Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Southgate may be better off keeping James on the right flank, settling on a centre-back partner for Stones and reverting to a back four rather than asking these players to move away from their best roles just to keep the back three intact.

                In addition to the regular variants, the German carmaker also revealed updated AMG options for those who want more performance

                The latter is now a single bar of light at the top of each cluster instead of an L-shaped design on the previous car

            <p>
                Without the AMG package, the standard look features small faux side intakes at the corners of the bumper and the single slat running through a Mercedes-Benz logo sits atop a black grille insert
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The aggressive theme that you get with the AMG package applies to the rear bumper too, which has faux corner outlets and a diffuser element sandwiched between the chrome exhaust finishers – the standard look has a more reserved design
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While we are at the rear, both the hatchback and sedan retain the shape of their taillight clusters, although the lighting signature has been tweaked for the facelift

                As before, dual screens dominate the dashboard and they come in two configurations, with the base option consisting of a seven-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.25-inch central touchscreen, while the upgraded option includes dual 10.25-inch displays instead

                The Parking Package also now supports longitudinal parking and offers, among other things, a 360-degree camera with 3D images

                The space, in a four-storey River Valley shophouse, is about 60sq m in size, as big as a two-bedroom condo unit in the area
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I considered buying a home, but it’s a big commitment for the long term and I wanted to explore living in different types of places,” said Guay, 29, who has been renting the space run by CP Residences since June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                CP Residences chief executive Wendy Yap said the tenant mix across its co-living apartments has changed from one that is being largely composed of foreigners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A shift in mindset in the local population towards renting compared with buying, and the time it takes for the young to attain home ownership due to increasing property prices, are some factors that have propelled the increase,” she said.Those aged 29 to 34 yearn to have their own space away from their family home, and more young couples turn to co-living spaces before buying a flat, Yap added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cove co-founder Luca Bregoli said some are “impatient to have their own space and freedom”, citing couples living at Cove co-living spaces while waiting for their Build-To-Order (BTO) flats
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Co-living spaces offer a good option – for her, the draw was the three-month lease term offered by Figment, which manages the co-living space in a heritage shophouse in the city centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The S$3,900 (RM12,685)-a-month rent is “a lot of money that’s not going towards a mortgage”, she noted, but it is worth it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Most landlords ask for a two-year lease and I prefer not to commit for so long
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I also really like (the) aesthetics of the shophouse I’m living in, it’s very traditional and has that old charm to it.” Bregoli said the Covid-19 pandemic has been a major driving factor behind the surge in popularity for co-living spaces
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With the new normal of hybrid work and work-from-home, more people value the community and social aspect of shared housing,” he added

                One of the most common ways to create this income is to buy yourself an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Essentially, an annuity is an insurance contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will generally be a minimum payment that guarantees you don’t lose your principal, but it’s possible that the money won’t grow at all, which is not a concern with a fixed annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of this is determined when you buy your annuity contact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That percentage only ticks up to 95.9% if you use an annuity, not enough of a difference to justify using an annuity

            <p>
                Social Security Bridge – Another Option Morningstar also details an alternative plan for making sure you have enough money in retirement without having to buy an annuity, a strategy known as the Social Security Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you turn 70, you file for Social Security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you start taking these payments, you can reduce the amount of money you take out of your retirement accounts each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Morningstar analysis, though, shows that if you have at least 36 times your needed annual income saved at the time of retirement, you likely don’t need to get an annuity

                A 529 plan can be a powerful way to save for college, offering tax-free growth and other tax benefits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the past, there was a downside to a grandparent 529, though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here’s how the grandparent 529 loophole works
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor could help you put a financial plan together for your family’s education needs and goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How Grandparent 529 Distributions Were Treated on FAFSA While distributions from grandparent 529s weren’t directly reported on the FAFSA in the past, they were counted as untaxed student income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So a large distribution from a grandparent 529 could detrimentally impact their grandchild’s need-based eligibility because of its treatment as student income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So let’s say a grandparent saved $35,000 in a 529 plan to cover one year of college for their grandchild
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That $35,000 distribution would be counted as student income, which would then be reported on the FAFSA, effectively reducing the student’s financial aid package by $17,500
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other Benefits of a Grandparent 529 Plan In addition to being a smart way for grandparents to help their grandkids save for college, grandparent 529 plans also have valuable tax and estate planning benefits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You’re allowed to change the beneficiary of a grandparent 529 plan as well, and this flexibility can be useful
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tips for Managing a 529 plan A financial advisor could help you create a financial plan for your family’s education

                To further support SMEs recovery in the post-Covid era, limited to two years only, PH suggested reducing the lowest tax threshold for SMEs to 15 per cent from 17 per cent and the chargeable income subjected to this rate should be increased to the first RM1 million instead of RM600,000

                Najib’s lawyer Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee confirmed to Malay Mail that his client’s application for judicial review was filed at the High Court in Kuala Lumpur this afternoon at around 1pm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Farhan confirmed that the scheduled Dewan Rakyat dates which Najib was seeking to attend are the dates from October 3 to November 29
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shahid is scheduled to hear Najib’s application for leave for judicial review on October 12
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In this lawsuit, Najib is seeking six main reliefs or court orders, including a certiorari order to quash or set aside the commissioner-general’s decision to not allow Najib access to his officers or aides for parliamentary, legislative and constituent work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The remaining three court orders sought by Najib are for a certiorari order to quash or set aside the commissioner-general’s decision to not allow him to attend Parliament on the scheduled dates of Parliament sittings; and a declaration that he is “entitled” to attend Parliament on such dates; and a mandamus order to compel the respondents to take the necessary steps to allow his attendance of Parliament on such dates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The full Dewan Rakyat schedule for the remaining meeting this year would be October 3 to 7, October 11 to 13, October 17 to 20, October 26 and 27, October 31 to November 3, November 7 to 10, November 14 to 17, November 21 to 24, and November 28 and 29
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah is currently scheduled to be heard on October 3 to 6, October 11 to 13, November 7 to 10, November 14 to 17, November 21 to 24, December 5 to 8, December 12 to 15, before continuing in January and February next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s lead defence lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah had on Monday denied that the bid to have his client be allowed to attend Parliament is an attempt to delay the 1MDB trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib had on September 19 wrote to the Kajang Prison director-general to ask for access to his officers three times a week for parliament and constituent matters and to be allowed to attend Parliament under prison supervision to carry out his duties as MP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In conveying the government’s and commissioner-general’s decision, the Kajang prison had in a September 28 letter informed Najib that his application had been rejected on security or safety reasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Najib had filed an appeal to the home minister on September 30, the minister has yet to reply at the time the lawsuit was filed this afternoon.

                Najib’s lawyer Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee confirmed to Malay Mail that his client’s application for judicial review was filed at the High Court in Kuala Lumpur this afternoon at around 1pm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Farhan confirmed that the scheduled Dewan Rakyat dates which Najib was seeking to attend are the dates from October 3 to November 29
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shahid is scheduled to hear Najib’s application for leave for judicial review on October 12
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In this lawsuit, Najib is seeking six main reliefs or court orders, including a certiorari order to quash or set aside the commissioner-general’s decision to not allow Najib access to his officers or aides for parliamentary, legislative and constituent work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The remaining three court orders sought by Najib are for a certiorari order to quash or set aside the commissioner-general’s decision to not allow him to attend Parliament on the scheduled dates of Parliament sittings; and a declaration that he is “entitled” to attend Parliament on such dates; and a mandamus order to compel the respondents to take the necessary steps to allow his attendance of Parliament on such dates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The full Dewan Rakyat schedule for the remaining meeting this year would be October 3 to 7, October 11 to 13, October 17 to 20, October 26 and 27, October 31 to November 3, November 7 to 10, November 14 to 17, November 21 to 24, and November 28 and 29
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah is currently scheduled to be heard on October 3 to 6, October 11 to 13, November 7 to 10, November 14 to 17, November 21 to 24, December 5 to 8, December 12 to 15, before continuing in January and February next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s lead defence lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah had on Monday denied that the bid to have his client be allowed to attend Parliament is an attempt to delay the 1MDB trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib had on September 19 wrote to the Kajang Prison director-general to ask for access to his officers three times a week for parliament and constituent matters and to be allowed to attend Parliament under prison supervision to carry out his duties as MP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In conveying the government’s and commissioner-general’s decision, the Kajang prison had in a September 28 letter informed Najib that his application had been rejected on security or safety reasons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Najib had filed an appeal to the home minister on September 30, the minister has yet to reply at the time the lawsuit was filed this afternoon.

                She also urged women to find courage to try something new, something they are afraid of and just widen their experience and knowledge in various fields
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She said they would be surprised at what they can accomplish, not to mention the wonderful experience gained, as well as the new friendships made throughout their journey by trying out something new.

                (Bloomberg) -- Some of Wall Street’s biggest banks aren’t buying this stock-market rally

                and Bank of America Corp., in revising its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 3,500 from 4,450 in 2022, which implies a drop of nearly 5% from Monday’s close

            <p>
                Valuation risks for the benchmark index “will persist well into 2023, and most downside in the coming months will come from slowing profitability,” which threatens to push the S&P 500 as low as 3,200 in the fourth quarter, according to Max Kettner, HSBC’s chief multi-asset strategist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That puts the firm’s year-end target below the average of 4,346 in the last Bloomberg survey conducted in mid-September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Monday, Credit Suisse strategists lowered their year-end goal for the S&P 500 by 10% to 3,850, citing the prospect of weakening corporate earnings growth next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last month, Goldman slashed its 2022 target for the index to 3,600 from 4,300 on a higher-rate scenario
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite this year’s selloff, Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian said on Monday that there is “no full capitulation on Wall Street yet.” Last month, Subramanian reaffirmed the bank’s year-end target of 3,600

                “As the Fed signals a pause or even an end to its rate hike cycle, this should bring some well-needed relief, lifting the S&P 500 to 4,000 by year-end 2023,” HSBC’s Kettner said

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement was accurate and with no exaggeration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee said the statement was made in response to queries by media members about the money that was deposited into Najib's accounts

                At this juncture, senior Deputy Public Prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram responded, saying that his only complaint was that Muhammad Shafee could have raised the matter in court

                On Tuesday (Oct 4), Sri Ram warned Muhammad Shafee from conducting a trial in the media of the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was in response to a media statement by Muhammad Shafee on Monday (Oct 3) which highlighted the inflow of funds into Najib's account in February and June 2011 amounting to about RM60.6mil (about US$20mil) from Saudi royalty, Prince Faisal Turki Al Saud
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee also said the prosecution had only highlighted the two transfer transactions, but did not highlight five other transfers into Najib's account between Aug 2011 and Aug 2012 which were allegedly from Prince Turki and the Ministry of Finance Riyadh amounting to about US$180mil
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee had also included letters from the former governor that were addressed to Najib, stating different sums of donations made to the former premier

            <p>
                The trial then proceeded with 39th prosecution witness, former AmBank non-executive director Cheah Tek Kuang, taking the witness stand to be cross-examined by Muhammad Shafee

                The PSSP was set up on Aug 2 to further scrutinise the proposed Tobacco and Smoking Control Bill (GEG) which was tabled by Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin in Dewan Rakyat on July 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, no vote was taken on the Bill during the second reading on Aug 2 with a motion passed instead to refer the matter to a bi-partisan PSSC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee also recommended that a clause is also included to make community service a punishment for offenders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PSSC also agreed with the Attorney General's Chambers that those penalised under the GEG will not be subject to a criminal record or a non-registrability of smoking offence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Tuesday (Oct 4), Khairy said that the GEG Bill will be tabled in Parliament on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the Bill could be passed by Dewan Rakyat on Thursday (Oct 6) or after the Budget 2023 debate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, he said it was uncertain if the Bill would be tabled in Dewan Negara if the Parliament is dissolved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He noted that like other Bills that do not make it to Dewan Negara if Parliament is dissolved, it has to be tabled again in Dewan Rakyat by the new government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dewan Rakyat's meeting is scheduled to end on Nov 29 while Dewan Negara will meet from Nov 21 to Dec 7.

                A youth chief from a division in Selangor said the election machinery has to be ready as the 15th General Election (GE15) could be called at any time now

                In response to a question, he said Umno was confident the Yang di-Pertuan Agong would be guided by the Federal Constitution when it comes to the issue of the dissolution of Parliament

            <p>
                On whether Umno had given the Prime Minister a deadline on when to seek an audience with the King to request a dissolution, Ahmad Zahid said the party had no authority on this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is up to the Prime Minister

            <p>
                On criticism over Umno’s insistence that the general election be held this year, Ahmad Zahid said that while the party respected the views of other parties, they too should accept Umno’s stand

                All differences must be set aside for Umno to move as a strong entity,” he said

            <p>
                A youth chief from a division in Selangor said the election machinery has to be ready as the 15th General Election (GE15) could be called at any time now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are all committed to ensuring a strong win for Umno and Barisan Nasional,” he said

                In response to a question, he said Umno was confident the Yang di-Pertuan Agong would be guided by the Federal Constitution when it comes to the issue of the dissolution of Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On whether Umno had given the Prime Minister a deadline on when to seek an audience with the King to request a dissolution, Ahmad Zahid said the party had no authority on this
            </p>

                On criticism over Umno’s insistence that the general election be held this year, Ahmad Zahid said that while the party respected the views of other parties, they too should accept Umno’s stand

                “I must first of all profusely apologise to my learned friend if there was a misconstruction of the purpose of the media statement,” Shafee said in court, proffering an apology to lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram who warned the defence yesterday against conducting the 1MDB trial through the media

            <p>

            <p>
                “My only point is he could have raised this before Your Lordship, because he has to fight in court, we cannot fight in the media

            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Shafee conceded that it was only “fair” not to publicly comment on how the prosecution runs its case and limit his remarks to the media on how the defence does it when the judge pointed out that Sri Ram was saying that any comment on the way the prosecution is conducting the 1MDB case should be raised in the courtroom and not outside
            </p>

                Cheah had yesterday related in court how he had gone to Najib’s house to open a new personal account with AmIslamic Bank during which the latter directly told him that US$100 million would be deposited into the new account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Cheah, Najib said the money was from Saudi Arabia and purported it was a donation for his “Islamic activity”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Cheah reiterated that Najib volunteered the information about the US$100 million “donation” from the Saudi Arabian government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In his testimony yesterday, Cheah related that he had met privately with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) governor Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz to tell her about Najib’s new bank account and the latter’s expectation of US$100 million from Saudi Arabia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah agreed with Shafee today that it was a private bank account and that it was just a matter of courtesy for him to inform the BNM governor about it

                Datuk Seri Najib must follow all the rules,” Cheah added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meeting Najib at his house for opening of account  Cheah said AmBank's then relationship manager Joanna Yu informed him in 2011 that “VVIP” client Najib wanted to open an account with the bank, and she felt it was not good protocol-wise for her to meet the then prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah said it was the first time he was dealing with Najib, adding that Azman asked him to attend to the matter of helping Najib open the bank account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah said Azlin sent a driver to pick him up from his house to go to Najib’s, confirming that they were the only two occupants in the car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Chea affirmed that he saw Low Taek Jho – better known as Jho Low — at Najib’s house during that visit when asked by Shafee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He confirmed that he met Najib alone to set up the latter’s bank account

                Najib's wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, who was in the courtroom also giggled at parts of Cheah's testimony

                Watching local team Arema FC play on Saturday was a special outing for soccer fan Andi's family, including his two-year-old son

            <p>
                The overcrowded stadium in Malang in Indonesia's East Java province descended into chaos after police fired tear gas to disperse agitated fans who had poured on to the pitch at the end of the match
            </p>

            <p>
                Sputtering and stumbling through the tear gas, they managed to get to medics for help
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Soccer's world governing body FIFA bans the use of "crowd control gas" at matches and an Indonesian police watchdog has said some officers wrongly used tear gas inside the stadium when there were no orders to do so

                Kuala Lumpur police chief Comm Datuk Azmi Abu Kassim said the 31-year-old victim was kidnapped at about 11pm on Sept 28

                A man emerged and dragged the victim into the vehicle before they drove away," he told reporters at the KL police headquarters on Wednesday (Oct 5)

                By Anirban Sen (Reuters) - Elon Musk's U-turn on buying Twitter Inc could not have come at a worse time for the banks funding a large portion of the $44 billion deal and they could be facing significant losses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As in any large acquisition, banks would look to sell the debt to get it off their books
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Musk will provide much of $44 billion by selling down his stake in electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc and by leaning on equity financing from large investors, major banks have committed to provide $12.5 billion
            </p>

                By Anirban Sen (Reuters) - Elon Musk's U-turn on buying Twitter Inc could not have come at a worse time for the banks funding a large portion of the $44 billion deal and they could be facing significant losses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As in any large acquisition, banks would look to sell the debt to get it off their books
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Musk will provide much of $44 billion by selling down his stake in electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc and by leaning on equity financing from large investors, major banks have committed to provide $12.5 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They include Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp and Barclays Plc

            <p>
                The increase comes days after the return of the F1 Grand Prix race that attracted more than 300,000 people at the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The race was not held in the last two years during the Covid-19 pandemic

            <p>
                Another likely reason for the spike is the large number of people now moving in and out of the country, not just for F1, added Professor Tambyah

                The week-on-week infection ratio was at 1.56, and over the last 28 days, 68,891 people have tested positive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dr Leong said this trend is normal and each new variant will bring a spike in numbers before the situation settles again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said, so far, most people are reporting only a mild cough and sore throat and perhaps, a fever that will last for a few days

            <p>
                “As long as the hospitalised or intensive care case numbers do not spike up significantly, it is acceptable,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MOH website on Tuesday said 286 people were in hospital, up from 257 the day before

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 5 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob's government will be tabling only his second federal Budget on October 7 but it could be the most significant one for his political career
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the 14th Parliamentary term set to expire by next July, Budget 2023 will be an “election Budget” — to be tabled by Finance Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz — regardless of when the 15th general election is held
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, the country’s ninth prime minister is expected to unveil a spending plan that will push his approval ratings up, which means it’s more than likely to be an expansionary Budget
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Given that this is an election Budget, we will likely see some form of bigger spending in terms of government expenditure,” said Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, associate director at Vriens & Partners, a political risk consultancy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No political party can confidently predict how this demographic will cast their votes, or if they will even turn up, posing a challenge for Ismail Sabri and his party as they formulate next year’s spending plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It stands at 2.5 per cent at the moment, still lower than pre-Covid levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Given that this Budget will be tabled before the next general election, we expect it to be election friendly with expansionary measures (i.e

            <p>
                Analysts predict the Ismail Sabri-led government will not only continue with cash handouts and subsidies for targeted groups, but may also announce a higher tax relief for the middle class as well as small- and medium-sized enterprises

            <p>
                in other words, a reintroduction of goods and service tax (GST) at a lower rate than the previous 6 per cent is not expected to be announced,” UOB analysts said.

            <p>
                According to Cheah, Azman declined and instructed him to meet with Najib
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The process to open Najib’s account, Cheah said, was quite special due to his stature as the prime minister at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He could not recall when he met Najib at his Bukit Tunku home, but said that during the meeting, Najib mentioned the money that was coming into the new account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the meeting with Najib, Cheah set up a meeting with Zeti to inform her about the opening of the 694 account and the incoming US$100mil from Saudi Arabia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cheah said only he and Zeti were at the “secret meeting” as it involved the interest of the then prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Zeti took note of the matter and asked that it be done in accordance with the regulations of the bank and the central bank,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I agreed to the code name ‘AmPrivate Banking – MR’ for Najib’s account to avoid misuse of private information,” Cheah said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A letter was also sent to Zeti to inform her of the code name, which would make it easier for the central bank to monitor the account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I am not sure if Najib knew about the code name, but this is a matter that falls under the bank’s operation, hence it was the operations’ duty to choose the codename,” he said.Cheah, whose contract as managing director ended in 2012, said that after the opening of the account, he was no longer involved
            </p>

                Trent Alexander-Arnold has drawn praise for his performance against Rangers Rio Ferdinand said the fullback was like a 'magician' on the ball after the game "He's going to go down as one of the best right-backs we've ever seen in England."The highest of praise for Trent Alexander-Arnold from @rioferdy5..
            </p>

                This team has been built to get the best out of him in an attacking sense.' Alexander-Arnold did have one poor moment when he gave away a free kick just outside the Liverpool box
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If he can create a team where they can protect him defensively, then great.  'He’s going to go down as one of the best right back’s we’ve seen in England
            </p>

                Ferdinand also said he would 'go down as one of the best right back’s we’ve seen in England' For Michael Owen, the fullback was aided by the performance of his captain

                When he's got Henderson in the team, Alexander-Arnold is a different player

            <p>
                Tottenham drew 0-0 with Frankfurt in the Champions League on Tuesday evening in Germany  Former Spurs forward Peter Crouch was full of praise for their much-improved performance Instead, Antonio Conte's side were left frustrated to be heading back to England with just a point

            <p>
                'They had much more control and much more possession,' he told BT Sport after the game.  Spurs created a whole host of openings during the game but were wasteful in front of goal It was their first game since Saturday's dismal 3-1 defeat against rivals Arsenal at the Emirates 'It was the final ball that was missing

                Spurs went into Tuesday's game in Germany having endured a dismal 3-1 defeat to Arsenal in the north London derby on Saturday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tottenham drew 0-0 with Frankfurt in the Champions League on Tuesday evening in Germany  Former Spurs forward Peter Crouch was full of praise for their much-improved performance Instead, Antonio Conte's side were left frustrated to be heading back to England with just a point
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'They had much more control and much more possession,' he told BT Sport after the game.  Spurs created a whole host of openings during the game but were wasteful in front of goal It was their first game since Saturday's dismal 3-1 defeat against rivals Arsenal at the Emirates 'It was the final ball that was missing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They approached the game well and were positive but just the final ball was lacking

                These are among several improvements made by the Election Commission (EC) to allow the public more time to vote, said Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Parliament and Law) Datuk Seri Dr Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mukhriz had asked about the EC’s measures to ensure a high voter turnout rate and to guarantee the transparency of the voting process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During GE14 in 2018, the voter turnout was 82.32% and there were long queues at some polling centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Junaidi said the number of voting centres and channels would be increased this time, taking into account Undi18 – which lowered the voting age to 18 – and automatic voter registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is to avoid any congestion at the voting centres and channels,” he said
            </p>

                The EC had said that there would be 9,560 polling centres for GE15, compared to 9,010 centres previously, while polling streams will increase from 29,054 to 38,990

                These are among several improvements made by the Election Commission (EC) to allow the public more time to vote, said Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Parliament and Law) Datuk Seri Dr Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mukhriz had asked about the EC’s measures to ensure a high voter turnout rate and to guarantee the transparency of the voting process
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During GE14 in 2018, the voter turnout was 82.32% and there were long queues at some polling centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Junaidi said the number of voting centres and channels would be increased this time, taking into account Undi18 – which lowered the voting age to 18 – and automatic voter registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is to avoid any congestion at the voting centres and channels,” he said
            </p>

                Wan Junaidi added that a special lane for voters aged 60 and above and the disabled group (OKU) will also be set up and limited to 450 voters

                The Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Parliament and Law) said the Royal Assent for the Bill was received yesterday

            <p>
                “The law will be enforced against any MP who switches parties from this date onwards,” he added

            <p>
                The law received assent from the King on Aug 31 and was gazetted on Sept 6, but without the date of enforcement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the enforcement of the anti-hopping law, Wan Junaidi said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob would now write to the state governments to adopt the law as part of their own state constitutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Sabah, Sarawak, Kelantan and Penang already have their own anti-hopping laws, Wan Junaidi said the Federal Government wanted the nation to have uniform laws against party hopping
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On another matter, Wan Junaidi said the Prime Minister had the sole discretion to determine Parliament’s dissolution, and as such was not bound to discuss it with anyone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Since Independence, the prime minister has not needed to discuss with the Cabinet the date for the dissolution of Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is at the Prime Minister’s discretion,” he told a press conference in Parliament’s media centre yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Ismail Sabri did raise the matter with the Cabinet two weeks ago, Wan Junaidi said that discussion centred on seeking an audience with the King to propose a date to dissolve Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is up to the discretion of the Prime Minister, and at least the idea (of dissolution) was discussed with the Cabinet,” Wan Junaidi added

                By Yasin Ebrahim Investing.com -- The Dow soared for a second straight day Tuesday, riding high on hopes that the Fed could pivot from its hawkish path of monetary policy tightening as data showed signs of slowing labor demand.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.8%, or 826 points, the Nasdaq was up 3.3%, and the S&P 500 rose 3%

                Liverpool picked up a vital 2-0 win over Rangers in the Champions League on Tuesday, with Jurgen Klopp in positive spirits after the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool looked a more cohesive unit in the process, and speaking after the game, Klopp admitted he liked what he saw
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Good game, the game we wanted to play,” Klopp said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It was a really good defensive performance in a new team structure and offensively we created an awful lot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I liked the game a lot.” The fact that Liverpool stayed in a 4-2-3-1 even when substitutes were made could suggest that they will again line up that way at Arsenal on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Trent Alexander-Arnold roared back to form on Tuesday night, curling home a wonderful free-kick and setting Liverpool on their way to victory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The right-back’s all-round game shone, both going forward and at the back, amid widespread criticism in recent weeks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He played a good game, especially defensively, and scored a wonderful goal,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Trent doesn’t have a defensive problem, we’ve had a defensive problem, because our timing wasn’t right and we take risks defending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It will happen – it’s all good.”    Liverpool’s form has been woeful by their extremely high standard and nobody will be more aware of that than the boss
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are not over the moon about our situation, but tonight I saw a team fully committed and that’s what we have to do.” The real litmus test for Liverpool will now come in the form of Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday, before a trip to Ibrox next week and then the visit of Man City

                Liverpool picked up a vital 2-0 win over Rangers in the Champions League on Tuesday, with Jurgen Klopp in positive spirits after the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool looked a more cohesive unit in the process, and speaking after the game, Klopp admitted he liked what he saw
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Good game, the game we wanted to play,” Klopp said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It was a really good defensive performance in a new team structure and offensively we created an awful lot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I liked the game a lot.” The fact that Liverpool stayed in a 4-2-3-1 even when substitutes were made could suggest that they will again line up that way at Arsenal on Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Trent Alexander-Arnold roared back to form on Tuesday night, curling home a wonderful free-kick and setting Liverpool on their way to victory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The right-back’s all-round game shone, both going forward and at the back, amid widespread criticism in recent weeks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He played a good game, especially defensively, and scored a wonderful goal,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Trent doesn’t have a defensive problem, we’ve had a defensive problem, because our timing wasn’t right and we take risks defending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It will happen – it’s all good.”    Liverpool’s form has been woeful by their extremely high standard and nobody will be more aware of that than the boss
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are not over the moon about our situation, but tonight I saw a team fully committed and that’s what we have to do.” The real litmus test for Liverpool will now come in the form of Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday, before a trip to Ibrox next week and then the visit of Man City
            </p>

                As talk hots up about an impending dissolution of Parliament, the coalition’s chairman, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, said the three states will not go along if the 15th General Election (GE15) is called soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anwar said this was decided after discussions between Pakatan’s Presidential Council and the mentris besar and chief minister of the three states

                Hakan Calhanoglu scored the only goal of the game in first-half stoppage time, but the match ended in controversy when Barca had an equaliser ruled out for handball before they were denied a late penalty when Denzel Dumfries appeared to handle the ball inside the area

                His average position was in his own half with Tsimikas the one to take up a higher position on the flank, keeping Trent to Van Dijk and Matip but still slingshotting forward when the opportunity arose

            <p>
                There was more help at hand with how Liverpool setup and the balance Liverpool struck was just what was needed to restore confidence and bank a solid showing, as Sam also mentioned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On occasion, Nunez and Jota did get on top of each other in attacking positions but Klopp has said they have only had one session to work on the system and was impressed with how they have adapted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It doesn’t help also that Nunez has admitted he doesn’t understand the manager particularly well yet so he can only improve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The double pivot of Thiago and Henderson is perhaps where the system could fall against a team better than Rangers, who can beat Liverpool’s first line of pressure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The midfield has lacked in a 4-3-3 and it has left Liverpool vulnerable too many times, and the form the Gunners are in could make for plenty of chances to slice through the team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I can see Klopp putting Firmino behind Jota in the same formation but I wouldn’t be opposed to keeping Nunez in the side and taking Jota out for Firmino – the good thing is that Liverpool have options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The system, whichever way Klopp goes, is nothing without the intensity and Liverpool have to bring that on Sunday – there’s a statement win waiting to be had

                Kuala Lumpur goalkeeper Kevin Ray Mendoza, making his first start in the AFC Cup, was superb in goal, making six magnificent saves in regulation time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The game ended 0-0 after regulation and extra time at the Sogdiyana Stadium in Jizzakh, Uzbekistan, on Wednesday (Oct 5)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In normal time, Sogdiana was the side with the better chances and possession but could not find a way past Kuala Lumpur’s sturdy defence

                Kuala Lumpur goalkeeper Kevin Ray Mendoza, making his first start in the AFC Cup, was superb in making six saves during that period
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The game entered a penalty shootout to decide who gets to the final to face Omani club Al-Seeb on Oct 22 at the Cheras Football Stadium in Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kuala Lumpur captain Paulo Josue scored the first penalty to beat goalkeeper Shirinboy Abdullaev
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Midfielder Akram Mahinan scored the fourth penalty, and the winning penalty was taken by defender Giancarlo Gallifuoco
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Javokhir Qakhramanov got the ball rolling for Sogdiana by scoring the first penalty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mendoza continued his fine performance when he saved Sogdiana’s second penalty taken by Shakhboz Jurabekov

            <p>
                Luka Cermelj scored the third for Sogdiana but it proved too little too late as Gallifuoco brought the City Boys to the final of the continental competition.

                "In sum, the CPTPP places Malaysia in a strategic position, elevating our competitiveness in the global arena
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As a bloc that advances regional economic integration, the CPTPP is also a testament to the significance of the multilateral trading system," it added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Miti, the CPTPP will broaden Malaysia's access to new markets such as Canada, Mexico and Peru, which are not covered by any existing Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The CPTTP will also elevate Malaysia's prominence as a global trading economy and boost total trade to US$655.9bil in 2030
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In addition, the findings of the CBA also indicate that Malaysia’s exports are projected to reach USD354.7bil in 2030, with trade balance remaining in strong surplus at 8.5% of GDP for the same year," said Miti
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the CPTPP, by January 1, 2033, almost 100% of Malaysian exports to all CPTTP countries will enjoy duty-free treatment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Miti, as soon as the CPTPP enters into force for Malaysia, all of the country's exports to Australia and Singapore will enter these markets without being subjected to any duties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Exports to New Zealand and Canada will be duty-free in 2024 and 2029 respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Miti said the CPTPP contains trade-facilitative Rules of Origin (ROO) that are designed to support modern business practices and further promote deeper integration of Malaysian businesses into regional supply chains
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The Agreement allows Malaysian manufacturers to source raw materials from all CPTPP countries for purposes of fulfilling the ROO requirements and consequently, qualifying for reduction and elimination of import duties," said Miti
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that Malaysian companies will also have immediate access to the government procurement markets of other CPTPP countries at much lower thresholds, as compared to the high thresholds committed by Malaysia

                "In sum, the CPTPP places Malaysia in a strategic position, elevating our competitiveness in the global arena
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "As a bloc that advances regional economic integration, the CPTPP is also a testament to the significance of the multilateral trading system," it added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Miti, the CPTPP will broaden Malaysia's access to new markets such as Canada, Mexico and Peru, which are not covered by any existing Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The CPTTP will also elevate Malaysia's prominence as a global trading economy and boost total trade to US$655.9bil in 2030
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In addition, the findings of the CBA also indicate that Malaysia’s exports are projected to reach USD354.7bil in 2030, with trade balance remaining in strong surplus at 8.5% of GDP for the same year," said Miti
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Under the CPTPP, by January 1, 2033, almost 100% of Malaysian exports to all CPTTP countries will enjoy duty-free treatment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Miti, as soon as the CPTPP enters into force for Malaysia, all of the country's exports to Australia and Singapore will enter these markets without being subjected to any duties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Exports to New Zealand and Canada will be duty-free in 2024 and 2029 respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, Miti said the CPTPP contains trade-facilitative Rules of Origin (ROO) that are designed to support modern business practices and further promote deeper integration of Malaysian businesses into regional supply chains
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The Agreement allows Malaysian manufacturers to source raw materials from all CPTPP countries for purposes of fulfilling the ROO requirements and consequently, qualifying for reduction and elimination of import duties," said Miti
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that Malaysian companies will also have immediate access to the government procurement markets of other CPTPP countries at much lower thresholds, as compared to the high thresholds committed by Malaysia

                In a statement on Tuesday (Oct 4), the ministry said the article was inaccurate, misleading and gave a negative perception of the overall quality of roads in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also said the article used a report published by Zutobi, an online driver's education company as a reference, which calculated the scores based on only four factors – road quality; improvements in road quality; road deaths and the relative size of the road network, and it only took into account data for 59 countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ministry also explained that another report published by Utusan Malaysia on Aug 10 titled "Kualiti Jalan di Malaysia 21 Terbaik di Dunia, Mengatasi Australia, Britain, New Zealand" (Road quality in Malaysia among 21 best in the world, surpassing Australia, Britain, New Zealand), based on the road quality rankings issued by The Global Economy using the data obtained from the Global Competitiveness Index

            <p>
                Based on the news report, Malaysia scored 5.3 points out of the total seven points to be in the 21st position, surpassing Sweden (23), Canada (31), Australia (33) and Britain (37)

                Cheah was explaining how he facilitated the opening of Najib’s current account 211-202-200969-4 on Jan 13, 2011 (known as the “9694” account)
            </p>

                “The purpose of the meeting was to inform her that Najib had opened an account and there were incoming funds of US$100 million from Saudi Arabia,” he said

                The name was assigned to the account “to avoid private information from being misused”

                Earlier, Cheah said he had first gone to Najib’s house in Jalan Langgak Duta, Kuala Lumpur in 2011 to facilitate the opening of the bank account, after being given the green light by AmBank chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 4 — Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said that his party’s alliance with PAS can continue for the next general election (GE15) on the condition that the latter cuts its political ties with Perikatan Nasional (PN)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking after the party’s meeting with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob and other top leaders, Ahmad Zahid said that PAS can even use its own logo when campaigning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if Umno had set a deadline for PAS, Ahmad Zahid only stated it should happen sooner rather than later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his insistence on going solo for GE15, he said that it does not mean Umno is brimming with confidence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But if PAS wants to be with Umno and Barisan Nasional (BN), they are free to use their party symbols
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said that he only demanded that PAS cut ties with Bersatu and PN in order to make Muafakat Nasional (MN) a success
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from meeting the prime minister, Umno held talks with the party’s division leaders on preparations going into GE15 at the World Trade Centre (WTC) here today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I also want to say about Sabah that I have had a discussion with the leadership of GRS, and they have given their assurance that GRS will support all BN candidates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, the charter to uphold MN’s “ummah unification” agenda between PAS and Umno was revived after both party presidents had a four-eye meeting and indicated a possible alliance for the upcoming polls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang’s apparent opposition to GE15 being held this year was seen as a sign that negotiations between the Islamist party and Umno had failed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite that, PAS has yet to conclusively state whether it will work with Umno or Bersatu for GE15.

                It also said that the appointment of KPISoft Malaysia Sdn Bhd to develop the MySejahtera application did not follow procedures set by Putrajaya, and moving forward, the government needs to take a more prudent approach in all procurement processes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wong said while the government had guaranteed that it owned the app, and its data would not be abused, KPISoft was the owner of MySejahtera’s intellectual property
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Cabinet’s decision to procure the app from the app developer goes to show that the app is, in principle, still owned by the developer,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee found that the appointment of KPISoft Sdn Bhd as the MySejahtera application developer in March 2020 was not organised and not in line with the public procurement procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                KPISoft Sdn Bhd, the developer of the MySejahtera application, allowed the government one year to use the app for free and then started to charge the government from April 2021 onward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report said the government was not clear in terms of KPISoft’s appointment, the concept of CSR, and the ownership of MySejahtera
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PAC also found no document showing the one-year time frame set by KPISoft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The development and continuous use of the App should have continued to be a CSR effort
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of April this year, the government had yet to register the intellectual property for the MySejahtera application on MyIPO, which may cause the application to be claimed for ownership by the developer

                The PAC recommended that the government ensure full ownership of the MySejahtera application, besides the need to guarantee the security of users' personal data in the application and ensure that the data is not misused by any party

                It also said that the appointment of KPISoft Malaysia Sdn Bhd to develop the MySejahtera application did not follow procedures set by Putrajaya, and moving forward, the government needs to take a more prudent approach in all procurement processes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wong said while the government had guaranteed that it owned the app, and its data would not be abused, KPISoft was the owner of MySejahtera’s intellectual property
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Cabinet’s decision to procure the app from the app developer goes to show that the app is, in principle, still owned by the developer,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee found that the appointment of KPISoft Sdn Bhd as the MySejahtera application developer in March 2020 was not organised and not in line with the public procurement procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                KPISoft Sdn Bhd, the developer of the MySejahtera application, allowed the government one year to use the app for free and then started to charge the government from April 2021 onward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report said the government was not clear in terms of KPISoft’s appointment, the concept of CSR, and the ownership of MySejahtera
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PAC also found no document showing the one-year time frame set by KPISoft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The development and continuous use of the App should have continued to be a CSR effort
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of April this year, the government had yet to register the intellectual property for the MySejahtera application on MyIPO, which may cause the application to be claimed for ownership by the developer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The PAC recommended that the government ensure full ownership of the MySejahtera application, besides the need to guarantee the security of users' personal data in the application and ensure that the data is not misused by any party

                Lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram today told the High Court of his strong objection to Najib's lead defence lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah's act of issuing a media statement regarding evidence in the ongoing 1MDB trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reading out parts of Shafee's press statement issued on Najib's behalf which claimed that the prosecution had failed to disclose details of five transactions of hundreds of millions that entered Najib's account, Sri Ram said the statement was a "direct attack" on the prosecution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram said this was unfair as the prosecution — which conducts the 1MDB trial in court instead of through the media — could not be making a response in public
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With respect, the accused must conduct his trial in court, he cannot be conducting it in public,” he said, referring to Najib as the accused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “And we are put in an invidious position, because we cannot respond, I cannot respond in public and it is not proper for me to respond in public,” he pointed out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the three letters purportedly by an alleged Saudi prince Saud Abdulaziz Al-Saud which Najib's lawyers had been showing the High Court in the 1MDB trial of purported promises of hundreds of millions of US dollars as a “gift” to Najib, Sri Ram said these same letters had been rejected by all three tiers of the court in the SRC case against Najib
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is fairness to us, but they cannot say suppressed to us
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee was not present when Sri Ram made his objection, as he was said to be unwell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed informed the High Court that he was not in a position to respond to the objection, and that Shafee will be replying the first thing tomorrow morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sri Ram then said he was not inviting judge Collin to make any finding, but that he was merely saying that the prosecution was being put in an "invidious" position by Najib's lawyers as the prosecution was wrongly portrayed to be suppressing evidence

                Saravanan slammed the former human resources minister during the Pakatan Harapan administration for imposing a moratorium on the recruitment of workers from Bangladesh on Sept 1, 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "From Sept 1, 2018 to the change of government, we have been lacking foreign workers," said Saravanan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Once the government changed, we took over, but Covid-19 pandemic hit the country and due to this, we could not take any foreign workers for about three years," he said in his reply to M

                Kulasegaran (PH-Ipoh Barat) during Question Time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saravanan added that he managed to finalise the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Bangladesh and Indonesia during his tenure, saying that both countries are the largest sources of foreign workers for Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kulasegaran had asked the Human Resources Ministry to explain the initiatives taken to address the shortage of foreign workers in various critical sectors including the plantation sector, which had delayed the country's economic recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The number of foreign workers that are currently working in our country at the moment is about 1.24 million in various sectors," said Saravanan in his reply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So within the next one or two months, we expect to see an estimated 2.1 million foreign workers coming into the country," said Saravanan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the ministry will review any future application carefully and in an orderly manner to ensure that Malaysia will not end up being a 'dumping ground' for foreign workers.

                "From Sept 1, 2018 to the change of government, we have been lacking foreign workers," said Saravanan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Once the government changed, we took over, but Covid-19 pandemic hit the country and due to this, we could not take any foreign workers for about three years," he said in his reply to M

                Kulasegaran (PH-Ipoh Barat) during Question Time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saravanan added that he managed to finalise the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Bangladesh and Indonesia during his tenure, saying that both countries are the largest sources of foreign workers for Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kulasegaran had asked the Human Resources Ministry to explain the initiatives taken to address the shortage of foreign workers in various critical sectors including the plantation sector, which had delayed the country's economic recovery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The number of foreign workers that are currently working in our country at the moment is about 1.24 million in various sectors," said Saravanan in his reply
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So within the next one or two months, we expect to see an estimated 2.1 million foreign workers coming into the country," said Saravanan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the ministry will review any future application carefully and in an orderly manner to ensure that Malaysia will not end up being a 'dumping ground' for foreign workers.

                It said in a report tabled in Parliament on Oct 4 that this included the appointment of KPISoft (Entomo) as the app’s developer as this was not done according to government procurement procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee found that the government lacked clarity on the direction of the procurement of the app due to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) concept proposed by KPISoft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The government was confused in terms of the appointment of KPISoft, the CSR concept and the ownership period of the MySejahtera app,” it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This amount is high and goes against the concept of CSR,” said the committee in the report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There are no documents to say that the CSR is only for a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It said however, that the development and continued use of the app should remain a CSR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee also said that as of April, the government has yet to register the intellectual property (IP) for MySejahtera on MyIPO, which means the developer could still lay a claim

                It said in a report tabled in Parliament on Oct 4 that this included the appointment of KPISoft (Entomo) as the app’s developer as this was not done according to government procurement procedure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee found that the government lacked clarity on the direction of the procurement of the app due to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) concept proposed by KPISoft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The government was confused in terms of the appointment of KPISoft, the CSR concept and the ownership period of the MySejahtera app,” it said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This amount is high and goes against the concept of CSR,” said the committee in the report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There are no documents to say that the CSR is only for a year

            <p>
                It said however, that the development and continued use of the app should remain a CSR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The committee also said that as of April, the government has yet to register the intellectual property (IP) for MySejahtera on MyIPO, which means the developer could still lay a claim

                Leicester City's James Maddison scored two first-half goals as they beat promoted Nottingham Forest 4-0 on Monday to move off the bottom of the table with their first Premier League win of the season

                The pressure, for now, is off Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers, who looked and sounded like someone who could no longer get the best out of his squad following a 6-2 loss at Tottenham Hotspur before the international break

                We just didn't play to the levels, but we've been able to reset that." The Foxes, who had taken one point from their first seven games and were the only winless side in the top flight, moved ahead of Forest on goal difference
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maddison broke the ice with the first in the 25th minute, his shot from just outside the box deflected in off the arm of Forest defender Scott McKenna, and Harvey Barnes doubled the lead two minutes later with a stellar shot from distance
            </p>

                It was a stellar all-round display from Maddison, who was disappointed to be overlooked in the latest England squad despite having strong form for much of 2022

                The defeat was a fifth in a row for Forest, piling pressure on manager Steve Cooper as he tries to gel a team packed with new signings, and Leicester's first clean sheet in the league this season

                Just days after the Umno supreme council decided that Parliament must be dissolved this year, the Prime Minister will be at a special meeting today with Umno division leaders and the party president

            <p>
                On Thursday, he will have an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong

            <p>
                While this could be just their regular weekly meet, there is much talk that the question of the King’s consent for dissolution will arise during the meeting

                Just days after the Umno supreme council decided that Parliament must be dissolved this year, the Prime Minister will be at a special meeting today with Umno division leaders and the party president

                Pep Guardiola has managed to turn Haaland in to the perfect striker to link up the play Boss Guardiola (R) is getting more out of Haaland and he can get even better if it continues I mentioned Shearer's mental strength at the start of this column because I saw that first-hand when we formed the SAS at Blackburn

                Guardiola is getting more out of Haaland than ever - and this is only the beginning.

                Manchester United will allow Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Old Trafford in the January transfer window, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo’s future at United has looked increasingly in doubt since the start of the season as he has started just one of the club’s seven Premier League games so far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Erik ten Hag and United were adamant that Ronaldo would not be sold in the summer, but according to The Telegraph, both the club and the manager have agreed to let the Portugal international depart if a suitable offer arrives in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report claims that Ronaldo is still hoping to leave United before the end of the season but has remained ‘highly professional’ despite his lack of playing time under Ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo was left on the bench for United’s 6-3 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, with Ten Hag admitting that he didn’t want to disrespect the 37-year-old by bringing him on as a substitute when the team were trailing by four goals by half time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                video Speaking after the 6-3 defeat to City, former United captain Roy Keane accused the club of ‘disrespecting’ Ronaldo by keeping him in the summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘I think the manager holding onto him, okay, you say you need options, but if you don’t hold onto Ronaldo to sit on the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But generally speaking, the bigger picture, he’s not going to play Ronaldo, we know that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ‘Okay, Ronaldo’s motivated with the World Cup coming up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if he’s sitting on the bench for Man United week in week out, it’s not good

                He reportedly agreed with Fernandes and Martinez and let them criticise his squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bruno Fernandes and Lisandro Martinez led a furious inquest at half-time against Man City Erling Haaland and Phil Foden both scored hat-tricks as Pep Guardiola's side cruised to victory It looked as though United's half-time team talk had worked when Antony got one back with a superb strike from distance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester City's staff could reportedly hear Fernandes and Martinez raging at half-time Fernandes hit out at his team after the game saying their attitude and belief 'was not the best' Fernandes, in his post match interview, admitted the attitude and belief displayed by his team 'was not the best'
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'We keep control more, we control the game more
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'We are really disappointed but now it's time to focus on the next game and understand that we have to get back to the performances that we did before — in the belief and everything, in the togetherness principle — and understand that this cannot get us down.' It was the second time this season that United had been 4-0 down at the break, following their defeat by the same score line to Brentford back in August

            <p>
                Bruno Fernandes and Lisandro Martinez led a furious inquest at half-time against Man City Erling Haaland and Phil Foden both scored hat-tricks as Pep Guardiola's side cruised to victory It looked as though United's half-time team talk had worked when Antony got one back with a superb strike from distance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester City's staff could reportedly hear Fernandes and Martinez raging at half-time Fernandes hit out at his team after the game saying their attitude and belief 'was not the best' Fernandes, in his post match interview, admitted the attitude and belief displayed by his team 'was not the best'

                'We are really disappointed but now it's time to focus on the next game and understand that we have to get back to the performances that we did before — in the belief and everything, in the togetherness principle — and understand that this cannot get us down.' It was the second time this season that United had been 4-0 down at the break, following their defeat by the same score line to Brentford back in August

                Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens praise Gonzalo Higuain, but ask if his career could have been even better after the striker announced his retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Higuain, 34, will play out the rest of the season with Miami, which is currently in the playoff positions in Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference with two games left to play
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But despite regaining his form for the Herons, a tearful Higuain told a press conference on Monday morning that he was calling time on his career at the end of the 2022 MLS campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                the time has come to say goodbye." Higuain began his professional career with Argentine giants River Plate in 2005 after progressing through the club's youth system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Higuain departed after seven seasons in Madrid, moving to Napoli in the summer of 2013 for $53.1m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the summer of 2016, Juventus activated a release clause in Higuain's contract, allowing them to acquire the Argentine for just under $100m, a Serie A record at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After an impressive initial season that saw him score 32 goals, Higuain's production soon dropped off, leading the Bianconeri to loan him out to be both AC Milan and Chelsea during the 2018-19 campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After one final season with Juventus in 2019-20, in which he helped the club to a third Serie A title during his tenure there, Higuain moved to Inter Miami, where he has scored 27 goals and added 14 assists in 65 league appearances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "My biggest motivation is helping my teammates," Higuain said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was part of the Juventus side that lost the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League final, 4-1 to Real Madrid, as well as the Argentina side that fell to Germany in the 2014 World Cup final, a match that saw Higuain spurn several chances, including a one-on-one with Germany keeper Manuel Neuer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Higuain will still go down as one of the better forwards of his generation, having scored over 300 goals at club level

            <p>
                In the summer of 2016, Juventus activated a release clause in Higuain's contract, allowing them to acquire the Argentine for just under $100m, a Serie A record at the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After an impressive initial season that saw him score 32 goals, Higuain's production soon dropped off, leading the Bianconeri to loan him out to be both AC Milan and Chelsea during the 2018-19 campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After one final season with Juventus in 2019-20, in which he helped the club to a third Serie A title during his tenure there, Higuain moved to Inter Miami, where he has scored 27 goals and added 14 assists in 65 league appearances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "My biggest motivation is helping my teammates," Higuain said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was part of the Juventus side that lost the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League final, 4-1 to Real Madrid, as well as the Argentina side that fell to Germany in the 2014 World Cup final, a match that saw Higuain spurn several chances, including a one-on-one with Germany keeper Manuel Neuer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Higuain will still go down as one of the better forwards of his generation, having scored over 300 goals at club level
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 4 — Lawyer Datuk Zaid Ibrahim has called for a suspension of all high-profile criminal court cases involving politicians until a new attorney general is appointed replacing incumbent Tan Sri Idrus Harun
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Pending the appointment of a new AG, which is bound to take place after the coming general election, all high-profile cases ought to be suspended,” Zaid was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zaid said there were concerns of selective prosecution in those cases and cited excerpts from a recent book authored by former AG Tan Sri Tommy Thomas — who is now under investigation for sedition among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also blamed Idrus for creating a “negative perception” of the justice system after dropping the bribery and money laundering charges against Baling MP Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim without explanation
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Zaid, who was briefly disgraced ex-prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s defence lawyer in the latter’s last SRC International Sdn Bhd appeal at the Federal Court, listed the ongoing court cases against Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Umno Johor chief Tan Sri Shahrir Samad, as well as DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng, and Muda president Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He faulted Idrus for doing nothing to inspire confidence, especially after Najib’s conviction for SRC International
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also claimed “everyone knows” that the trial judge in Najib’s SRC International case should have recused himself due to “serious conflict of interests” and that the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) had issued a report to confirm this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zaid claimed that Najib was “wrongly convicted” as a result of the combination of Thomas’ alleged “indiscretions” and Idrus’ “inaction”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was granted a one-year extension till March 2023 when his two-year contract expired this year.

                Warren Buffett is widely considered to be one of the most successful investors of all time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Berkshire trades at about $400,000 and Buffett has a net worth of $97 billion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This strategy involves selling an option where you promise to buy a stock at a specific strike price below its current value sometime in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This immediately gives you money from the sale of the option
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the share price doesn’t fall, you keep the money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the price does fall below the strike price, you purchase the stock at a price that’s less than you would have paid at the time you sold the option, with the cash from the option sale further reducing your cost basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is a good strategy on a stock that you wouldn't mind owning in the first place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The option is considered “naked” because you haven’t secured another option to buy the stock, such as shorting shares of that same stock to offset your purchase cost
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But just because those little outfits are off-limits to Buffett today doesn’t mean you can’t go after them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Buffett’s “buy and hold” approach doesn’t extend to never admitting that even he sometimes gets it wrong
            </p>

                Why do they refuse to give Malaysian car owners adaptive cruise control?

            <p>
                If you want to drive that car – buy a BMW You’re kinda right because E300 has adaptive cruise so your driver can chauffeur you around if you trust the system

                On Friday, Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Koerner reassured staff that the bank has a “strong capital base and liquidity position” and told employees that he will be sending them a regular update until the firm announces a new strategic plan on Oct
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Koerner, who was named CEO in late July, has had to deal with market speculation, banker exits and capital doubts as he seeks to set a path forward for the troubled Swiss bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Credit Suisse’s market capitalization dropped to around 10 billion Swiss francs, meaning any share sale would be highly dilutive to longtime holders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The market value was above 30 billion francs as recently as March 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Credit Suisse executives have noted that the firm’s 13.5% CET1 capital ratio at June 30 was in the middle of the planned range of 13% to 14% for 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The five-year credit default swaps price of about 250 basis points is up from about 55 basis points at the start of the year and is near their highest on record
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deutsche Bank saw its credit-default swaps climb, its debt rating downgraded and some clients step back from working with it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Credit Suisse doesn’t face any one issue on the scale of Deutsche Bank’s $7.2 billion settlement, and its key capital ratio of 13.5% is higher than the 10.8% that the German firm had six years ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stress Deutsche Bank faced in 2016 resulted in the unusual dynamic where the cost of insuring against losses on the lender’s debt for one year surpassed that of protection for five years
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Truss, and her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, announced a new "growth plan" on Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                23 that would cut taxes and regulation, funded by vast government borrowing to snap the economy out of years of stagnant growth
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the plan triggered a crisis of investor confidence in the government, hammering the value of the pound and government bond prices and jolting global markets to such an extent that the Bank of England had to intervene with a 65 billion pound ($73 billion) programme to shore up the markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the removal of the top rate of tax only made up around 2 billion out of a 45 billion pound tax-cutting plan, it was the most eye-catching element of a fiscal package that was to be funded by government borrowing, with Kwarteng not explaining how it would be paid for in the long-term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision to reverse course is likely to put Truss and Kwarteng under huge pressure, less than four weeks after they came to power
            </p>

                Kwarteng said he had not considered resigning

                Finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng said the decision had been taken with "humility and contrition", after some lawmakers reacted with fury to suggestions that public and welfare spending could be cut to fund tax cuts for the richest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Addressing the Conservative Party's annual conference where lawmakers and supporters had gathered, Kwarteng acknowledged the turbulence of the last week, but argued the government needed to press ahead with a new course to revive growth

            <p>
                No more distractions." Truss - elected as prime minister by party members but not the broader public - is seeking to jolt the economy out of its decade of stagnant growth with a 1980s-style plan to cut taxes and regulation, all funded by vast government borrowing

                Signalling a break with "Treasury orthodoxy", she and Kwarteng also fired the most senior official in the government's finance department and released the tax cut plan without accompanying forecasts on how much it would cost

                We just look incompetent now, too." Another party insider said the Conservative government, in power under different leaders for 12 years but with Truss as prime minister only since Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Less than a day after Truss went on BBC television to defend the policy, Kwarteng released a statement early on Tuesday to say he now accepted it had become a distraction

            <p>
                Truss won the race to replace him after vowing to reignite the economy

                But while defending her tax cut policy on Sunday, she was unable to rule out public spending cuts and restrictions on welfare payments to balance the books

                Constance, better known as Connie, was believed to be in her 70s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Constance's old friend and fellow radio announcer Patrick Teoh announced the news of her death on his Facebook page Monday (Oct 3)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Today, I woke up to the sad news that an old friend, colleague and former radio announcer, Connie Haslam, has departed for the big radio station in the sky
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Farewell Connie, and keep the music playing up there," wrote Teoh
            </p>
            
            <p>
                May her soul rest in peace." Facebook user Sunny Nah also wrote a tribute to Constance, describing her as an icon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Constance was known as one of the golden voices of radio and had opted out of service at age 45 after working for 26 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her glittering career, Constance had interviewed Gloria Estafan, Dionne Warwick, Jose Feliciano, Bjorn Borg, the Bee Gees and Omar Sharif
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For most of us over a certain age, our growing-up years would have been touched by the dulcet tones of Constance Haslam; cheerful and chirpy while delivering request programmes, professional and informative when delivering the news, and warm and friendly during chat shows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Hers was the voice you’d like to wake up to or have as a soothing companion during the daily battle with the traffic to work," Kak Teh wrote in her blog post

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 3 — The reason many areas that supposedly should have 5G internet connection still haven't is because the telecommunication companies are not playing ball with the government, Deputy Minister of Communications and Multimedia Datuk Zahidi Zainul Abidin said today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "First and foremost, please inform the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) if your area has poor internet access
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We at the MCMC give the money to build these transmission stations using government and taxpayers money but the telcos are in charge of fastening the transmitters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We at MCMC can only ask them or implore them to place these transmitters to increase the strength of the transmitters while DNB don't have the authority to force them or reprimand them for not doing so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He encouraged the public to report their poor internet connection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said boosting internet signals to rural areas will cost a lot of money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However this costs money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We can take money from the SB (statutory bodies) fund or state government money as they have their own multimedia agencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The contention over 5G rollout in the country began when the government decided to create DNB, a special purpose vehicle to roll out the network in the country under a single wholesale network model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After much objection from the telcos who proposed a dual wholesale network to counter the single wholesale network, the government decided to offer a 70 per cent stake in DNB to the players while keeping 30 per cent and holding a golden share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The deal to take up a stake in DNB also requires shareholders to be 5G access seekers — they must also buy 5G capacity from DNB — with Tengku Zafrul also saying that foreign players were "knocking on our doors" to participate.

                The MACC chief commissioner said the number of corruption cases with women as the perpetrators was on the rise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When I first joined the organisation, which was then known as BPR (Badan Pencegah Rasuah), there was hardly a woman arrested for corruption in a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Corruption is about people who have power, the people who are given the trust and responsibility, ” he said in an interview here recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MACC was established on Oct 1, 1967

            <p>
                Therefore, it is not a crime for politicians and political parties to accept political funding and donations, he said, adding that they could accept political donations from corporations or individuals, provided the money is not from unlawful sources

            <p>
                The MACC chief commissioner said the number of corruption cases with women as the perpetrators was on the rise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When I first joined the organisation, which was then known as BPR (Badan Pencegah Rasuah), there was hardly a woman arrested for corruption in a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Corruption is about people who have power, the people who are given the trust and responsibility, ” he said in an interview here recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The MACC was established on Oct 1, 1967

                KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 -- Members of Parliament voted for the Constitution (Amendment) Bill (No
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among others, the MOU outlined an anti-party hopping law and that Parliament was not to be dissolved before that date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A prior constitutional amendment in July 2019 which was also unanimously passed in Parliament saw the lowering of the minimum voting age to 18 from 21, as well as allowing for automatic voter registration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The law, which has been gazetted and in force since Dec 15 last year, will allow 21.2million Malaysians to vote in GE15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A total of 29 new bills have been passed by the House, which included the long-awaited Anti-Sexual Harassment Bill, which will allow victims of sexual harassment (verbal, non-verbal, visual, gestural or physical) to report the harassment and have their case heard in a closed-door tribunal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s ahead Friday’s tabling of Budget 2023 will be a key focus of Parliament, along with the tabling of the Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022, which seeks to prohibit those born on and after Jan 1, 2007, from purchasing or possessing cigarettes or vape products
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said he was confident that the Bill, which is still being reviewed and studied by a Parliamentary Select Committee, will receive the support of the majority of MPs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 2, the Dewan Rakyat agreed that the Tobacco Product and Smoking Control Bill 2022 be referred to a Parliamentary Select Committee to examine and make recommendations for improvement, when the Bill was in its second reading
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bill was deemed by some MPs to be limiting freedom of choice after it was tabled in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Bill is among eight bills that have been tabled for its first reading in Parliament this year

                However, this time around, everyone will be keenly watching out for what may come immediately after the tabling of the Budget – the dissolution of the Parliament
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysians, say political observers, are looking forward to seeing what is in store for them and what the coalition government under Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob has got to offer in Budget 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is perhaps the first time that there are people who are more interested in waiting for the Prime Minister’s Parliament dissolution announcement than the Budget itself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the Parliament website, the Supply (Budget) Bill 2023 will be tabled by Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz at 4pm this Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If everything goes on to plan, Budget 2023 will then be approved by Dewan Rakyat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I do not want a ‘miscarriage’ of the Budget that will only be tabled and then for the Parliament to be immediately dissolved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Then, we will have to re-table it again by the new government after the 15th General Election,” he said, predicting the Budget 2023 to be full of “election goodies”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the tabling of the Budget is one of the most significant events of the year for the Parliament – without which there will be no money to run the government or the country – this meeting is also chock-full of other important Bills, such as the Anti-Stalking Bill, which women activists have fought for, as well as the Control of Tobacco Products and Smoking Bill 2022, also known as the Generation End Game Bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was after the contentious Bill, which was supposed to be passed in the last meeting, was referred to the committee on Aug 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Others slotted for a first reading are the Road Transport Bill (Amendments) 2022, Land Public Transport Bill (Amendments) 2022 and the Vehicle Trade Licensing Board (Amendments) 2022 Bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also on the table is the motion for the election of a Deputy Speaker for the Dewan Rakyat to replace Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said, which has been postponed for the fourth time

            <p>
                Malaysians, say political observers, are looking forward to seeing what is in store for them and what the coalition government under Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob has got to offer in Budget 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is perhaps the first time that there are people who are more interested in waiting for the Prime Minister’s Parliament dissolution announcement than the Budget itself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the Parliament website, the Supply (Budget) Bill 2023 will be tabled by Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz at 4pm this Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If everything goes on to plan, Budget 2023 will then be approved by Dewan Rakyat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I do not want a ‘miscarriage’ of the Budget that will only be tabled and then for the Parliament to be immediately dissolved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Then, we will have to re-table it again by the new government after the 15th General Election,” he said, predicting the Budget 2023 to be full of “election goodies”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the tabling of the Budget is one of the most significant events of the year for the Parliament – without which there will be no money to run the government or the country – this meeting is also chock-full of other important Bills, such as the Anti-Stalking Bill, which women activists have fought for, as well as the Control of Tobacco Products and Smoking Bill 2022, also known as the Generation End Game Bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was after the contentious Bill, which was supposed to be passed in the last meeting, was referred to the committee on Aug 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Others slotted for a first reading are the Road Transport Bill (Amendments) 2022, Land Public Transport Bill (Amendments) 2022 and the Vehicle Trade Licensing Board (Amendments) 2022 Bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also on the table is the motion for the election of a Deputy Speaker for the Dewan Rakyat to replace Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said, which has been postponed for the fourth time
            </p>

                In Naples, Koulibaly was known for his explosive physical strength but it was used in conjunction with strong tactical intelligence.  Kim Min-jae has been a huge success since joining Napoli in the summer from Fenerbahce By contrast, Kim seems to prefer direct aggression - and it's working too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Koulibaly is certainly among the strongest defenders in the world and will be remembered as a Napoli icon but Kim looks set to be even more useful to the Italian side.  Kim uses all the dark arts a defender can use during a game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His aggressive form of defending has already rattled Premier League sides including Liverpool Kim's physical strength has been key in helping Napoli lead Serie A in the early stages this term Standing at 190cm and about 88kg, moving Kim is like trying to shift Mount Vesuvius
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his giant physique and aggressive nature, Kim appears to stick to the rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim is inspired by Sergio Ramos and Fabio Cannavaro but soon dreams of inheriting the leadership of Koulibaly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim though has not allowed such a move to hinder his game - he appears to now thrive on the pressure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim is focused precisely on his career and his move from Fenerbahce underlines his desire to become an elite player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rival clubs could soon be showing interest in Kim though as in his 40-page contract there is a €50m (£44m) release clause
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Considering his physical attributes, Kim would be the ideal player in any top international club but would probably be perfectly at home in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United have shown interest in Kim, who has been compared to club captain Harry Maguire in terms of his strength but of having greater concentration Kim signed a contract of three years plus another 24 months on top as an option to Napoli
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim has the physique of Harry Maguire but compared to the English defender he has exceptional concentration which makes him difficult to overcome

                In Naples, Koulibaly was known for his explosive physical strength but it was used in conjunction with strong tactical intelligence.  Kim Min-jae has been a huge success since joining Napoli in the summer from Fenerbahce By contrast, Kim seems to prefer direct aggression - and it's working too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Koulibaly is certainly among the strongest defenders in the world and will be remembered as a Napoli icon but Kim looks set to be even more useful to the Italian side.  Kim uses all the dark arts a defender can use during a game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His aggressive form of defending has already rattled Premier League sides including Liverpool Kim's physical strength has been key in helping Napoli lead Serie A in the early stages this term Standing at 190cm and about 88kg, moving Kim is like trying to shift Mount Vesuvius
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite his giant physique and aggressive nature, Kim appears to stick to the rules
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim is inspired by Sergio Ramos and Fabio Cannavaro but soon dreams of inheriting the leadership of Koulibaly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim though has not allowed such a move to hinder his game - he appears to now thrive on the pressure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim is focused precisely on his career and his move from Fenerbahce underlines his desire to become an elite player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rival clubs could soon be showing interest in Kim though as in his 40-page contract there is a €50m (£44m) release clause
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Considering his physical attributes, Kim would be the ideal player in any top international club but would probably be perfectly at home in the Premier League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Manchester United have shown interest in Kim, who has been compared to club captain Harry Maguire in terms of his strength but of having greater concentration Kim signed a contract of three years plus another 24 months on top as an option to Napoli
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kim has the physique of Harry Maguire but compared to the English defender he has exceptional concentration which makes him difficult to overcome
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                “She can also avoid playing in the qualifying rounds.” Jin Wei is ranked 50th in the world

            <p>
                The two-time world junior champion will take a one-week break before returning to two competitions – Indonesia International (Oct 11-16) and the Indonesia Masters (Oct 18-23) in Malang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jin Wei has not won any major title although she had reigned as the country’s best before she was affected by her stomach ailment in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, Jin Wei will have to continue her career without an international title but Nova expects it to change soon

                The US is intent on rebuilding its own semiconductor industry and denying China technology with advanced military or other national security-related applications – the first and prime example being Huawei’s telecom equipment

            <p>
                It’s also been reported that China couldn’t make semiconductors at all without production equipment from America’s Applied Materials and Lam Research or inspection equipment from the California-based KLA
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China is a rival and has been ever since the US took the side of the Nationalists in China’s civil war

            <p>

                The US is intent on rebuilding its own semiconductor industry and denying China technology with advanced military or other national security-related applications – the first and prime example being Huawei’s telecom equipment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So what can China do about America’s sanctions and bans? It has been widely reported that China cannot make leading-edge semiconductor devices without EUV lithography equipment from ASML of the Netherlands and electronic design automation (EDA) tools from Synopsis and Cadence of America or Siemens (Mentor Graphics) of Germany
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s also been reported that China couldn’t make semiconductors at all without production equipment from America’s Applied Materials and Lam Research or inspection equipment from the California-based KLA

            <p>
                China is a rival and has been ever since the US took the side of the Nationalists in China’s civil war

            <p>
                For China, that means double down on industrial policies to develop advanced technologies

            <p>
                The Corolla and Corolla Touring both share the same face as the Levin sold in China (we get the European look in Malaysia), and this has been tweaked so the large lower intake no longer has a honeycomb insert

                As for the Corolla Sport, which matches the hatchback European and United States customers get, it receives a more expressive front apron with more prominent fog lamp surrounds as well as an arrow-themed insert for its lower intake

            <p>
                The hybrid powertrain comes with an e-CVT to send drive to the front wheels, although the Corolla and Corolla Touring can also be had with the E-Four all-wheel drive system that adds a rear 1WM electric motor with 41 PS and 84 Nm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition to the revised hybrid powertrain, the Corolla and Corolla Touring also receive a new 1.5 litre Dynamic Force naturally-aspirated three-cylinder petrol engine to replace the previous 2ZR-FAE 1.8 litre NA four-cylinder unit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To go along with the Dynamic Force engine, the Super CVT-i has been replaced with a Toyota’s Direct Shift-CVT
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the Corolla Sport also gets a Dynamic Force engine to replace the previous 8NR-FTS 1.2 litre turbocharged four-pot (116 PS and 185 Nm)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Corolla retails for between 1.99 and 2.998 million yen (RM63,756 and RM96,050) in Japan, while the Corolla Touring is from 2.07 to 3.048 million yen (RM66,319 to RM97,652) and the Corolla Sport is priced between 2.2 and 2.89 million yen (RM70,485 and RM92,592)

                The hybrid powertrain comes with an e-CVT to send drive to the front wheels, although the Corolla and Corolla Touring can also be had with the E-Four all-wheel drive system that adds a rear 1WM electric motor with 41 PS and 84 Nm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition to the revised hybrid powertrain, the Corolla and Corolla Touring also receive a new 1.5 litre Dynamic Force naturally-aspirated three-cylinder petrol engine to replace the previous 2ZR-FAE 1.8 litre NA four-cylinder unit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To go along with the Dynamic Force engine, the Super CVT-i has been replaced with a Toyota’s Direct Shift-CVT
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the Corolla Sport also gets a Dynamic Force engine to replace the previous 8NR-FTS 1.2 litre turbocharged four-pot (116 PS and 185 Nm)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Corolla retails for between 1.99 and 2.998 million yen (RM63,756 and RM96,050) in Japan, while the Corolla Touring is from 2.07 to 3.048 million yen (RM66,319 to RM97,652) and the Corolla Sport is priced between 2.2 and 2.89 million yen (RM70,485 and RM92,592)

                The recent reopening of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan is likely to further increase year-end flights
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Already, the recent reopening of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan is likely to further increase year-end flights, as airlines respond to demand from Asian travellers, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pre-Covid-19, China accounted for about 20 per cent of Singapore's tourists
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We plan with the capacity in mind, but we also need to be vigilant." He was responding to questions from Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC) and Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC), who were concerned about Changi Airport's capacity to handle higher year-end flight volumes during the winter season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saktiandi was also worried that the authorities might have over-budgeted when it set the target for 80 per cent of pre-Covid-19 flights by the year end
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mr Iswaran said there is predictability to these figures, which are derived from airlines when they submit to Changi Airport for flight slots that they operate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had said previously that the sector wanted to hire another 4,000 people by the year end, restoring manpower to 90 per cent of 2019 levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From Oct 30, there will be an additional daily service to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport, bringing the number of flights SIA operates daily to Japan’s capital to four
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will also be a second daily flight to Osaka

                This comes after the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, EP Blueshark had received approval by the road transport department (JPJ) for the licensing and registration of its electric two-wheeler products, which itself followed the conditional approval for the construction of its first manufacturing plant in Malaysia

                The approval from MITI was granted under the Industrial Coordination Act 1975, and has been applied retrospectively from July 25, 2022, the company said

                Many researchers are advocating for and urging the government to impose foreign exchange (forex) controls, that is pegging the ringgit to the US dollar, to mitigate the current and expected decline in the value of the ringgit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Is this the right move? First of all, we have to realise that the currency depreciation is not unique to Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Secondly, exchange rate controls would mean intervention in the forex market to defend the ringgit and this will come at a hefty price to the country’s foreign exchange reserves (see chart)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the exchange rate is fixed as proposed, the country is likely to experience a drop in competitiveness due to external shocks, which will affect its reserves
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Studies have also shown that a fixed exchange rate is unsustainable when there is an unexpected increase in government spending
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Broadly speaking, a currency contagion or spillover can happen in the short, or medium to long term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The short-term drivers of currency contagion are often associated with market sentiments, financial panic and herding behaviour, as Keynes (1970) famously said, “It is better to have failed conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.” The medium to long-term currency contagion or spillover is usually driven by trade and financial linkages, external shocks and similarities in macroeconomic vulnerability indicators to the country of shock origin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What is needed in the long term is a buffer against the exchange rate shocks by strengthening the fundamentals of the country, which goes beyond the traditional growth and macroeconomic indicators
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the results are not expected to be immediate, it is necessary to ensure the future competitiveness of our country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The policy focus should not be on controlling the exchange rate or implementing a pegged exchange rate regime
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ringgit is expected to rebound and we will experience stronger long-term trends if we can strengthen our economic fundamentals

                The assistant to the director of a hospitality company in Reading said he had wired all his money to the UK in 2019 at an average exchange rate of HK$10.71 with the pound
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But, although the pound’s crisis left some Hongkongers faced with a financial loss, others have benefited from a more favourable exchange rate with the Japanese yen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jeffrey Leung, 40, who owns a skiing school based in Niseko, Hokkaido, seized the chance in late August to buy 20 million yen (US$138,220) through a broker at an average exchange rate of HK$1 to 17 yen because he wanted to expand his business
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The exchange rate for the yen was HK$1 to 18.4288 yen on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                The further slide in yen doesn’t really matter to me and my business partners,” Leung said, emphasising they were not speculating for profit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said he had spent HK$30,000 to buy yen for the trip a few days ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The exchange rate is really alluring, even though the package is more expensive than the period before the pandemic hit

            <p>
                Gabriel Leung Wai-chun, director of the Birdy Exchange Company in Hong Kong, said he had noticed more customers buying yen for travel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They’ve been longing to travel and took advantage of a very low currency rate,” Leung said

            <p>
                “We are seeing Hong Kong investors that are gradually accumulating to benefit from favourable exchange rates.” Casanova added most people that had bought the yen and British currency were people who wanted to travel or relocate and were not speculators

                All in all, next year could shape up to be a bumper year for tourism in Asia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan has announced that it will reopen to all international visitors, allowing individual travel for tourism purposes to restart from October 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thailand, meanwhile, has ended its state of emergency in relation to Covid-19 and, as of October 1, it will no longer be necessary to present proof of vaccination or a negative test upon arrival to enter the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Vietnam, the visa waiver for stays of less than 15 days is once again valid, and a Covid test is no longer mandatory upon arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, in Hong Kong, foreign visitors are no longer required to quarantine on arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, the big hitters of the Asian tourism scene are gearing up to welcome back their visitors after two and a half years of pandemic
            </p>

                All in all, next year could shape up to be a bumper year for tourism in Asia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Japan has announced that it will reopen to all international visitors, allowing individual travel for tourism purposes to restart from October 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thailand, meanwhile, has ended its state of emergency in relation to Covid-19 and, as of October 1, it will no longer be necessary to present proof of vaccination or a negative test upon arrival to enter the country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Vietnam, the visa waiver for stays of less than 15 days is once again valid, and a Covid test is no longer mandatory upon arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Similarly, in Hong Kong, foreign visitors are no longer required to quarantine on arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In short, the big hitters of the Asian tourism scene are gearing up to welcome back their visitors after two and a half years of pandemic

                And it really goes back to this idea that after 25 years of quiescent inflation, we had a breakout in the readings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s now been over a year and obviously really feeding into the Fed’s imperative to get inflation under control by going on this unprecedented degree of hiking

            <p>
                Because it was clear the policy mismatch between the new Truss government and Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and where the Bank of England felt it needs to go -- needed to go, needs to go, and that’s an open concept, which is why I keep changing tenses -- is that it’s really caused this instability that got some feeling as if there was this idea that the UK was about to become an emerging market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That type of volatility

            <p>
                Basically from our point of view, these kinds of bear markets -- and if you go back to the highs in January -- they don’t move in straight lines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The psychology tends to be poor in every September, but particularly so this year because you have all this macro uncertainty and a Fed who’s committed to hiking rates and keeping pressure really on the rest of the world via the stronger dollar through the rate-hike transmission mechanism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The VIX has started spiking, you’ve seen investor sentiment that’s really only as bad as it’s ever been near the trough in 2009, and near the bottom of the first Gulf War bear market in 1990

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because it was clear the policy mismatch between the new Truss government and Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and where the Bank of England felt it needs to go -- needed to go, needs to go, and that’s an open concept, which is why I keep changing tenses -- is that it’s really caused this instability that got some feeling as if there was this idea that the UK was about to become an emerging market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That type of volatility
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Basically from our point of view, these kinds of bear markets -- and if you go back to the highs in January -- they don’t move in straight lines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The psychology tends to be poor in every September, but particularly so this year because you have all this macro uncertainty and a Fed who’s committed to hiking rates and keeping pressure really on the rest of the world via the stronger dollar through the rate-hike transmission mechanism
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The VIX has started spiking, you’ve seen investor sentiment that’s really only as bad as it’s ever been near the trough in 2009, and near the bottom of the first Gulf War bear market in 1990

                Datuk Seri Siti Nurhaliza shared the stage with South Korean heartthrob Lee Min-ho at a concert in Kuala Lumpur last night (Oct 1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Being a fan of Lee, Siti wanted a selfie with the Pachinko star but photo with him was not allowed unless taken by an official photographer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "But once I was on stage (with Lee) I wasn't going to let go of the golden opportunity to take a selfie with him," Siti wrote in an Instagram post today (Oct 2)

            <p>
                Armed with courage and a mobile phone in hand, the resourceful singer asked KC Hoe, the founder and CEO of Cuckoo – who was also on stage – if she could get a selfie with Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And so did Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mission accomplished!" wrote Siti who posted several photos and a video of her encounter with Lee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Star's Malay-language portal, mStar reported that Lee told media backstage that he was happy to be back in Malaysia

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, October 2 — Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s (Bersatu) Youth Chief Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal today labelled Umno President Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi as a “lunatic” and “anti-science” person for continuously calling for the 15th general election (GE15) to be held soon despite the monsoon season warning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This Umno is mad

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He is mad and he is also anti-science, because the environment minister (Environment and Water Minister Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man), our Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim said that the meteorological department already said that when November comes, there will be a monsoon transition and like the previous year, the flood that hit our country is not the same like in the previous years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whoever does not understand scientific knowledge, they are surely stupid when it comes to understanding the flood this time around

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her speech earlier, Bersatu’s Srikandi Wing chief, Datuk Seri Rina Mohd Harun also chastised those pushing for GE15 to be held soonest, adding that it would affect the efforts of the government which has already gazetted many schools as flood relief centres
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the Women, Family and Community Development Minister, 6,010 temporary flood evacuation centres have been identified for flood victims, nationwide
            </p>

                So, which one is it? Should we make it into temporary flood evacuation centres for flood victims or make it into places for us to cast our votes? Please comment,” she said, adding that while Bersatu is not afraid of the polls, it has to think of the plight of those who will be affected by the floods

                The Fed’s policy rate is now in the 3.00%-3.25% range, a full 3 percentage points higher than where it was at the start of 2022, and officials have penciled in more rate rises later this year and in 2023

                About Us Advertise MALANG, Oct 2 — At least 174 people died at an Indonesian football stadium when thousands of angry home fans invaded the pitch and police responded with tear gas that triggered a stampede, authorities said Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I deeply regret this tragedy and I hope this football tragedy will be the last in our country,” Widodo said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Images taken from inside the stadium during the stampede showed police firing huge amounts of tear gas and people clambering over fences
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “People were pushing each other and..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My eyes were burning because of the tear gas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stadium holds 42,000 people and authorities said it was a sell-out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police said 3,000 people stormed the pitch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On why police used tear gas inside the stadium, he said they “had to take some measures to anticipate” spectators entering the pitch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang is not included in that list
            </p>

                About Us Advertise MALANG, Oct 2 — At least 174 people died at an Indonesian football stadium when thousands of angry home fans invaded the pitch and police responded with tear gas that triggered a stampede, authorities said Sunday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I deeply regret this tragedy and I hope this football tragedy will be the last in our country,” Widodo said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Images taken from inside the stadium during the stampede showed police firing huge amounts of tear gas and people clambering over fences
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “People were pushing each other and..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My eyes were burning because of the tear gas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stadium holds 42,000 people and authorities said it was a sell-out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Police said 3,000 people stormed the pitch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On why police used tear gas inside the stadium, he said they “had to take some measures to anticipate” spectators entering the pitch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang is not included in that list

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 2 — It may have only been a five-sen change for some, but local coffee chain retailer ZUS Coffee has come under social media users for their dismissive response
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was surprised when the cashier told him that they were out of five sen coins and proceeded to only give him a 20 sen change instead — five sen short of the change he should have received
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fdaus then responded to the cashier saying that he should’ve received 30 sen instead of 20 sen as the coffee shop was the one who was short on change
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No, I’m not trying to be fussy, but the issue here is not about the five sen, 50 sen or RM50 value — it’s more on the gentleman principle between a seller and a customer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Imagine if I paid RM11.70 for the RM11.75 coffee and just simply said sorry and told you that I’m five sen short, how would you feel?” Fdaus wrote in the post
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cashier then proceeded to give him an additional 10 sen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following Fdaus’ post, ZUS Coffee chief operating officer Venon Tian apologised for the incident and released a detailed statement regarding the five sen fiasco on ZUS Coffee’s social media yesterday after conducting an immediate investigation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to the statement, on September 30, ZUS Coffee had acknowledged Fdaus’s post and had introduced a new 75 sen off voucher code for the inconveniences they caused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How many times you didn’t return the 5 sen to any customers? And yet you still had the audacity to mock us with the 75 sen token
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I am not that good in English, but writing “a mere five sen” for me is just like sorry but not sorry

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 2 — It may have only been a five-sen change for some, but local coffee chain retailer ZUS Coffee has come under social media users for their dismissive response
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was surprised when the cashier told him that they were out of five sen coins and proceeded to only give him a 20 sen change instead — five sen short of the change he should have received
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fdaus then responded to the cashier saying that he should’ve received 30 sen instead of 20 sen as the coffee shop was the one who was short on change
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No, I’m not trying to be fussy, but the issue here is not about the five sen, 50 sen or RM50 value — it’s more on the gentleman principle between a seller and a customer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Imagine if I paid RM11.70 for the RM11.75 coffee and just simply said sorry and told you that I’m five sen short, how would you feel?” Fdaus wrote in the post
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cashier then proceeded to give him an additional 10 sen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following Fdaus’ post, ZUS Coffee chief operating officer Venon Tian apologised for the incident and released a detailed statement regarding the five sen fiasco on ZUS Coffee’s social media yesterday after conducting an immediate investigation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to the statement, on September 30, ZUS Coffee had acknowledged Fdaus’s post and had introduced a new 75 sen off voucher code for the inconveniences they caused
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How many times you didn’t return the 5 sen to any customers? And yet you still had the audacity to mock us with the 75 sen token
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I am not that good in English, but writing “a mere five sen” for me is just like sorry but not sorry

            <p>
                Ukraine forces have liberated the small Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka settlements in the Kherson region as well, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ukraine's Interfax agency reported that according to Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesman for the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces, Ukraine's forces recaptured Torske, a small village in the Donetsk region, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) east of the now liberated Lyman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday that it was pulling troops out of the Lyman area "in connection with the creation of a threat of encirclement"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It did not mention Lyman in its daily update on fighting in Ukraine on Sunday, although it said Russian forces had destroyed seven artillery and missile depots in the Ukrainian regions of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Donetsk

            <p>
                Zelenskiy said the abduction of the director-general of Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is an act of Russian terror
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Ukrainian military said in its evening statement on Sunday that its forces had repelled Russian advances in several areas - particularly in Donetsk region near Bakhmut and Spirne, just inside Donetsk region near Lysychansk, a major centre in neighbouring Luhansk region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russian forces had captured Lyman from Ukraine in May and had been using it as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia's largest battlefield loss since Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region in September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia had 5,000 to 5,500 troops in the town before the Ukrainian attack, a Ukrainian military spokesman said on Saturday

                The capture on Saturday came just a day after Putin proclaimed the annexation of nearly a fifth of Ukraine - including Donetsk, where Lyman is located - and placed the regions under Russia's nuclear umbrella

                LOGISTICS HUB Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern forces, said before the capture that Russia had 5,000 to 5,500 troops at Lyman but the number encircled could be lower

            </p>
            
            <p>
                So it presents a sort of a dilemma for the Russians going forward." Austin did not say whether he thought Ukraine's capture of Lyman might prompt Russian escalation, although U.S

                officials have widely denounced Russia's nuclear rhetoric in recent days and President Joe Biden has publicly urged Putin not to use nuclear weapons

                Ukraine's successes have infuriated Putin's allies such as Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's southern Chechnya region

            <p>
                LOGISTICS HUB Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern forces, said before the capture that Russia had 5,000 to 5,500 troops at Lyman but the number encircled could be lower

                "The liberation of this city in the Donetsk region is one of the key factors for the further de-occupation of the Luhansk region," Gaidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday

                The areas Putin claimed as Russian - the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - form a swath of territory equal to about 18% of Ukraine's total surface land area

                The stinging setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin was delivered after he proclaimed the annexation of four regions covering nearly a fifth of Ukraine on Friday, an area that includes Lyman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday that it was pulling troops out of the Lyman area "in connection with the creation of a threat of encirclement"

            <p>
                It did not mention Lyman in its daily update on fighting in Ukraine on Sunday, although it said Russian forces had destroyed seven artillery and missile depots in the Ukrainian regions of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Donetsk

            <p>
                Zelenskiy said the abduction of the director-general of Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is an act of Russian terror
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Ukrainian military said in its evening statement on Sunday that its forces had repelled Russian advances in several areas - particularly in Donetsk region near Bakhmut and Spirne, just inside Donetsk region near Lysychansk, a major centre in neighbouring Luhansk region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russian forces had captured Lyman from Ukraine in May and had been using it as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia's largest battlefield loss since Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region in September

                Manchester United's fortunes 'changed once Erik ten Hag built a four-man leadership group' By naming Maguire as a key leader, it seems Ten Hag is still heavily relying on the centre-back's experience and attitude at Old Trafford, despite axing him from United's starting line-up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has also fostered a 'no d**kheads' rule in the transfer market in the hope of improving Manchester United's culture off the pitch, according to the Telegraph
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Dutchman has trusted both Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes to be leaders at the club Goalkeepers Tom Heaton (L) and David de Gea (R) are also part of Ten Hag's leadership group The Red Devils' dressing room has seemed somewhat disjointed and dysfunctional in recent campaigns, but Ten Hag is working hard to instill a positivity and togetherness at Old Trafford
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 52-year-old coach faces his toughest challenge to date on Sunday as Manchester United travel to the Etihad to take on defending champions and bitter rivals Manchester City
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pep Guardiola's side did the double over United last campaign, winning 2-0 at Old Trafford last November before carving out a 4-1 thrashing in March

                Manchester United's fortunes 'changed once Erik ten Hag built a four-man leadership group' By naming Maguire as a key leader, it seems Ten Hag is still heavily relying on the centre-back's experience and attitude at Old Trafford, despite axing him from United's starting line-up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag has also fostered a 'no d**kheads' rule in the transfer market in the hope of improving Manchester United's culture off the pitch, according to the Telegraph
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Dutchman has trusted both Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes to be leaders at the club Goalkeepers Tom Heaton (L) and David de Gea (R) are also part of Ten Hag's leadership group The Red Devils' dressing room has seemed somewhat disjointed and dysfunctional in recent campaigns, but Ten Hag is working hard to instill a positivity and togetherness at Old Trafford

                Pep Guardiola's side did the double over United last campaign, winning 2-0 at Old Trafford last November before carving out a 4-1 thrashing in March

                Ismail Sabri, who is also an Umno vice-president, said he had reached a consensus as one of the top five of the leadership on Friday as there was a need to return the mandate to the people as soon as possible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We (Umno top five) have always stated that there is a need to hasten the general election as we want to return the mandate to the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will have the Umno top five meeting, the political bureau meeting and the supreme council meeting before we decide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If there is a good reason to hold the snap polls, we will agree to it – that has always been our stand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As for the date (of dissolution of Parliament), please wait
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You have waited since last year, you can wait a little while more this year,” said Ismail Sabri
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 30, the Umno supreme council stated that the Prime Minister would be meeting the Yang di-Pertuan Agong soon to advise on the date for dissolving Parliament this year to pave the way for the next general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This came after months of insistence by Umno leaders led by party president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to hold snap polls, despite reasoning by those supporting Ismail Sabri that it would be unwise to hold the elections during the monsoon season due to floods
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan released a statement on Friday that the dissolution of Parliament must be made as soon as possible to allow the 15th General Election to be held by this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision made by the Umno supreme council, he said, was consistent with the party’s stand from the beginning to return the mandate to Malaysians after the fall of the Pakatan Harapan government in February 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Umno supreme council had also instructed the entire party machinery to finalise all electoral preparations

                Supreme council members who attended the meeting, but who declined to be named, said that Tajuddin and Yusof were suspected of going against the top Umno leadership

                FAA’s assessment covers CAAM’s role as an aviation regulator, and is not an assessment of Malaysian airlines or airports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are very pleased to share that today (yesterday), FAA has officially announced that Malaysia has regained Category 1 of the International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) rating, and for this extremely proud achievement, I applaud everyone at CAAM for their tireless effort and commitment to this success,” said Dr Wee, who kickstarted the transformation process in CAAM after he assumed the role of Transport Minister in March 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As part of the change, Dr Wee brought in Tan Sri Mohd Khairul Adib Abd Rahman, the former director-general of public service, to be CAAM chairman, and career pilot Datuk Capt Chester Voo, to be CEO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In November 2019, FAA announced that Malaysia was assigned a Category 2 rating under the IASA programme due to non-compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) safety standards after a reassessment of CAAM earlier that year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The FAA assessment in 2019 found that CAAM needs to address 58 findings, whereby CAAM was able to resolve 25 of them in a relatively short time, while 33 other findings took much longer to resolve,” said Dr Wee, who gave a press conference yesterday in Montreal, the headquarters of ICAO, where he is attending the ICAO general assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Capt Voo, who was among the delegation, expressed his gratitude to the ministry and the FAA for their support in CAAM’s reinstatement as a Category 1 regulator
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There were 301 questions from the FAA audit that required 403 critical element responses, and I would like to express my gratitude to the FAA for its very instructive and very detailed efforts to achieve the best in safety for the civil aviation industry
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This has shown Malaysia is compliant and has now demonstrated that we have an effective safety oversight capability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On behalf of all of our team, I would like to commit to all that we will be facilitating an inclusive aviation industry with no compromise on safety,” said Capt Voo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among others, the Malaysian delegation included Khairul Adib, Transport Ministry’s secretary-general Datuk Isham Ishak, Malaysian Aviation Commission executive chairman Datuk Seri Saripuddin Kasim, Malaysia Aviation Group CEO Capt Izham Ismail, AirAsia Malaysia CEO Riad Asmat, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd managing director Datuk Iskandar Mizal Mahmood and Batik Air CEO Capt Mushafiz Mustafa Bakri

            <p>
                Malaysia’s participation as an ICAO council member enables the country to contribute to the international civil aviation industry and provides an avenue to voice matters affecting national interest, while also raising the country’s standing at the global level

            <p>
                About Us Advertise GEORGE TOWN, Oct 2 — Budget 2023 would have no legality if Parliament were to be dissolved before it could be approved as rumoured, constitutional lawyers explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Surendra explained that the same Bill could be tabled again in order for it to proceed to the second reading when debate could take place, or a new one submitted entirely
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either scenario could lead to significant delays in passing Budget 2023 as both would have to wait until the 15th Parliament is sworn in, which could be weeks or months after the general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tabling of Budget 2023 has been expedited by three weeks to October 7 this year, fuelling suspicion that this was to allow for a general election to be held almost immediately after
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These circumstances then fuelled rumours that the prime minister would advise the Yang di Pertuan Agong to dissolve Parliament immediately or shortly after the tabling of Budget 2023, reminiscent to events before the 1999 general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 1999, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who was the prime minister at the time, sought the dissolution of Parliament shortly after the tabling of Budget 2000 in November, and his finance minister was forced to table another one at the end of February 2000 or around three months later, after Barisan Nasional prevailed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former finance minister Lim Guan Eng said this would also be the case if Parliament were dissolved before Budget 2023 could be approved, which effectively meant the document would little more than a draft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There is a necessity for an economic reform for the country and for the budget to prioritise the people’s needs,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Budget should be taking care of the people’s needs,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finance Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz is set to table Budget 2023 on October 7, three weeks earlier than initially scheduled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Azhar Azizan Harun reportedly said the first reading of the Budget 2023 will be on October 5 and then it will be brought for the second reading on October 7

                About Us Advertise GEORGE TOWN, Oct 2 — Budget 2023 would have no legality if Parliament were to be dissolved before it could be approved as rumoured, constitutional lawyers explained
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Surendra explained that the same Bill could be tabled again in order for it to proceed to the second reading when debate could take place, or a new one submitted entirely
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either scenario could lead to significant delays in passing Budget 2023 as both would have to wait until the 15th Parliament is sworn in, which could be weeks or months after the general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tabling of Budget 2023 has been expedited by three weeks to October 7 this year, fuelling suspicion that this was to allow for a general election to be held almost immediately after
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These circumstances then fuelled rumours that the prime minister would advise the Yang di Pertuan Agong to dissolve Parliament immediately or shortly after the tabling of Budget 2023, reminiscent to events before the 1999 general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 1999, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who was the prime minister at the time, sought the dissolution of Parliament shortly after the tabling of Budget 2000 in November, and his finance minister was forced to table another one at the end of February 2000 or around three months later, after Barisan Nasional prevailed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former finance minister Lim Guan Eng said this would also be the case if Parliament were dissolved before Budget 2023 could be approved, which effectively meant the document would little more than a draft
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “There is a necessity for an economic reform for the country and for the budget to prioritise the people’s needs,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The Budget should be taking care of the people’s needs,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finance Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz is set to table Budget 2023 on October 7, three weeks earlier than initially scheduled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Azhar Azizan Harun reportedly said the first reading of the Budget 2023 will be on October 5 and then it will be brought for the second reading on October 7

                The interest rate on those loans could surge to 7.54% in the new year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So all those payments take away from your retirement income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While these credit card balances should be paid down quickly, you shouldn’t let them delay saving for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, consider lowering your mortgage payments to use those funds to pay down other high interest loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finally, auto loans are another area to pay off before retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of August 2022, the average car loan for a buyer with good credit was 7.88%, according to MyAutoloan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if you have bad credit, that soars up to 19.87%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s about as much as the interest rate on a credit card

            <p>
                What’s more, you’ll have to take into consideration these payments for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If $400 goes into a car payment, and $300 to a credit card and more for student loans, suddenly you have far less cash on hand for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why not pay down your mortgage too? It’s not just lower interest rates, although with the average national mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed rate at about 6.5%, that is an advantage

                Speaking on TalkSPORT, the pundit laid into the Liverpool manager for his team selection against Brighton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, start Diaz, start Nunez
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Liverpool now are 11 points behind Arsenal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Teams are targeting that right-hand side with Trent and it’s hard to watch Liverpool defend

            <p>
                He’s played well for Liverpool so far and is deserving of a decent sized role in the team

            <p>
                Nevertheless, this was a big game for Liverpool

                As good as Carvalho is, or has the potential be, he isn’t currently in Liverpool’s strongest side

            <p>
                The decision to start Roberto Firmino over Nunez wasn’t a bad one, though
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Yet with investor sentiment in the gutter and the Bank of England vowing to open the chequebook to prop up its bond market, could another equities bear-market rally be in the cards? Julian Emanuel says so

                And it really goes back to this idea that after 25 years of quiescent inflation, we had a breakout in the readings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's now been over a year and obviously really feeding into the Fed's (US Federal Reserve) imperative to get inflation under control by going on this unprecedented degree of hiking

            <p>
                You've had a leadership change, the queen's passing, a new prime minister, a new government — just total huge challenges in a market that had already been showing strains, frankly, since the Brexit vote in 2016

            <p>
                So really, testing the outer bands of volatility across every asset that’s in the UK

                Liverpool will need to go as strong as they can

            <p>
                Between them, there is no point hurrying back Konaté, so Van Dijk and Matip will get the nod again

            <p>
                In the rush not to scapegoat Alexander-Arnold, many have inadvertently thrown Elliott under the bus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The newly-crowned Liverpool Player of the Month for September should not lose his place in midfield — Henderson can play in midweek
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alongside the youngster, Thiago and Fabinho will complete a strong trio

            <p>
                Salah is bound to play, and it would be good to get Núñez in the side if he is fit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In contrast, Salah scored a hat-trick and returned to Liverpool early so he is a must for me
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Diogo Jota is also in form and scored for Portugal while Darwin Núñez did the same for Uruguay in his last international game before returning to Liverpool, and so I would start the trio

                About Us Advertise     KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 1 ― The grade for primary school headmasters and senior assistants will be upgraded to the maximum DG54, announced Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move, he said, would benefit 2,047 education service officers nationwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said headmasters on Grade DG48 (personal to holder) also would no longer have to drop to senior assistants or ordinary teachers in primary schools once they have been promoted to Grades DG52 and DG54 on a time-based excellence basis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This will upgrade the substantive grades for the posts of headmaster and senior assistant teacher, as well as enable those who have been promoted to a higher grade to remain in that position until Grade DG54,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister said the issue of the grade for headmasters in primary schools only limited to Grade DG48 and senior assistants to Grade 44 was among issues raised by NUTP to him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri said the Education Ministry was also studying the staffing structure of headmasters and senior assistants in primary schools through the proposed School Model with the setting of flexi grades up to DG54 to safeguard the position of school administrators, while maintaining harmony among the school staff
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apart from that, Grade DG48 officers in the education service (PPP) will also be given the opportunity to be appointed as senior assistants in primary schools, he said, adding that this meant that senior assistants in primary schools would not be limited to Grade DG44 only
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said senior assistants who had been promoted to a higher grade could also remain in that post until Grade DG54
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Prime Minister also announced that the career path of Outstanding Teachers in primary schools will also be extended up to Grades DG52 and DG54 as 90.68 percent of primary school teachers were now graduate teachers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The government, he said, was also making efforts to address various issues plaguing the country's education, such as school maintenance and security, allowance of senior assistants that need to be reviewed and the shortage of teachers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the government was also concerned about the issue of dilapidated schools in Sabah and Sarawak and it would be given serious attention in the 2023 Budget which will be tabled this Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prime minister also called on parents to always cooperate with teachers and the school, who strived to ensure their children excel academically and also in co-curricular activities

                By Yasin Ebrahim                                Investing.com -- The Dow fell Friday, rounding off its worst quarterly losing streak since 2015 that has pushed stocks into bear-market territory as investors prepared for further Federal Reserve rate hikes to cool inflation that continues to run hot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7%, or 490 points, the Nasdaq was down 1.5%, and the S&P 500 fell 1.4%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All three major averages fell for the third straight quarter.  The personal consumption expenditure price index, the fed’s preferred inflation measure, showed that inflation rose more than expected in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This “compounds the pressure for the [Fed] to stay on course in its fight against inflation,” Stifel said in a note
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fed vice chair Lael Brainard on Friday cautioned against the central bank reversing course on monetary policy too early, saying monetary policy would need to be “restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target” After hiking rates by 3% in just six months, the fed continues to echo the need for further hikes, stoking worries among investors that the central bank could overshoot on tightening and push the economy into a deep recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The push higher in inflation, however, hasn’t yet had a material impact on the consumer, according to personal spending data Friday, to force a material change in consumer spending, suggesting a deep recession isn't on the horizon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We haven't seen that change [in consumer spending habits],” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management told Investing.com in an interview on Friday

                By Yasin Ebrahim                                Investing.com -- The Dow fell Friday, rounding off its worst quarterly losing streak since 2015 that has pushed stocks into bear-market territory as investors prepared for further Federal Reserve rate hikes to cool inflation that continues to run hot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7%, or 490 points, the Nasdaq was down 1.5%, and the S&P 500 fell 1.4%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All three major averages fell for the third straight quarter.  The personal consumption expenditure price index, the fed’s preferred inflation measure, showed that inflation rose more than expected in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This “compounds the pressure for the [Fed] to stay on course in its fight against inflation,” Stifel said in a note
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fed vice chair Lael Brainard on Friday cautioned against the central bank reversing course on monetary policy too early, saying monetary policy would need to be “restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target” After hiking rates by 3% in just six months, the fed continues to echo the need for further hikes, stoking worries among investors that the central bank could overshoot on tightening and push the economy into a deep recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The push higher in inflation, however, hasn’t yet had a material impact on the consumer, according to personal spending data Friday, to force a material change in consumer spending, suggesting a deep recession isn't on the horizon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We haven't seen that change [in consumer spending habits],” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management told Investing.com in an interview on Friday

                It was reported that a 38-year-old businessman was abducted in front of a restaurant in Pandan Indah by a group of men in a white Toyota Vellfire at 5.03pm on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ampang Jaya OCPD Asst Comm Mohamad Farouk Eshak had said the victim had gone to a restaurant alone when he was approached by a group of men

            <p>
                "He was approached by a group of men who forced him into the Vellfire

                The victim shouted for help to no avail," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the victim was later released and went straight to the Ampang Jaya police headquarters at about 10.45pm on Thursday, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was treated at Hospital Ampang

                Liverpool could have seen a glimpse of a potential replacement for Roberto Firmino in Brazil's latest victory during the last international break

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Kop will be sad to see him depart, though in reality at 31 years old, Liverpool will definitely be saying farewell to Firmino at the right time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, should Firmino, who made another 16 goal contributions last season and already six in eight games this season, depart next summer, Liverpool will have to find another player to maintain Jürgen Klopp's depth in attack
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And in order to find him, the Reds may have been given an ideal glimpse at a player who could be the perfect potential replacement for Firmino
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Flamengo's 25-year-old forward, Pedro, is regarded by many as one of the heirs to Firmino's throne in the national team, and it's easy to see why
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The forward has a similar work rate and is blessed with a technical ability that is on par with Firmino
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! This season, Pedro has already scored 24 goals for Flamengo in 53 games, but just like Firmino, his game doesn't solely rely on goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the most recent international break, Pedro showed a glimpse of his talent for the Brazilian national team, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That goal highlighted Pedro's ability to step up and play at a higher level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He may not just be an ideal heir to Firmino's throne at international level, but perhaps at Anfield, too.

                The forward has a similar work rate and is blessed with a technical ability that is on par with Firmino

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! This season, Pedro has already scored 24 goals for Flamengo in 53 games, but just like Firmino, his game doesn't solely rely on goals

                In the most recent international break, Pedro showed a glimpse of his talent for the Brazilian national team, too
            </p>
            
            <p>

                He may not just be an ideal heir to Firmino's throne at international level, but perhaps at Anfield, too.

                By Stephen Culp NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed the books on its steepest September decline in two decades on Friday, skidding across the finish line of a tumultuous quarter fraught with historically hot inflation, rising interest rates and recession fears
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It's another ugly day to end an ugly quarter in what’s looking like a very ugly year," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Investors will look back and realize this was the year the Fed pulled a total 180 on their views on inflation and quickly turned incredibly hawkish." The Federal Reserve has rattled markets by engaging in its most relentless series of interest rate hikes in decades in order to rein in stubbornly high inflation, which has many market participants eyeing key economic data for signs of a looming recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The realization that the Fed is doing anything they can to combat 40-year-high inflation has investors worried they will push the economy over the edge and into recession," Detrick added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 500.1 points, or 1.71%, to 28,725.51; the S&P 500 lost 54.85 points, or 1.51%, to 3,585.62; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 161.89 points, or 1.51%, to 10,575.62
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored decliners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 93 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 380 new lows

                By Stephen Culp NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed the books on its steepest September decline in two decades on Friday, skidding across the finish line of a tumultuous quarter fraught with historically hot inflation, rising interest rates and recession fears
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It's another ugly day to end an ugly quarter in what’s looking like a very ugly year," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Investors will look back and realize this was the year the Fed pulled a total 180 on their views on inflation and quickly turned incredibly hawkish." The Federal Reserve has rattled markets by engaging in its most relentless series of interest rate hikes in decades in order to rein in stubbornly high inflation, which has many market participants eyeing key economic data for signs of a looming recession
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The realization that the Fed is doing anything they can to combat 40-year-high inflation has investors worried they will push the economy over the edge and into recession," Detrick added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 500.1 points, or 1.71%, to 28,725.51; the S&P 500 lost 54.85 points, or 1.51%, to 3,585.62; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 161.89 points, or 1.51%, to 10,575.62
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored decliners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 93 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 380 new lows

                No.8 bus in Bangkok, which is known for overtaking

            <p>
                Infamous in the Thai capital, the No.8 route has spawned parody songs, viral TikToks, horrified YouTube videos and even a feature-length Fast & Furious-style film
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is a competition,” said driver Aphisak Sodmui, who has helmed his “hot” bus – as the non-airconditioned open-windowed models are known – for the past decade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The problem, according to Thai transport expert Sumet Ongkittikul, lies with the private firms that lease the route concession from the central Bangkok Mass Transit Authority
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Driver Aphisak supplements his daily wage of between 150 and 200 baht (RM18.50 and RM24.50) with 10% of the daily ticket sales
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have to complete the route at least four times a day for us to have enough money to live,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Passenger Sai Pin, 47, said she had seen a change since the transition to the new buses with a slightly higher fare of 15 baht (RM1.85)
            </p>

                Premier League • England A pundit reckons David Moyes could take the surprise decision to drop Jarrod Bowen amid his struggles in the Premier League recently

                This helped West Ham finish seventh in the league and reach the last four of the Europa Conference League, where they lost to eventual winners Eintracht Frankfurt

                While the West Ham ace has seen his form drop off, Rashford and Sancho are looking much better and could therefore get in the England World Cup squad ahead of him

                National Human Resources Association Malaysia (Pusma) president Zarina Ismail said that although the price cap imposed by the government is reasonable, some agencies may be charging extra for additional services they have to bear

                She also noted the extra charges may also be due to the risks which some agencies are taking following the recent memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Malaysia and Indonesia for the sourcing of domestic helpers

                She said Indonesian maids who are already in the country and who want to renew their contracts must now get an endorsement from an employment agency

                This comes after the price for hiring Indonesian domestic helpers was capped at RM15,000 following the recent MOU between Malaysia and Indonesia

            <p>
                Julian Tan, a consulting director of an employment agency, acknowledged that some agencies may be charging above the cap price for Indonesian maids

                Borrowers with incomes of less than $125,000 (or $250,000 for a couple) can qualify for up to $10,000 in debt forgiveness on their federal direct student loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This includes at least some of the loans issued through the Federal Family Education Loan, Federal Perkins Loan and Health Education Assistance Loan programs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Initially, the administration said that qualified borrowers with these privately held loans could consolidate them into a federal direct loan and obtain debt relief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Thursday, however, the department's website said that to receive relief, borrowers had to have applied for a consolidation loan by Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some FFEL and Perkins loans are held by the Education Department, so they remain eligible for the blanket forgiveness if the borrowers meet the income limits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To find out whether your FFEL or Perkins loans could qualify for forgiveness, go to your account at the Federal Student Aid site (studentaid.gov) and call up the “My Loan Servicers” list
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the servicer’s name is preceded by “DEPT OF ED,” that loan is held by the federal government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More than 5 million of those loans are held by the Education Department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the remaining, privately held but federally guaranteed loans, only a portion of the borrowers would meet the income limits for blanket loan forgiveness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The change was reported on the same day that six Republican-controlled states sued to block the blanket debt forgiveness, arguing that the administration didn't have the authority to wipe out student loan balances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By cutting off the ability to qualify for forgiveness by consolidating privately held FFELs, Perkins loans and HEALs into a direct loan, the administration is reducing lenders' and servicing companies' loss of future earnings

                Nam, who named Laksa for his choice, concurred with Golding that it would be the Penang version

                (Bloomberg) -- One of Apple Inc.’s most senior executives is leaving after he turned up in a viral video on TikTok making an off-color joke that he fondles “big-breasted women” for a living

            <p>

                He also touted that he has a “hell of a dental plan.” In reality, Blevins is Apple’s vice president of procurement and is in charge of striking deals with suppliers and partners

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Blevins has been part of a roughly 100-person group of vice presidents at Apple and one of only about 30 executives that report to either Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook or Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Williams has been Blevins’s boss for much of his career, though he briefly reported to Sabih Khan, Apple’s senior vice president of operations, according to the people
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Williams’s decision for the company and Blevins to part ways, one of the people said

            <p>
                Democrats have introduced legislation that would ban senior government officials from owning and trading stocks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bill, called the Combating Financial Conflicts of Interest in Government Act, is an attempt to limit conflict of interest for public office holders and their families when it comes to their investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The proposed bill is wide reaching
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And while it doesn’t make them clairvoyant, it’s certainly an advantage when it comes to the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Senior officials and others affected by the bill will be required to either sell their holdings when they take their position or put them into a blind trust, where they would have no control over trades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Critics have been calling for such a bill for years, but the House and Senate have long resisted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It happened soon before the Senate was expected to vote on a bipartisan bill that would see domestic chipmakers get a $52 billion subsidy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bill was passed in July and, amid the scrutiny, Paul Pelosi sold his holdings in the semiconductor manufacturer at a six-figure loss
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But months before that summer scandal, as calls for legislation to combat the issue mounted, Nancy Pelosi directed the House Administration Committee to draft a bill back in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The feeling that the well-connected in Congress have a leg up on the market has been growing over the years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it may be a while yet before Congress makes a decision on the bill

            <p>
                Democrats have introduced legislation that would ban senior government officials from owning and trading stocks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bill, called the Combating Financial Conflicts of Interest in Government Act, is an attempt to limit conflict of interest for public office holders and their families when it comes to their investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The proposed bill is wide reaching
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And while it doesn’t make them clairvoyant, it’s certainly an advantage when it comes to the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Senior officials and others affected by the bill will be required to either sell their holdings when they take their position or put them into a blind trust, where they would have no control over trades
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Critics have been calling for such a bill for years, but the House and Senate have long resisted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It happened soon before the Senate was expected to vote on a bipartisan bill that would see domestic chipmakers get a $52 billion subsidy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bill was passed in July and, amid the scrutiny, Paul Pelosi sold his holdings in the semiconductor manufacturer at a six-figure loss
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But months before that summer scandal, as calls for legislation to combat the issue mounted, Nancy Pelosi directed the House Administration Committee to draft a bill back in February
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The feeling that the well-connected in Congress have a leg up on the market has been growing over the years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it may be a while yet before Congress makes a decision on the bill
            </p>

                But how much money do you realistically need to be able to drop out of the workforce and get by on dividend payouts alone? While you will have to start by honestly assessing what you can live with — and without

            <p>
                But there’s a simple formula and some less simple risks you’ll need to consider when making the big dividend-dependency decision

            <p>
                For straight-up equity investors, those cash payouts fuel dividend income — where passively generated payouts cover your living expenses

            <p>
                But once you know how much you’ll need to live, here’s a simple formula to apply that to sort out how much you need in total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Next, consider what you can reasonably expect from dividend yields
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s fair to plan on yield rates between 1% and 6%

            <p>
                Dividend payments from a taxable brokerage account, or traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts, are considered taxable income
            </p>
            
            <p>

                This was up 22% from the previous quarter, and the highest single dividend that Devon has ever paid

            <p>
                This was down from the 72 cents reported in the year-ago quarter, but still solidly profitable – and more than enough to cover the 19.5 cent per common share dividend payment

                Proceeds from these properties generated Q2 revenues of $70.5 million, for a 44% year-over-year increase

            <p>
                These results meant that IIPR’s dividend is affordable – and in fact, management raised the dividend payment in the most recent declaration

            <p>
                The 39-year-old man’s ex-wife contacted the Brigham City Police Department to report that he had been using her son’s phone to message female teenagers, according to an incident report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The son left his phone at his father’s home

                The son told his mother that his father had been messaging girls on his Instagram account, asking for explicit photos, according to the report

            <p>
                The man sent a text to a juvenile on May 8, saying, “Your sexy as hell, send send me the sexiest picture you got,” according to the report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Let’s see what your working with?? Show me your goods,” the man said in another message, according to police

            <p>
                Liverpool are considering signing young Egyptian attacker Ibrahim Adel in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                90min report that Liverpool scouts were already ‘familiar’ with Adel before Salah’s recommendation, though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But should Liverpool make a move, Adel would have to be loaned out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As he wouldn’t be able to come into the first team straight away on account of work permit issues, Adel would be a signing for the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At twenty-one, he’s already broken into the Egyptian national team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As far as comparisons go, it would feel lazy to lump him into the Salah bracket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In that respect, perhaps a move to Liverpool wouldn’t do Adel much good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because he wouldn’t be able to play straight away, this may make it difficult for him to live up to that tag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The figures involved make it no gamble at all for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If he develops as Salah did, he’ll make a fine player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If not, Liverpool could still earn a good fee from him as they did with the likes of Taiwo Awoniyi, who never played for the club during a six-year spell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like Awoniyi, Adel looks set for a bright future in Europe whether that’s at Liverpool or elsewhere

            <p>
                90min report that Liverpool scouts were already ‘familiar’ with Adel before Salah’s recommendation, though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But should Liverpool make a move, Adel would have to be loaned out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As he wouldn’t be able to come into the first team straight away on account of work permit issues, Adel would be a signing for the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At twenty-one, he’s already broken into the Egyptian national team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As far as comparisons go, it would feel lazy to lump him into the Salah bracket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In that respect, perhaps a move to Liverpool wouldn’t do Adel much good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because he wouldn’t be able to play straight away, this may make it difficult for him to live up to that tag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The figures involved make it no gamble at all for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If he develops as Salah did, he’ll make a fine player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If not, Liverpool could still earn a good fee from him as they did with the likes of Taiwo Awoniyi, who never played for the club during a six-year spell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like Awoniyi, Adel looks set for a bright future in Europe whether that’s at Liverpool or elsewhere
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

            <p>
                "I have to apologize to the players of the national team because I caused my dear friends to be annoyed some supporters even insulted the national team," he wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's already here and has been for a very long time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And nothing is bigger than the World Cup that Iran will be participating this November in Qatar, where they're in a group with the United States, England and Wales
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The elephant in the room is what happens when Iran kick off their World Cup campaign against England on Nov
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But there is no "morality police" in Qatar -- at least not of the kind they have in Iran -- and Muslim women aren't forced to wear headscarves (though many do so by choice or custom)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Iran is not in a position to compel Qatar to do anything and even less so while the world is watching, and it has pledged to be welcoming and inclusive (at least for the duration of the tournament)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the one hand, the vast majority have family, friends and business interests in Iran and could face repercussions back home if they take a public stand in Qatar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These are the pressures facing Team Melli, six weeks removed from the World Cup

                Long live Iranian women!" The reference was clear

            <p>
                "I have to apologize to the players of the national team because I caused my dear friends to be annoyed some supporters even insulted the national team," he wrote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's already here and has been for a very long time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And nothing is bigger than the World Cup that Iran will be participating this November in Qatar, where they're in a group with the United States, England and Wales
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The elephant in the room is what happens when Iran kick off their World Cup campaign against England on Nov
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But there is no "morality police" in Qatar -- at least not of the kind they have in Iran -- and Muslim women aren't forced to wear headscarves (though many do so by choice or custom)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Iran is not in a position to compel Qatar to do anything and even less so while the world is watching, and it has pledged to be welcoming and inclusive (at least for the duration of the tournament)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the one hand, the vast majority have family, friends and business interests in Iran and could face repercussions back home if they take a public stand in Qatar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These are the pressures facing Team Melli, six weeks removed from the World Cup

            <p>
                About Us Advertise   LONDON, Sept 30 ― At a ceremony denounced by Ukraine as a “Kremlin freak show”, Russian President Vladimir Putin will proclaim the annexation of four Ukrainian regions today, escalating his seven-month war and taking it into an unpredictable new phase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin will preside over a treaty-signing on “the entry of new territories into the Russian Federation”, three days after the completion of hastily staged referendums in which Moscow's proxies in the occupied regions claimed majorities of up to 99 per cent in favour of joining Russia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But despite the triumphal setting, the annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions comes at a perilous moment for Putin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After months of grinding, attritional warfare, Ukraine seized the initiative this month by routing Russian forces in the northeastern Kharkiv region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even staunch Kremlin allies have criticised the chaotic nature of the call-up, and Putin himself said on Thursday that “all mistakes must be corrected”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nuclear threat While it holds the vast majority of Luhansk and Kherson regions, Russia controls only about 60 per cent of Donetsk and 70 per cent of Zaporizhzhia, where fighting has raged close to Europe's biggest nuclear plant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hurried annexations mean front lines will now run through territory that Russia is declaring as its own, and which Putin has said he is ready to defend with nuclear weapons if necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Western politicians called that a bluff ― something Putin explicitly denied
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The United States says it has warned Russia of catastrophic consequences if it did use a nuclear weapon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said yesterday that the Kremlin event was a “freak show”, and legally meaningless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are Russia.” The Kremlin has not yet said whether Putin will attend a celebratory concert on the square on Friday evening

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, Sept 30 ― At a ceremony denounced by Ukraine as a “Kremlin freak show”, Russian President Vladimir Putin will proclaim the annexation of four Ukrainian regions today, escalating his seven-month war and taking it into an unpredictable new phase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin will preside over a treaty-signing on “the entry of new territories into the Russian Federation”, three days after the completion of hastily staged referendums in which Moscow's proxies in the occupied regions claimed majorities of up to 99 per cent in favour of joining Russia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But despite the triumphal setting, the annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions comes at a perilous moment for Putin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After months of grinding, attritional warfare, Ukraine seized the initiative this month by routing Russian forces in the northeastern Kharkiv region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even staunch Kremlin allies have criticised the chaotic nature of the call-up, and Putin himself said on Thursday that “all mistakes must be corrected”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nuclear threat While it holds the vast majority of Luhansk and Kherson regions, Russia controls only about 60 per cent of Donetsk and 70 per cent of Zaporizhzhia, where fighting has raged close to Europe's biggest nuclear plant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hurried annexations mean front lines will now run through territory that Russia is declaring as its own, and which Putin has said he is ready to defend with nuclear weapons if necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some Western politicians called that a bluff ― something Putin explicitly denied
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The United States says it has warned Russia of catastrophic consequences if it did use a nuclear weapon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said yesterday that the Kremlin event was a “freak show”, and legally meaningless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are Russia.” The Kremlin has not yet said whether Putin will attend a celebratory concert on the square on Friday evening
            </p>

                No one seems to dislike it more than Klopp does

            <p>
                “Have a look at Kostas Tsimikas,” Klopp then warns the cameraman as he makes his way to the pitches

            <p>
                Tsimikas then wants Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah to assure him he doesn’t look like Darwin Nunez

                Then, Thailand led Asia into a regional financial crisis

            <p>
                Both worry that the yen’s plunge toward 150 to the dollar will shake Japan’s yield curve in globe-rattling ways
            </p>

            <p>
                Former Goldman Sachs uber-economist Jim O’Neill worries about a 1997-98 redux thanks to the yen’s 26% decline this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In September 1997, I also was in Beijing when Rubin and Summers cajoled Chinese officials not to devalue the yuan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was China devaluing the yuan that scared them the most
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The worry was that a weaker yuan might trigger a fresh wave of competitive devaluations not just in developing Asia, but Japan, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is once again a live concern as the yuan blows past 7 to the dollar at a moment when China’s economy is growing at the slowest pace in 30 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This week, the People’s Bank of China stepped up its defense of the yuan, cautioning against one-way bets on the currency

            <p>
                Thanks to the yuan’s downward trajectory, PBOC policy options are increasingly a mystery

                Both worry that the yen’s plunge toward 150 to the dollar will shake Japan’s yield curve in globe-rattling ways
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That would force China into the depreciatory fray
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Former Goldman Sachs uber-economist Jim O’Neill worries about a 1997-98 redux thanks to the yen’s 26% decline this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In September 1997, I also was in Beijing when Rubin and Summers cajoled Chinese officials not to devalue the yuan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was China devaluing the yuan that scared them the most
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The worry was that a weaker yuan might trigger a fresh wave of competitive devaluations not just in developing Asia, but Japan, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is once again a live concern as the yuan blows past 7 to the dollar at a moment when China’s economy is growing at the slowest pace in 30 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This week, the People’s Bank of China stepped up its defense of the yuan, cautioning against one-way bets on the currency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thanks to the yuan’s downward trajectory, PBOC policy options are increasingly a mystery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The PBOC has to control the pace of M2 growth,” Sun says

                Jurgen Klopp has seen his side battered by injuries in the opening weeks of the Premier League season but he is finally receiving some good news ahead of a hectic six weeks  One of Liverpool 's summer signings has finally began training with his new team-mates having suffered an injury before his arrival at Anfield

                One of the most common ways to create this income is to buy yourself an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Essentially, an annuity is an insurance contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will generally be a minimum payment that guarantees you don't lose your principal, but it's possible that the money won't grow at all, which is not a concern with a fixed annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of this is determined when you buy your annuity contact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That percentage only ticks up to 95.9% if you use an annuity, not enough of a difference to justify using an annuity
            </p>

                Social Security Bridge – Another Option Morningstar also details an alternative plan for making sure you have enough money in retirement without having to buy an annuity, a strategy known as the Social Security Bridge

                When you turn 70, you file for Social Security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you start taking these payments, you can reduce the amount of money you take out of your retirement accounts each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Morningstar analysis, though, shows that if you have at least 36 times your needed annual income saved at the time of retirement, you likely don't need to get an annuity

                The price of gold is actually down about 9% in 2022, while silver has fallen by nearly 20%

            <p>
                While there are many ways to gain exposure to gold and silver, he prefers to just buy the metal directly

                Earlier this year, he tweeted that he only wants “real gold or silver coins” and not the ETFs

            <p>
                “Silver is down something like 70 or 80% from its all-time high and gold is 15% below its all-time high,” he says

                In Australia, the car is available in two Blade LFP battery configurations, the first being a 49.92 kWh unit offering 345 km of range (WLTP, 410 km in NEDC), while the other is a 60.48 kWh unit rated for 420 km (WLTP, 480 km in NEDC)

                It’s already confirmed that the Atto 3 and e6 EV models have been confirmed for Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Atto 3 is already on sale in Singapore and Australia, and is due to make its market debut in Thailand next month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Australia, the car is available in two Blade LFP battery configurations, the first being a 49.92 kWh unit offering 345 km of range (WLTP, 410 km in NEDC), while the other is a 60.48 kWh unit rated for 420 km (WLTP, 480 km in NEDC)

            <p>
                Meanwhile, the e6 is a five-seater electric MPV that is already on sale in Singapore and Thailand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Singapore, the second-gen offering features a 71.7 kWh Blade LFP battery that powers a front-mounted electric motor, which offers 95 PS (94 hp or 70 kW) and 180 Nm in the way of output
            </p>

            <p>
                With a 40 kW AC onboard charger, as found on the Singapore car, a full AC charge takes 1.8 hours

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 29 — Heirs of a late South-east Asian sultan today asked a Dutch court for permission to seize Malaysian assets in the Netherlands, their lawyer said, seeking enforcement of a US$15 billion (RM70 billion) arbitration award granted to them against Malaysia’s government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s government, which has said it does not recognise the heirs’ claim, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Dutch petition

            <p>
                A French arbitration court in February ordered Malaysia to pay the US$15 billion sum — the second largest arbitration award on record — to the descendents of the last Sultan of Sulu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia obtained a stay on the ruling pending an appeal, but the award remains enforceable outside France under a United Nations treaty on international arbitration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The heirs of the sultan, who once controlled a territory spanning rainforest-covered islands in the southern Philippines and parts of Borneo island, asked the Dutch court to recognise and enforce the arbitration award

                Thursday, 29 Sep 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ASP Salwani Mohd Hadzir, 40 told the Magistrate's Court here that even though she was informed the case involved Lew, she had no idea it was pertaining to sexual harassment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I was only informed by the investigating officer DSP Noor Ashikin Shamsuri that the case involved Ebit Lew," she told counsel Ram Singh during cross-examination at the preacher’s sexual harassment trial on Thursday (Sept 29)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Salwani said she had typed in Section 509 of the Penal Code on a set of three photographs of the handphone and SIM card that she seized from Mohd Fairuz Abu on Oct 5, 2021 at his house in Alor Setar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salwani, the Staff Officer of the Kedah Police Contingent Headquarters Criminal Investigation Department’s Women and Children Section, agreed with the defence counsel that when she seized the handphone from Mohd Fairuz, she knew it contained relevant matters with regards to a Tenom case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salwani testified further that said she had read news articles on the accused via social media before she went to Mohd Fairuz's house to seize his handphone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During re-examination, the police officer said she did not inspect the contents of the seized phone as each case material is required to be sent to the Royal Malaysian Police Forensics Department for analysis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On labeling the set of photographs of the seized handphone and SIM card with Section 509 of the Penal Code, Salwani said she typed it out when delivering the seized items to the investigating officer at Bukit Aman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked by Deputy Public Prosecutor Nor Azizah Mohamad why Section 509 was typed out, the witness said it was because the investigation being carried out involved that section
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He told the court that the complainant in the case was among several sexual harassment victims to whom his NGO had extended assistance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The charge under Section 509 of the Penal Code provides for a prison sentence of up to five years or a fine, or both, upon conviction

                Wan Aizuddin showed this purported letter during Najib's trial over the misappropriation of RM2.28 billion of 1Malaysia Development Berhad's (1MDB) funds, as part of the defence's attempt to show that the millions of US dollars which had entered Najib's personal bank account in the past had allegedly originated from gifts from Saudi royalty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The contents of the purported letter to Najib that was read out also included the remark that Najib will have absolute discretion to decide how to use the gift and that the gift was merely a "token gesture" by the purported Saudi prince
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The November 2011 letter shown by Wan Aizuddin in court today was virtually identical in wording to a February 1, 2011 letter from the same purported figure who had promised to give US$100 million as a gift to Najib, with the difference mostly being only the date and the amount and details on how the money would allegedly be given
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The November 2011 letter carried the same disclaimer that the gift of millions of US dollars to Najib should not be seen as an act of corruption
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Aizuddin tried to suggest that six transactions of money that flowed into Najib's personal AmIslamic account ending 9694 from November 2011 to November 2012 would all be covered under the purported promised gift of US$375 million from the alleged Saudi prince
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Aizuddin then suggested that mathematically, the total sum of the six transactions would not exceed the US$375 million amount, with Yap then agreeing to this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Wan Aizuddin also tried to suggest that the purported promised gift of US$100 million would explain the inflow of two transactions of US$10 million each from Prince Faisal to Najib's account on February 24, 2011 (equivalent to RM30,449,929.97) and June 14, 2011 (equivalent to RM 30,179,909.46)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Wan Aizuddin also suggested that those two transactions of US$10 million in February and June 2011, and a US$49,999,988 from the Ministry of Finance Riyadh on August 18, 2011 would all be covered by the letter for the purported "personal gift or donation" of US$100 million, but Yap said he would not know as he does not deal directly with the client and that the best person to check with on this would be Yu who was the relationship manager at the bank handling Najib's accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yap today said that before he carried out the conversions of US dollar into ringgit Malaysia for the two US$10 million transactions in 2011, he had already known that the AmPrivate Banking-MR account is Najib's account as Yu had informed him of this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yap said the reason that he was told of the account holder's identity as being Najib was to enable him to correctly capture the transaction into the bank's system and also because it was a "sensitive" bank account "so that we don't easily talk too much about the transaction"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's lawyers had since yesterday been trying to show that money which came into Najib's account are instead linked to the purported gifts from the Saudi royal family

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The action comes after bailiffs acting for the Sulu Sultan seized Petronas Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz) Sàrl and Petronas South Caucasus Sàrl in Luxembourg, both of which belong to Petronas, to satisfy a US$14.92 billion (RM66.4 billion in mid-July) award by the Spanish arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa

                To recap, the legal dispute erupted after the eight heirs of the late Sulu Sultan initiated international arbitration proceedings against the government of Malaysia in end-January 2018 in Madrid, based on an 1878 agreement between Sultan Mohamet Jamal Al Alam (the Sultan of Sulu then) and Baron de Overbeck and Alfred Dent, which granted perpetual sovereign rights over what is parts of Sabah today, in return for an annual RM5,300 token payment

                So far this season, Arsenal have lost only one game -- but the VAR had a huge say in that, and without it, they'd have a 100% record
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ESPN brings you the VAR Effect Table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (Think of it like a Marvel timeline, or the plot of any time travel movie.) The VAR decision is then reversed to the original on-field call -- so if a goal is disallowed for offside, it's given as a goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If a team has been awarded a goal through a penalty or an incorrect offside through VAR, the goal is disallowed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The table shows each team's position after the amended results, with the arrows indicating if their league position is better or worse without VAR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal's lead at the top the Premier League increases from one point to two points without VAR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leeds only gain one point, with their loss at Brentford becoming a draw
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The key decision is that game against Arsenal, with the early VAR decision in their favour, meaning a victory becomes a defeat in our calculation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea lose two points as the win at home to West Ham becomes a draw, while Brentford's victory at home to Leeds is judged to be 2-2 without VAR calls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nottingham Forest also lose two points without VAR, as their 1-0 win at home to West Ham becomes a draw -- the Hammers had a goal disallowed for a foul by Michail Antonio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Crystal Palace are the only other team to lose points without VAR, as the draw at Newcastle is turned into a loss

                So far this season, Arsenal have lost only one game -- but the VAR had a huge say in that, and without it, they'd have a 100% record
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ESPN brings you the VAR Effect Table
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (Think of it like a Marvel timeline, or the plot of any time travel movie.) The VAR decision is then reversed to the original on-field call -- so if a goal is disallowed for offside, it's given as a goal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If a team has been awarded a goal through a penalty or an incorrect offside through VAR, the goal is disallowed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The table shows each team's position after the amended results, with the arrows indicating if their league position is better or worse without VAR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arsenal's lead at the top the Premier League increases from one point to two points without VAR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leeds only gain one point, with their loss at Brentford becoming a draw
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The key decision is that game against Arsenal, with the early VAR decision in their favour, meaning a victory becomes a defeat in our calculation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chelsea lose two points as the win at home to West Ham becomes a draw, while Brentford's victory at home to Leeds is judged to be 2-2 without VAR calls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nottingham Forest also lose two points without VAR, as their 1-0 win at home to West Ham becomes a draw -- the Hammers had a goal disallowed for a foul by Michail Antonio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Crystal Palace are the only other team to lose points without VAR, as the draw at Newcastle is turned into a loss

                Judge Azura also instructed the eighth prosecution witness, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) forensics department investigating officer Wan Mohd Firdaus Wan Yusof, to provide particulars of the MACC officer who had prepared the forensic report of Ahmad Zarul’s phone extraction that was produced at the Shah Alam trial

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Sept 29 — A one-month jail imposed by the High Court on Datuk Lokman Noor Adam for contempt of court is insufficient and should be increased to protect the dignity of the administration of justice, the Court of Appeal heard today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We humbly submit that the sentence imposed by the High Court is insufficient
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 15, the Kuala Lumpur High Court sentenced Lokman to a one-month jail after finding him guilty of contempt of court for intimidating a witness in former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness was Najib’s former special officer Datuk Amhari Efendi Nazaruddin, the key witness in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The contemnor further quoted some of the evidence presented in court and manipulated it in the police report to paint the picture that Najib was victimised by Amhari Efendi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A police report lodged by my client against the witness cannot be subject to contempt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How can this be intimidation?” the lawyer said in Lokman’s appeal against his conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lokman also lost his two appeals in the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court to overturn the High Court’s ruling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas had initiated the committal proceeding against Lokman to seek an order for Lokman to be committed to prison or be fined for his action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Thomas, on September 25, 2019, Lokman uttered words in a video interview that constituted an express or implied threat against Amhari Efendi for having given evidence in the former prime minister’s trial at the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas said that on the same day, Lokman lodged a police report against Amhari Efendi in respect of the evidence given by him at the trial
            </p>

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Sept 29 — A one-month jail imposed by the High Court on Datuk Lokman Noor Adam for contempt of court is insufficient and should be increased to protect the dignity of the administration of justice, the Court of Appeal heard today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We humbly submit that the sentence imposed by the High Court is insufficient
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 15, the Kuala Lumpur High Court sentenced Lokman to a one-month jail after finding him guilty of contempt of court for intimidating a witness in former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness was Najib’s former special officer Datuk Amhari Efendi Nazaruddin, the key witness in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The contemnor further quoted some of the evidence presented in court and manipulated it in the police report to paint the picture that Najib was victimised by Amhari Efendi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A police report lodged by my client against the witness cannot be subject to contempt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How can this be intimidation?” the lawyer said in Lokman’s appeal against his conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lokman also lost his two appeals in the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court to overturn the High Court’s ruling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas had initiated the committal proceeding against Lokman to seek an order for Lokman to be committed to prison or be fined for his action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Thomas, on September 25, 2019, Lokman uttered words in a video interview that constituted an express or implied threat against Amhari Efendi for having given evidence in the former prime minister’s trial at the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas said that on the same day, Lokman lodged a police report against Amhari Efendi in respect of the evidence given by him at the trial
            </p>

                (Bloomberg) -- Porsche AG is set for a bullish trading debut after parent Volkswagen AG set the final listing price for the sports-car maker at the upper limit, seeking to defy deep market upheaval
            </p>

            <p>
                Porsche’s listing is set to be the largest in Europe since miner Glencore Plc raised almost $10 billion in a London IPO in 2011, the data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The share price puts Porsche at a valuation that’s not far from VW’s total market capitalization -- a business that comprises Audi, Skoda, Seat, and the VW brand, among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen divided Porsche’s share capital into equal parts voting and non-voting shares, with the German carmaker retaining 75% ownership

            <p>
                Rowe Price and ADQ have together committed to take up as much as 3.7 billion euros of the IPO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other 12.5% of total shares up for grabs is going directly to VW’s largest shareholders –- the billionaire Porsche and Piech family –- via their investment company Porsche Automobil Holding SE
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family already owns a 53% majority of VW’s voting shares, and under the IPO terms, they will also get 25% plus 1 share of Porsche AG’s voting stock, paying a small premium to preferred shares for a total of 10.1 billion euros
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche is targeting revenue of as much as 39 billion euros this year and return on sales of as much as 18%, up two percentage points from last year, the company said in July

            <p>
                According to an analysis from Bernstein, Porsche’s market capitalization should sit at 80 billion euros – just below luxury companies but at the higher end of carmakers

                The move, one of the legal steps Russia says will lead to formal annexation of 15% of Ukraine's territory, confirms that Putin is doubling down on his war against Ukraine despite suffering a major military reversal this month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The annexation, after what Kyiv and Western countries say were phoney referendums staged at gunpoint on Russian-held Ukrainian territory, has been rejected in the West as an illegal seizure of land captured in war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Washington and the European Union are set to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the plan, and even some of Russia's close traditional allies, such as Serbia and Kazakhstan, say they will not recognise the annexation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin's annexation ceremony will be held in one of the Kremlin's grandest halls with the pro-Russian figures Moscow considers to be leaders of the four Ukrainian regions -- Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After days of speculation over exactly how Russia would mark the annexation, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed some details of the ceremony on Thursday

                Moscow's planned annexation of 15% of Ukraine's territory, after what Kyiv and Western countries say were phoney referendums staged at gunpoint in Russian-occupied areas, shows Putin doubling down on his war despite suffering a major reversal on the battlefield this month and discontent at home over a widely criticised partial military mobilisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin said that "all mistakes" made in a call-up to reinforce Russia's military operation in Ukraine should be corrected, his first public acknowledgment that the "partial mobilisation" he announced last week had not gone smoothly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia's votes were a sham and a "futile attempt to mask attempted land grab in Ukraine." Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan pressed Putin in a call to take steps to reduce tensions in Ukraine

                He did not say whether Putin would attend the Red Square concert, as he did a similar event in 2014 after Russia proclaimed it had annexed Ukraine's Crimea region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A tribune has already been set up on the Moscow square with giant video screens and billboards proclaiming "Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson - Russia!" A political adviser to the Ukrainian president said on Thursday the ceremony "does not make legal sense" and would be a "Kremlin freak show." Washington and the European Union are set to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the annexation plan, and even some of Russia's close traditional allies, such as Serbia and Kazakhstan, say they will not recognise the move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some military experts say Kyiv is poised to deliver another major defeat, gradually encircling the town of Lyman, Russia's main remaining bastion in the northern part of Donetsk province

                The move, one of the legal steps Russia says will lead to formal annexation of 15% of Ukraine's territory, confirms that Putin is doubling down on his war against Ukraine despite suffering a major military reversal this month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The annexation, after what Kyiv and Western countries say were phoney referendums staged at gunpoint on Russian-held Ukrainian territory, has been rejected in the West as an illegal seizure of land captured in war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Washington and the European Union are set to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the annexation plan, and even some of Russia's close traditional allies, such as Serbia and Kazakhstan, say they will not recognise the move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin's annexation ceremony will be held in one of the Kremlin's grandest halls with the pro-Russian figures Moscow considers to be leaders of the four Ukrainian regions -- Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After days of speculation over exactly how Russia would mark the annexation, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed some details of the ceremony on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin would deliver a major speech on the subject, he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A big concert will be held on Friday on Moscow's Red Square, where a tribune with giant video screens has already been set up, with billboards proclaiming "Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson - Russia!" Peskov did not say whether Putin would make an appearance at the concert
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He did so at a similar event in 2014 after Russia proclaimed it had annexed Ukraine's Crimea region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its fall could open the way for Ukrainian forces to launch attacks on swathes of territory that Russia now aims to annex
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's Defence Ministry said a day earlier that a Ukrainian offensive on Lyman had failed, with 70 Ukrainian soldiers killed

            <p>
                NUCLEAR UMBRELLA Russian government officials have said that the four regions will fall under Moscow's nuclear umbrella once they have been formally incorporated into Russia

            <p>
                DAP and PKR have leftist leanings, while Umno Baru and Bersatu have rightist leanings (Malay first, Malaysian last, not second - my definition)

                Few would disagree with him, especially Harapan supporters

                This is probably due to PAS leaving Bersatu for Umno

            <p>
                Can you enlighten me on what you mean by ‘leftist’ Harapan not suitable for Malaysia?  Anyway, it would be bizarre if, according to you, the leftist Harapan emerged victorious at the end of the general election and kicked out all the rightist politicians like you

            <p>
                So, voting for Bersatu or PAS is not going to solve the problem of kleptocracy in Malaysia

                Wan Saiful, you and your brethren, for political survival, serve an ecosystem of equally lazy, corrupt politicians and their base
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bersatu treats non-Malays as "serfs"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It creates a non-Malay wing and non-Malays can join it as associate members but without voting rights
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Surely, as a researcher, Wan Saiful should have known that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Socio-political conservatism, you state
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You mentioned that "our country was founded by first prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman’s principles of freedom and justice"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DAP and PKR have leftist leanings, while Umno Baru and Bersatu have rightist leanings (Malay first, Malaysian last, not second - my definition)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Few would disagree with him, especially Harapan supporters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is probably due to PAS leaving Bersatu for Umno
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Can you enlighten me on what you mean by ‘leftist’ Harapan not suitable for Malaysia?  Anyway, it would be bizarre if, according to you, the leftist Harapan emerged victorious at the end of the general election and kicked out all the rightist politicians like you
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, voting for Bersatu or PAS is not going to solve the problem of kleptocracy in Malaysia

                Deputy public prosecutor Mohd Ashrof Adrin Kamarul revealed this in the High Court when Najib’s case – where he faces three money laundering charges involving RM27mil of SRC International funds – came up for mention

                On Aug 23, the Federal Court upheld the Kuala Lumpur High Court’s decision to convict Najib and sentence him to 12 years’ jail and a fine of RM210mil in the RM42mil SRC case

                By Indradip Ghosh BENGALURU (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve will hike its key interest rate to a much higher peak than predicted two weeks ago and the risks are skewed towards an even higher terminal rate, according to economists polled by Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But that is unlikely to push the Fed to switch its policy path anytime soon as Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers have remained blunt about the "pain" to come

            <p>
                Indeed, over 70% of economists, 59 of 83, predicted the central bank would hike its fed funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight meeting in November, a Reuters poll taken after the Fed meeting last week showed

                "The short-run pain of recession would be better than the long-run pain of inflation expectations becoming unanchored." Also, unlike most major central banks, the Fed has backing from a strong currency and a relatively strong economy compared with its peers

                Any money that is not converted into an annuity can remain in the workplace savings plan

                This proliferation of annuities within retirement plans is a byproduct of the SECURE Act, the comprehensive retirement legislation signed into law in 2019

                The alarm in Malaysia has now rung loud and clear after a 23-year-old Malaysian citizen named Goi Zhen Feng became Malaysia’s first recorded death from overseas job scams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goi, a teacher in training, was supposedly held in Myawaddy, Myanmar, which borders Mae Sot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But who runs these syndicates? What do they want and how do they lure thousands of people to fall straight into their trap? How many people are actually being held captive overseas and what is the government’s stand on the issue? Let Malay Mail break it down for you
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A victim who was named as Eric reportedly said he was brought to a rural place in Cambodia and was given a mobile phone to work for a telephone scam company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How many Malaysians have fallen victim to these scams? Officially, the police’s secretary Datuk Noorsiah Mohd Saaduddin said on August 19 that a total of 238 Malaysians have fallen victim to overseas job scam syndicates between 2021 and then, with 168 in the clutches of these gangs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Special Functions) Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad also told the press on September 20 that an exact number of victims could not be ascertained as only about half of the cases have been reported to the police, making authorities unable to put an exact number of Malaysian victims who have fallen into the syndicate’s trap
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On each floor there were about 300 people, mostly Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The victim named Eric also shared that he was kept at a 13-storey building resembling a hotel and there were 10 groups consisting of 10 people or more for each group at each floor of the building
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goi’s death was the push needed for Putrajaya to put this matter on the top of their list, after a memorandum was sent to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to seek the government’s assistance and intervention in the job scam issue abroad with Malaysians as the victims were sent in by a group of NGOs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then instructed Dr Abdul Latiff to take charge of the matter, and on September 20, the special functions minister said that he would bring up the job scam issue involving Malaysian victims abroad to Cabinet after chairing a meeting with Goi’s family and the NGOs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On September 27, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Abdullah chaired a coordination meeting with government agencies to refine, frame, monitor and implement action concerning job scam syndicate cases involving Malaysian citizens abroad

                The alarm in Malaysia has now rung loud and clear after a 23-year-old Malaysian citizen named Goi Zhen Feng became Malaysia’s first recorded death from overseas job scams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goi, a teacher in training, was supposedly held in Myawaddy, Myanmar, which borders Mae Sot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But who runs these syndicates? What do they want and how do they lure thousands of people to fall straight into their trap? How many people are actually being held captive overseas and what is the government’s stand on the issue? Let Malay Mail break it down for you
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A victim who was named as Eric reportedly said he was brought to a rural place in Cambodia and was given a mobile phone to work for a telephone scam company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How many Malaysians have fallen victim to these scams? Officially, the police’s secretary Datuk Noorsiah Mohd Saaduddin said on August 19 that a total of 238 Malaysians have fallen victim to overseas job scam syndicates between 2021 and then, with 168 in the clutches of these gangs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Special Functions) Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad also told the press on September 20 that an exact number of victims could not be ascertained as only about half of the cases have been reported to the police, making authorities unable to put an exact number of Malaysian victims who have fallen into the syndicate’s trap
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On each floor there were about 300 people, mostly Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The victim named Eric also shared that he was kept at a 13-storey building resembling a hotel and there were 10 groups consisting of 10 people or more for each group at each floor of the building
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goi’s death was the push needed for Putrajaya to put this matter on the top of their list, after a memorandum was sent to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to seek the government’s assistance and intervention in the job scam issue abroad with Malaysians as the victims were sent in by a group of NGOs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then instructed Dr Abdul Latiff to take charge of the matter, and on September 20, the special functions minister said that he would bring up the job scam issue involving Malaysian victims abroad to Cabinet after chairing a meeting with Goi’s family and the NGOs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On September 27, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Abdullah chaired a coordination meeting with government agencies to refine, frame, monitor and implement action concerning job scam syndicate cases involving Malaysian citizens abroad

                The letter said the gift was in appreciation of Najib’s new ideas as a modern Islamic leader and also in view of the friendship the two had developed over the years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s counsel Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed read out the letter, said to be signed by the prince on Feb 1, 2011
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the letter, among others, stated that the prince granted Najib US$100mil as a gift to be remitted into Najib’s account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Najib shall have absolute discretion to determine how the gift shall be used to promote Islam

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 43-year-old also testified that nothing was done to stop the transfer of US$620mil out of Najib’s bank account in August 2013, as no red flag was triggered by the bank when the transactions took place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Later, another witness said RM2.23bil flowed into Najib’s personal from a prince and two entities linked to fugitive financier Low Taek Jho between 2011 and 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AmBank Private Banking Capital Market Desk head Yap Wai Keat, 57, testified that the money, from Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners, Tanore Finance Corp and Prince Faisal Bin Turkey Bandar Al Saud, was transferred into Najib’s account ending with the number 694
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners and Tanore Finance Corp deposited nearly RM2.2bil into Najib’s account via 11 transactions in 2012 and 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yap said he became involved in Najib’s 694 account on the orders of Joanna Yu, who is Najib’s AmBank relationship manager, to assist in matters pertaining to foreign exchange

                Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the decision, the latest in Malaysia’s continued relaxation of Covid-19 rules, took into consideration the country’s improving Covid-19 situation as well as better aircraft practices and technology

            <p>

                Acting on The Star’s tip-off, a team of enforcers from the Health Ministry raided the beautician’s hair salon in Setapak yesterday and confiscated dental probes, dental fillings and nickel-titanium wire that is commonly used for braces

            <p>
                Health Ministry dental officer Dr Taufik Firdaus – who acted as the lead raiding officer – said a preliminary investigation found that the beautician, who denied having any helper, was not registered with the Malaysian Dental Council

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the 36-year-old beautician, who remained calm during the operation, claimed that she acquired her skills from an Indonesian woman who also provided a one-day course

                She was commenting on Malaysia’s average life expectancy at birth which has gone down from 74.4 years in 2012 to 73.4 years in 2022 due to the increase in the number of excess deaths during the pandemic
