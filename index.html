                The Federal Court made it clear to both the prosecution and defence that it is sticking to the hearing dates for the SRC appeal from August 15 to 26 as scheduled when the case came up today for management
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Federal Court today informed both the prosecution and Najib's lawyers that this application will also be heard on August 15
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In today’s case management, Najib's new lawyers told the Federal Court that their client will not press to have Laidlaw represent him in the SRC case
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib’s new defence team made their first appearance in today’s case management at the Federal Court, which took place on Zoom

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This will be Najib's final appeal in the SRC case, as he had previously been found guilty at the High Court in July 2020 and had lost his appeal at the Court of Appeal in December 2021.

                Premier Abang Johari Openg said Sarawak needed to study the fund management and governance along with their investment strategies, legal and policy framework

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Abang Johari is leading a delegation to meet officials at the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in London today

                He hoped that the IFSWF officials would be able to share their expertise and knowledge on the operation and governance of state-owned investment funds

                This comes after law minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar said the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) had decided not to prosecute anyone over the matter after the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) wrapped up its investigation

                The PKR information chief said the defence ministry was the one that lodged the original MACC report over the procurement

                “PAC should conduct an investigation into this matter to ascertain whether any serious issues related to this case require urgent legal redress, especially as this involves our nation’s defence and public funds,” he told FMT

                In June 2019, the defence ministry lodged a report with MACC over the purchase of the six helicopters in 2015, which it had yet to receive at that time

                On Nov 18 last year, Thomas and the government submitted an application to quash the suit after claiming that the former prime minister's action in suing them was a collateral attack to prevent criminal proceedings against him

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the statement of claim, Najib claimed that he had been wrongly accused in court in the case of 1MDB, International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), abuse of power under the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009 and money laundering under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA 2001)

                According to a Borneo Post report, Karim said the Elections Act was a federal law which meant that Sarawak only needed to wait for Parliament’s anti-hopping bill to be gazetted for it to be enforced

                Meanwhile, Melaka chief minister Sulaiman Md Ali said the Barisan Nasional state government was ready to amend its state enactments to implement a similar anti-hopping law

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Bangi MP Ong Kian Ming said the decision to ban chicken exports, which he said “may look like a workable short-term solution”, had ended up hurting chicken producers and chicken imports instead
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This impact was felt most strongly in Singapore, which imports one-third of its chicken supplies from Malaysia, including almost all of its live chickens.” The DAP MP pointed out that the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) announced a list of new farms and establishments which could export chicken products to Singapore, including from Australia, Brazil and Thailand, as well as the approval of three establishments in Indonesia to export chicken meat and related meat products to the country
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the agriculture and food industries ministry must understand that the path to food security was not through providing enough supply for the domestic market, but also by producing enough supply to export to foreign markets
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Instead of harming local chicken farmers by short-term policies such as the export ban and by putting in price controls that are not reflective of the underlying cost of production, Mafi (the ministry) should be putting in place plans to help our chicken farmers expand their domestic production and access to foreign markets.” Ong suggested that the ministry work together with the Federation of Livestock Farmers Association of Malaysia to provide soft loans through Agrobank for long-term investments and expansion in this sector
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said market access for chicken producers should be expanded to other countries, including the halal markets in the Middle East
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the ministry should assure export markets, especially Singapore, that such export bans would not be implemented again and that contractual sanctity would be respected

                State deputy education minister Dr Annuar Rapaee said the Sarawak government had always been appreciative of talent

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sarawak has recognised the UEC since 2014, allowing holders of the certificate to work in the state civil service and apply for scholarships from Yayasan Sarawak and for entry into the state-owned University of Technology Sarawak
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Federal education minister Radzi Jidin recently said his ministry had no plans to recognise the UEC as it went against the National Education Policy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Annuar said the world was now borderless and the government should not restrict anyone from acquiring the education of his or her choice
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Education should be progressive and allow for better and more diverse human capital,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The federal government’s role should be more towards financially supporting state governments in education matters.” Aside from its recognition of the UEC, the Sarawak government is aggressively pursuing mastery of English

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ukraine's armed forces denied carrying out the strike, saying Russian artillery had targeted the prison to hide the mistreatment of those held there and lay the blame on Ukraine

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Russian defence ministry said that the prison housed Ukrainian prisoners of war and that eight prison staff were also wounded

                Separately, Ukraine said at least five people had been killed and seven wounded in a Russian missile strike on the southeastern city of Mykolaiv, a river port just off the Black Sea, as Russia fired across frontlines in eastern and southern Ukraine

                Russia and Ukraine agreed last week to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports, which have been threatened by Russian attacks since it invaded Ukraine on Feb

                Indonesia, said Saravanan, had also agreed to integrate the existing system between Malaysia’s Immigration Department and its embassy in Kuala Lumpur for the recruitment of Indonesian domestic workers (PDI)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the integration of this system would act as a single channel for the recruitment and entry of PDI into Malaysia as agreed in the previous Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This system will be operational in three more weeks under the supervision of the Malaysia-Indonesia Joint Working Group,” he said in a statement with his Indonesian counterpart, Ida Fauziyah, as reported by Bernama
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Therefore, the Indonesian side has agreed to withdraw the restrictions on the entry of PDI and Indonesian labourers (TKI) into Malaysia starting Aug 1 (Monday),” said Saravanan

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saravanan was in Jakarta in conjunction with the meeting of the Joint Working Group between Malaysia and Indonesia as outlined in the MOU regarding the PDI, which was completed on July 27

                She added that the effectiveness of the implementation of the commitments made in the MOU was also important before Indonesia sent the PDI back to Malaysia in August.

                State labour department director Wan Zulkifli Wan Setapa said there was a worrying trend every year as 200,000 residents were recorded leaving Sabah in search of job opportunities
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Sabah also relied on foreign workers in the plantation, construction, restaurant and agricultural sectors, and according to immigration department data, there were more than 135,000 non-resident workers in the state, more than 50% of whom were Indonesians
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If the relocation of the Indonesian capital to Kalimantan in 2024 attracts Indonesians who are working in Sabah, (even) if 50% of these (Indonesian) workers leave, the state economy could collapse
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Related parties need to look at the matter in order to find an alternative or exit policy to overcome and resolve the (labour) issue,” he said when speaking at the 2022 Sabah Labour Convention here

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When met by reporters later, he said all parties needed to brace themselves for the eventuality because the two-year horizon was not that distant as Sabah was already facing a labour crisis

                However, the news was untrue and Khalid was still under treatment at a private hospital
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When contacted, Khalid's former political secretary Faekah Husin said it was a callous act to spread such a rumour
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The post by Khalid's team, on his official Facebook Timeline, also demanded that the rumour be immediately stopped out of respect for the former mentri besar's family as they were already facing a difficult time
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is understood that Khalid is suffering from kidney failure and undergoes dialysis

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khalid had also undergone an open-heart surgery sometime earlier this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khalid was a prolific mentri besar during his tenure from 2008 to 2014 and being a stickler for efficiency, ensured the smooth running of the state government machinery
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Being frugal, Khalid also held on very tightly to the state’s purse strings which saw Selangor’s coffers having a healthy balance
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was ousted by his party PKR in 2014 which saw Khalid vacating the mentri besar’s position and then assumed by former party deputy president Datuk Seri Azmin Ali.

                Thomas confirms why he is one of this country's top lawyers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Thomas is one of the best legal minds to have occupied the chair of attorney-general
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                So, what purpose has the hotel briefing achieved? Did attorney-general Idrus Harun explain the way Thomas wrote here? Obviously not, as many of the attendees were not happy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Will the government acknowledge and take the actions proposed here? Or will it still appoint a special task force headed by former attorney-general Mohamed Apandi Ali? The problem is that the government now views Thomas as enemy number one
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But what I find annoying about this new law is it creates unequal treatment under the law
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Are they treated equally in law? The answer has to be no
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Because it’s legal for one person but not for the other to smoke
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But there is already a law in place
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It just grates when a law discriminates
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                So I expect this law will be passed in Parliament
