            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib’s lawyers are now expected to train their focus on a single core point, namely that trial judge Nazlan Ghazali was clearly in a position of conflict in relation to persons, events, and issues he had dealt with during the trial
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They will also submit to the apex court that the judge’s failure to disclose his conflict prior to or during the trial deprived Najib the opportunity of applying to recuse Nazlan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib’s legal team will also seek to persuade the Federal Court that events subsequent to the trial and the initial appeal warrant the admission of further evidence to determine whether Nazlan was presiding despite his conflict of interests
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Likewise, no arguments will be advanced to suggest any impropriety in the outward transfer of High Court judge Sofian Razak from the criminal court in which the trial took place

                His appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on Dec 8 last year

                Takahashi Katsuhiko said the success of the festival was due to the “palpable” support of Malaysians for diversity
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Recently I observed very intense discussions regarding the Bon Odori festival in Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Previously, the festival made headlines when religious affairs minister Idris Ahmad reminded Muslims not to take part in the Japanese community’s annual summer festival, claiming that the celebration was “influenced by elements of other religions”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Idris’ statement prompted the Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, to instruct the Selangor Islamic religious department (Jais) to allow the festival to proceed
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The ruler also reportedly asked Idris, Jais, and the Shah Alam City Council (MBSA) officers to attend Bon Odori to “see for themselves” what takes place at the festival

                Furthermore, PSB had not disclosed the newcomer, Chong said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Therefore, he said, PSB president Wong Soon Koh’s proposal “did not make good political sense”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “That should not be the aim of cooperation among the opposition parties, unless Wong has another agenda up his sleeve.” On Sunday, Chong said that seat negotiations with PSB had reached a dead end after Wong said Sarawak DAP must “sacrifice” one parliamentary seat, a request which the former deemed unreasonable
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This led to Wong accusing Sarawak DAP of being unwilling to give up a seat

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said that the party was willing to give up some of the seats it contested in the last nationwide polls to other opposition parties, including PSB, if it meant increasing the opposition’s chance of winning

                “From the doctor’s medical examination, there are signs of a previous assault,” he said at a press conference after the Johor police shooting competition with the media, in conjunction with Police Day at the REM Farm shooting range in Kota Tinggi here today

                Tang said the results showed that 31 per cent of respondents believed the myth that a woman cannot get pregnant during her period, while 20 per cent answered that they were unsure of the correct answer

                Sanusi, who is also the Kedah menteri besar, said Bersatu’s decision to quit Pakatan Harapan and form the government with PAS and Umno was something that needed to be appreciated
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairuddin said recently that PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was wrong to work with the Muhyiddin Yassin-led Bersatu instead of Umno, adding that this had not benefited the Islamic party
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also believed that if Hadi had defended PAS’ relationship with Umno, Bersatu would have acceded to it since it was a small party that depended on PAS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In defending Bersatu, Sanusi said Muhyiddin’s party would have just stayed in the PH government if it truly prioritised politics
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a final dig at Khairuddin, Sanusi said the former plantation industries and commodities minister was “more Umno than some people in Umno”

                The arrival of the workers followed the memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the recruitment of Bangladeshi workers signed between Malaysia and Bangladesh on Dec 19, he said

                The MoU, effective for five years, was signed by Saravanan and Bangladesh expatriates’ welfare and overseas employment minister Imran Ahmad in Kuala Lumpur

                That’s now playing out around Taiwan
            </p>

                "There is a new normal, or a new status quo, in terms of kind of the military presence that China will have around Taiwan.” The strategy places greater pressure on the US to craft a response that encourages China to pull back without escalating tensions further, like when then-President Bill Clinton sent two aircraft carrier groups into the area during the last Taiwan Strait crisis
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s drills last week were larger and closer to Taiwan than a similar show of force in the mid-1990s

                China "deterred Taiwan independence forces and completely shattered the so-called strait median line,” Meng Xiangqing, a professor at the PLA’s National Defense University in Beijing, told state broadcaster China Central Television

                "But I don’t think they’re going to do anything more.” China’s exercises also demonstrated the risk that any conflict over Taiwan could quickly escalate and shake global supply chains

                He said it is now common anywhere in the world for the number of cases reported to be less than the actual number of infections due to more relaxed testing protocols

                Khairy said that when the country is transitioning to the endemic phase, the focus must be on the severity of the cases, which can be seen through the number of deaths and hospital admissions
            </p>

                He pointed out that the country’s baseline number of cases has increased due to the Omicron BA.5 variant but the situation is under control as long as the number of deaths and hospital admissions remain low

                Agus Rizal Mat Ali, 50, a director of UC Travel Sdn Bhd, was charged with advertising haj package services using the furada visa for the 2022 season on the company’s Facebook page, claiming that he could organise travel for the purpose of pilgrimage to the holy land although the company did not have a valid haj operator licence from Lembaga Tabung Haji

                The charge was framed under Section 27 (1) (b) of the Tabung Haji Act 1995 punishable under Section 27 (2) of the same law, which provides for a maximum fine of RM100,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year or both upon conviction

                Joseph Wu told a press conference in Taipei that Taiwan, which is claimed by China as its own, would not be intimidated even as the drills continued with China often breaching the unofficial median line down the Taiwan Strait

                US President Joe Biden, in his first public comments on the issue since Pelosi's visit, said yesterday he was concerned about China's actions in the region but he was not worried about Taiwan

                In Sydney, locals and tourists shared warm memories of growing up with the soundtrack of Newton-John, including songs such as "Physical" and "Hopelessly Devoted to You"

                Klang MP Charles Santiago said more than 200 straight-A Indian students were denied entrance into the pre-university matriculation system while Bumiputera admissions were at 90%

                “It’s important to remember that many of these children come from the B40 low-income group, where education is the only way out

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But instead, they are kept trapped by an apartheid system,” he said in a statement

                “Instead of making university admissions accessible based on merit, the government chooses to play the race card.” Santiago said this disparity denied students access to higher education despite obtaining good grades

                Besides that, Wong gave an example of how the PAC handles sensitive information, citing the PAC Proceedings related to the Procurement of the Covid-19 Vaccine and its Use Against Malaysians, in which it reached an agreement with Khairy Jamaluddin, then minister of Science, Technology and Information, to remove the procurement price of Covid-19 vaccines from Hansard

                Of the eight appeals, five involved Pacific & Orient Insurance Co Bhd, Amgeneral Insurance Bhd, Allianz General Insurance Company (M) Bhd, and Malaysian Motor Insurance Pool

                If a vehicle injured a victim, that person could sue the owner or the driver of the vehicle

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This was because if the vehicle owner had insurance coverage, the insurer (insurance company) would automatically step in and “indemnify” the victim, without the victim having to sue the insurer
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In one of the cases, the vehicle owner had “sold” the vehicle to a third party through what is known as “sambung bayar” (continuing payments), without informing the insurance company

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Stressing that such regulations only serve to “constrict and strangle” Orang Asli communities, the lawyer was adamant that the Orang Asli should have the right to harvest forest produce for commercial purposes as they have been doing so with minimal impact to the land for “thousands of years”

                On Sunday, Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Mohd Zuki Ali announced the formation of the committee, chaired by Attorney- General Tan Sri Idrus Harun

                During the incident on Aug 3, the Immigration operations head at KLIA was said to be at the receiving end of the rebuke when apparently no Immigration officers were stationed at the VIP lane between 8.40am and 9.40am

                The next day, the Public Service Department (PSD) refuted claims of its director-general having publicly castigated the Immigration official, saying that the charges against the former were baseless and intended to tarnish his image as a high government official

                Sutera Auto Sdn Bhd account executive, Rozana Khalid, 43, who was involved in the process of closing the account for the purchase of the vehicle, said that Shahrir made full payment for the white car, using a cheque, on Dec 21, 2013

                During the examination-in-chief by Rasyidah regarding the meaning of “cash payment”, the seventh prosecution witness said that there were three ways of doing so, namely cash, credit card and cheque

                Loke said Wee’s decision demonstrated that an open tender for the project was not feasible despite the latter’s insistence on calling for a fresh tender in August 2020
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                “I want to tell both (Finance Minister Datuk Seri) Tengku Zafrul (Abdul Aziz) and Wee to ‘eat back their own words’

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The open tender did not proceed but the contract was renegotiated

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After the PH government collapsed in 2020 and was replaced by Perikatan Nasional, Wee took over as the transport minister and said the project would be reopened for tender, before mocking Loke for not choosing this “cheaper” option

                “If we took this to court, for sure the government would have lost the case and we could have to pay compensation to the company and the project would have come to a halt

                Sutera Auto Sdn Bhd account executive, Rozana Khalid, 43, who was involved in the process of closing the account for the purchase of the vehicle, said that Shahrir made full payment for the white car, using a cheque, on December 21, 2013
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The seventh prosecution witness also confirmed the copy of the cheque worth RM118,485 and the payment receipt, shown by deputy public prosecutor Rasyidah Murni Azmi
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During the examination-in-chief by Rasyidah Murni regarding the meaning of cash payment, the seventh prosecution witness said that there are three ways of cash payment, namely cash, credit card and cheque
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Rozana said that the probability for a person to buy a car in cash is only one or two per cent
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                For example, out of 50 units of cars sold, maybe two or three people will buy in cash and the payment will be made either in the form of cash or credit card,” said Rohana, who has served the company for 13 years

                Shahrir, 72, was charged with money laundering, by not stating his real income in the Income Tax Return Form for Assessment Year 2013, which is a violation of Section 113(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1967, on the RM1 million, believed to be from unlawful activities, which he received from Najib through a cheque

                Last week, The Star reported that the Bersatu-led Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition might pull its support for Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, which could trigger the collapse of the federal government

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Justice Rozana Ali Yusoff said this in her dismissal of Ahmad Zahid's injunction application against Muhyiddin during an online proceeding here on Monday (Aug 8)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The High Court dismissed the application with RM5,000 in costs

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In today's proceedings, the court heard the plaintiff's (Ahmad Zahid) application for an interim injunction against the defendant

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Bagan Datuk MP claimed that Muhyiddin’s statement implied that he had used a shortcut to settle and postpone his ongoing court cases, that he had asked for Muhyiddin’s help to intervene in the court cases and the judiciary system, to order the dissolution of the Johor State Assembly and also implied that he was not a respectable and exemplary leader

                Muhyiddin claimed that when he heard the plaintiff’s request, he told the latter that he could not and would not interfere with the court proceedings and advised the plaintiff to defend himself in court if he was truly innocent

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During case management last month, the Federal Court dismissed Najib's new defence counsel's application to adjourn the hearing of the appeal, which was fixed for Aug 15 to 26
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As a result, the hearing of Najib's application to adduce further evidence with regard to then High Court trial judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali has been fixed to be heard first on Aug 15, followed by the hearing of the former premier's appeal to set aside his conviction and sentence

                They took over the case from Shafee, who was removed on July 25
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib said he hopes that the appointment of the new defence team will bring a fresh or different perspective to the case as he is headed for the final appeal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction and sentence in Najib's appeal, and in a strongly-worded judgement described how SRC, which started off as a national interest venture, had in the end become a national embarrassment
