            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Emilia’s counsel Nizam Bashir Abdul Kariem Bashir argued that Article 126 of the Federal Constitution indicated that the power to initiate committal proceedings lies within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, Court of Appeal and the High Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nizam said the Kuala Lumpur shariah court could not hear the committal proceedings against his client because she is no longer a resident of the Federal Territory and now lives in Kajang, Selangor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also rejected Emilia’s application to suspend the ongoing committal proceedings in the shariah high court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Other respondents are the Registrar of the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court, the Chief Registrar of the Federal Territories shariah court of appeal, the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court, the Kuala Lumpur shariah court of appeal and the government of Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Based on the judicial review application, Emilia said she did not live or reside in the Federal Territory during the “hadhanah” (custody) proceedings filed at the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court on July 23, 2018
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Emilia sought a declaration that the Kuala Lumpur shariah high court and shariah court of appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear and punish any individual who contravenes the court, as it is the exclusive rights of the civil courts, according to Article 126 of the Federal Constitution

                Syed Mohsin Syed Sagaf, 65, said the former Felda chairman paid the money after his son’s company, YM Auto Wheels Enterprise, issued three invoices for RM206,100, RM256,950 and RM86,040 respectively
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to the witness, he used his son’s company to issue the invoices because he did not own a company
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Syed Mohsin said that in October 2013, Shahrir had asked him to find a contractor for the project, which is now known as Sri Anugerah, because the politician knew that he had many friends who worked as contractors

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Tan Sri Shahrir and I visited the project site and we discussed the payment for the rehabilitation work and when it could begin,” said Syed Mohsin, who said he had known Shahrir for over 30 years

                When he ran out of funds, the witness met Shahrir at his office and asked for payment

                Just over three in five sexually-active Malaysian youths say they had their first sexual experience at the age of 22 or younger

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                — 123rf.com The number of Malaysian youths involved in sexual intercourse has doubled since 2016, according to a recent survey

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to the Sexual Health and Intimate Wellness Survey 2022, which spoke to over 1,000 Malaysians aged between 18 and 30, 35.4% of them had had sexual intercourse, compared to 18.8% from the first survey in 2016

                Fellow Suhakam commissioner Ragunath Kesavan said the appointments of lawyers Hasnal Rezua Merican Habib Merican and Nazira Abdul Rahim did not go against any provisions in the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act 1999
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was reported that Hasnal is the Selayang Umno deputy chief while Nazira is the head of the women’s wing of Kulim Umno
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hasnal was also reportedly Barisan Nasional’s former legal adviser

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ragunath, a former Bar Council president, said there was no provision in the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act that prohibited individuals with political ties from becoming a Suhakam commissioner
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The new Suhakam chairman, Rahmat Mohamad, had also been slammed over his past stance against ratifying the Rome Statute, by which Malaysia would accede to the International Criminal Court

                The Transport Minister also said food delivery riders will not be compelled to take their vehicles for checks at Puspakom inspection centres

                Certain media reports recently claimed that amendments would be made to the Road Transport Act, the Commercial Vehicle Licensing Board Act and the Land Public Transport Act, which would require p-hailing riders to own a GDL

                Suaram said any legal action against newsreader Sydney Yap would threaten press freedom in Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “We urge Bernama to focus on addressing the issues that have been raised by her,” Suaram executive director Sevan Doraisamy said, referring to Yap’s claims of pay cuts and less airtime for the agency’s Mandarin unit
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, FMT reported that Bernama would be suing Yap for alleged defamation over the newsreader’s claims
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysiakini quoted Bernama as saying Yap’s comments, which were published in a Facebook post, had tarnished the image of the state-owned agency and even the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Bernama said the manpower shortage was an industry-wide issue for Mandarin broadcasters
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) also condemned Bernama for threatening to sue Yap, describing such action as “unnecessary”

                Taiwan rejects China’s sovereignty claims, says the island’s people should decide its future and vows to defend its democracy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China had said in two previous white papers on Taiwan, in 1993 and 2000, that it “will not send troops or administrative personnel to be based in Taiwan” after achieving unification
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                That line, meant to assure Taiwan it would enjoy autonomy after becoming a special administrative region of China, did not appear in the latest white paper
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s ruling Communist Party had proposed that Taiwan could return to its rule under a “one country, two systems” model, similar to the formula under which the former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A line in the 2000 white paper that said “anything can be negotiated” as long as Taiwan accepts that there is only one China and does not seek independence, is also missing from the latest white paper
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi (right) presented the state government’s findings on weekend rest days to Johor Ruler Sultan Ibrahim Ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar during an audience held at Istana Danga in Johor Baru

                About Us Advertise   ALBUQUERQUE (New Mexico), Aug 10 ― A Muslim immigrant from Afghanistan has been arrested as the prime suspect in the serial killings of four Muslim men that rattled the Islamic community of New Mexico's largest city, police said yesterday
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Investigators are still piecing together motives for the killings of the four men, Deputy Commander Kyle Hartsock of the Albuquerque Police Department said at a news conference
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The three most recent victims all attended the Islamic Center of New Mexico, Albuquerque's largest mosque

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They were all shot near Central Avenue in southeastern Albuquerque

                Fong Soong Hert (right, in a police mugshot) admitted to killing his wife of 28 years,  Pek Ying Ling, in 2021

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After deliberation with his attorneys on Tuesday morning (Aug 9), Fong Soong Hert, 51, admitted to killing Pek Ying Ling, his wife of 28 years, last year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The trial at Newcastle Crown Court was delayed for an hour and a half as Fong met his attorneys, with proceedings originally meant to get under way at 10.30am local time
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After the jury was led in, the judge opened the day's session by informing them of the change in plea, while Fong showed no emotion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Fong smothered his 51-year-old wife's face with a pillow on Dec 6 last year at the County Aparthotel in Newcastle, Britain
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court heard that Fong called his son Alonzo the next morning to tell him that his mother was not responding and that he hoped she "could still be saved"

                Khairuddin Aman Razali said Malay-Muslim voters should either support PAS or Umno in the coming 15th general election to avoid any further split between the two largest Malay-based parties
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In May, Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had even said MN was “as good as dead”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “So, there is no need to conclude that MN is buried, as no Umno or PAS leader has come out to declare it so
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairuddin said that even though he wanted PAS and Umno to continue working together under MN, it did not mean Bersatu should be left out of the pact
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “We understand that Umno does not want anything to do with Bersatu,” the former PAS central committee member said, referring to Umno’s decision to cut ties with Muhyiddin’s party
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “In my opinion, it would be a loss (for PAS) to leave Umno and work with Bersatu, but that is the president’s and the party’s right (on who they choose to work with).” He said although Hadi’s strategy had backfired by choosing PN over Umno in the Johor and Melaka elections, he did not discount the possibility that teaming up with Umno as well would have reaped benefits at that time

                KYIV (Reuters) -     Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of exploiting its position in a nuclear power plant it had seized to target a nearby town in a rocket attack that killed at least 13 people and left many others seriously wounded
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The town Ukraine says Russia targeted - Marhanets - is one that Russia has alleged Ukrainian forces have used in the past to shell Russian forces who are holed up at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which they took over in March

                There was no immediate comment from Russia on the Ukrainian allegations of a rocket attack on Marhanets and Reuters could not independently verify the allegations

                CRIMEAN AIR BASE ATTACK The head of Ukraine's state nuclear power firm on Tuesday warned of the "very high" risk of shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and said it was vital Kyiv regained control of the facility in time for winter

                Klang MP Charles Santiago said more than 200 straight-A Indian students were denied entrance into the pre-university matriculation system while Bumiputera admissions were at 90%
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “It’s important to remember that many of these children come from the B40 low-income group, where education is the only way out
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But instead, they are kept trapped by an apartheid system,” he said in a statement

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Instead of making university admissions accessible based on merit, the government chooses to play the race card.” Santiago said this disparity denied students access to higher education despite obtaining good grades

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said education minister Radzi Jidin’s recent acknowledgement of the education system’s stagnation, due to an unwillingness to change, came as no surprise

                Takahashi Katsuhiko said the success of the festival was due to the “palpable” support of Malaysians for diversity

                “Recently I observed very intense discussions regarding the Bon Odori festival in Malaysia
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Previously, the festival made headlines when religious affairs minister Idris Ahmad reminded Muslims not to take part in the Japanese community’s annual summer festival, claiming that the celebration was “influenced by elements of other religions”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Idris’ statement prompted the Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, to instruct the Selangor Islamic religious department (Jais) to allow the festival to proceed
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The ruler also reportedly asked Idris, Jais, and the Shah Alam City Council (MBSA) officers to attend Bon Odori to “see for themselves” what takes place at the festival

                This was because if the vehicle owner had insurance coverage, the insurer (insurance company) would automatically step in and “indemnify” the victim, without the victim having to sue the insurer
