            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                An amendment to the Sales Tax Act passed on Thursday calls for a 10% sales tax to be imposed on imported low-value goods purchased online and delivered to Malaysia by vendors registered with the finance ministry
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The government must be very clear on this or else it will be subject to abuse.” At present tax on online sales is limited to imported goods that cost more than RM500
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                With local manufacturers currently subjected to a 5% to 10% sales tax, finance minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz previously stated that the tax would “level the playing field” and generate RM200 million in revenue annually
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the new tax would play a crucial role in addressing the discrepancy that local manufacturers face since they have to pay a sales tax whereas imported LVGs are exempted
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Even without the MoU, they still have a simple majority.” Ismail had become prime minister in August last year with the support of 114 MPs, giving his government a simple majority in the Dewan Rakyat

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In March, Loke had proposed an extension to the MoU on the condition that Ismail delivers on all items in the agreement

                should not turn a blind eye to what can be an epidemic of short-sightedness among the young

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Research published this year found that eight out of every 10 pupils tested at a rural Chinese primary school in Bentong suffered from vision problems, with about 60% of them being myopic (short-sighted) and 16% hyperopic (far-sighted)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Different screen sizes of these devices make near-vision tasks a challenge, resulting in longer viewing times
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This situation can cause fatigue to the visual system – previous studies showed that excessive near-vision tasks can accelerate the progression of myopia,” the scientists said in their report
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The research team, led by Prof Datuk Dr Rokiah Omar of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, published their research earlier this year in Malaysian Family Physician, the journal of the Academy of Family Physicians of Malaysia and Family Medicine Specialists Association of Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                In the alleged scolding incident last Wednesday, the Immigration operations head at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was said to have been at the receiving end because it was believed that there were no Immigration officers stationed at the VIP lane between 8.40am and 9.40am

                A recent news report claimed that PN might pull out of the government and withdraw support for Ismail

                However, Kiandee, who is on the PN Supreme Council, said the coalition had given its commitment to continue supporting the prime minister and the current government

                “The mandate period of the 14th general election (in 2018) will end in May next year, so we have given our commitment to continue supporting the prime minister and this government

                “That’s hilarious!” Najib responded in a Facebook post

                However, Najib did not respond to a threat by Rafizi that he would divulge details of shell companies used to launder money from the RM9 billion littoral combat ship project, which entails the construction of six corvette-class ships for the navy

                He said the finance ministry under PH had wanted to sell a 28-storey office tower in Hong Kong belonging to China Evergrande Group for RM1.6 billion, and had held talks to sell a 60% stake in the Bandar Malaysia mixed commercial project for RM7.41 billion to property developer Iskandar Waterfront Holdings and China Railway Engineering Corp

                The LCS project was the subject of a report by Parliament’s watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee, which said that not a single ship had been completed despite RM6 billion being spent since 2011

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Over the past month, some Bersatu leaders had been pressing Ismail to honour his promise to elect a deputy prime minister from the party, as was previously agreed when Bersatu decided to support Ismail’s appointment as prime minister
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Wasn’t there a promise with PH, in which Bersatu was a component, for Dr Mahathir Mohamad to be prime minister for two years, after which the position would be handed over to Anwar Ibrahim?” he said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “That was a clear breach of promise too.” Similarly, Hassan pointed to Hamzah’s collusion with Mahathir to organise the Malay Dignity Congress in 2019, calling it part of the efforts to derail Anwar’s promised premiership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the end, he said, it was Muhyiddin who became prime minister instead of Anwar
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “For them to now accuse Ismail of forgetting his promise, well it’s clearly a case of the pot calling the kettle black,” Hassan said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Ismail had cleverly countered Bersatu’s threats not to support his administration by stating that a general election (GE15) must be held if that happens
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hassan said such a move would also see Bersatu receive a lot of flak from the public, and be seen as defiant to the King’s mandate, calling for political stability

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, Aug 7 — Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg today stressed that the state government will protect non-Muslims and care for them to achieve togetherness and inclusion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said as an example the Sarawak government has channeled aid to non-Muslims through the Unit for Other Religions (UNIFOR) on the basis that non-Muslims also need the protection and care of the state government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the state government has also provided an allocation of RM70 million to build UNIFOR Building in Jalan Ong Tiang Swee, Kuching, so that its administration is more organised and the implementation of religious activities under UNIFOR is more orderly
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I am confident and believe that togetherness in terms of religious development between the Muslim and non-Muslim communities in Sarawak will give birth to a society that is friendly to each other and avoids prejudices that can cause division,” the premier said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said as the head of the state government who is a Muslim, he has always insisted that the “Charter of Medina” is a very suitable guide to guarantee fair administration for the multi-ethnic and multi-religious communities in Sarawak
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Abang Johari said in Sarawak, with the high spirit of understanding and unity that has been built over the years a multi-ethnic and religious community of small Keluarga Sarawak under the auspices of a large Keluarga Malaysia has been established

                On DAP’s stand regarding the prime minister candidate, Loke said the party was firmly behind Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, though the Seremban MP did not rule out the need for compromise if no party had a clear majority after the 15th general election

                “We do not think that that particular case will damage the party’s image,” he said indicating that the party trusts Lim and is confident of Lim’s integrity

                Former Johor housing and local government exco member Datuk Abd Latif Bandi (middle) his son Ahmad Fauzan Hatim (right) and property consultant Amir Shariffuddin Abd Raub have been freed of all their corruption and money laundering charges

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Sessions Court here found that Abd Latif, 56; his son Ahmad Fauzan Hatim, 30; and Amir Shariffuddin Abd Raub, 49, did not go against the law in their activities that involved bumiputra lots
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Amir Shariffuddin was also charged with 33 counts of corruption and 13 counts under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds from Unlawful Activities (Amla) Act 2001, while Ahmad Fauzan Hatim was charged with four counts of money laundering
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Among the charges, Abd Latif was accused of having abetted Amir Shariffuddin to convert bumiputra lots into non-bumiputra lots

                However on Nov 7, 2021, the Johor Baru High Court ordered the three accused to enter their defence on the 37 counts of corruption and money laundering charges after finding the Sessions Court had erred in its decision to free and acquit them

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry said two agreements or conventions have been signed, namely the Treaty on Principle Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, 1967 (OST 1967) and Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space, 1968 (ARRA 1968)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It also said that Malaysia’s membership in the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN Copuos) since 1994 shows the country's commitment to carrying out its responsibilities in the space sector at the international level
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Malaysia’s commitment has been proven through the gazettement of the Malaysian Space Board Act 2022 (Act 834) on Jan 25, 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "With the existence of Act 834, it allows the government, through the ministry, to consider the necessary actions to ratify all international agreements or conventions related to space in line with the country's priorities and interests,” it said
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It added that three more international agreements or conventions related to space that have yet to be signed are the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 1972 (LIAB 1972); Convention of Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, 1975 (REG 1975) and Agreement Governing the Activities of State on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, 1979 (MOON 1979).- Bernama

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a statement today, Shahrizat said that the Court of Appeal's decision reinforcing that Malaysian women cannot confer citizenship is devastating for Malaysian women
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In this case, the Malaysian government had appealed against the High Court's September 9, 2021 decision, which recognised that Malaysia’s citizenship laws discriminated against women and which had ruled that Malaysian mothers whose children are born overseas should also be entitled to Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While waiting for the Court of Appeal to decide on the appeal, the six Malaysian mothers who filed the suit managed to obtain citizenship documents from the National Registration Department (NRD) for their overseas-born children
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This was because the High Court and Court of Appeal refused to allow the government to defer issuing the citizenship papers while waiting for the appeal to be decided
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After the decision on Friday, lawyer for the six Malaysian mothers, Datuk Gurdial Singh Nijar informed the Court of Appeal that his clients would be appealing to the Federal Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Court of Appeal however, ruled that status quo should be maintained for the overseas-born children of the six Malaysian mothers who had obtained the Malaysian citizenship papers, until the Federal Court decides on their appeal

                “They are the group we hope to target, and we will also carry out other efforts to attract non-Malay support for Bersatu and Perikatan Nasional (PN).” The former Pemanis assemblyman was asked about the wing’s efforts to attract non-Malay support for Bersatu after the resignation of Segamat MP Edmund Santhara Kumar as the head of the party’s associate wing

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked why non-Malays should join Bersatu when the party is spearheaded by one race only, Chong said that the wing he leads does not fight for race-based issues alone
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Bersatu’s associate wing is more about diversity of issues as opposed to becoming a ‘champion’ fighting for race and racial issues,” said Chong

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Bersatu president Muhyiddin Yassin accepted Santhara’s resignation as the party’s associate wing chairman on July 28

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Santhara will, however, remain a Bersatu member and continue to back Muhyiddin’s leadership, a source told FMT

                US President Joe Biden attends a meeting virtually during his isolation after being diagnosed as having a rebound case of Covid-19 on July 30 (2022)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                — Reuters It's been known for several months that rebound infections can occur in Covid-19 patients who were treated with the antiviral medication Paxlovid
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A relatively rare phenomenon, the so-called “Covid-19 rebound” after treatment with Paxlovid can occur between two to eight days after the patient initially tested negative again, the US health authority wrote in an advisory in May (2022)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Dr Stefan Kluge from Germany’s University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) agrees that Covid-19 rebound isn’t a major issue from a medical point of view
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Far less than 5% of Covid patients treated with Paxlovid experience a return of symptoms, he says
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It’s still not clear why Covid-19 symptoms can reoccur so soon after recovery from a previous infection

                Many of these highly regarded convent schools were built over 100 years ago, with the first IJS school as well as orphanage set up in Light Street, George Town, in 1852
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a rare interview, Sister Mary Theresa Chua, the Provincial of the IJS – which is legally known as the Lady Superior of the Society of Saint Maur – says the estimated RM3mil annual grants from the Education Ministry (MOE) for all 56 schools would only be enough for basic maintenance, working out to around “RM50,000 to RM70,000 for each school’’
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The site borders the Kuala Lumpur Forest Eco Park, and Sister Theresa fears that the ongoing wet spell and the year-end rainy season would be a problem

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 2020, a landslip also hit the school, which was established in 1899, after heavy rain caused a near collapse of a retaining wall

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sister Theresa describes the plight of convent schools in Malaysia, which have produced hundreds of thousands of students including prominent figures, as desperate

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sister Theresa says there is an urgent need for the MOE to meet Mission school authorities to talk about critical building issues, such as, for example, electrical appliances like airconditioners, computers and projectors that have led to capacity overload

                Gobi Krishnan, who was reportedly sacked from his position in Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu), has urged the party president and leadership to step in over the issue of his removal
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gobi Krishnan, who is the associate members' wing information chief, also continued to slam the newly appointed associate member’s wing leader, Dr Chong Fat Full, over his sacking
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This is needed, especially since party grassroots nationwide are increasingly questioning Dr Chong’s actions which seem to be opposing the party’s constitution,” said Gobi Krishnan in a statement on Saturday (Aug 6)
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I hope the party will take stern action against Dr Chong immediately for the benefit of the wing and the party,” he said.

                Dennis Ignatius said special envoys like Bintulu MP Tiong King Sing must take their cue from the government they represent
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said foreign minister Saifuddin Abdullah had made a statement that was carefully balanced and nuanced, “treading a fine line between both the US and China”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, Saifuddin had said that Malaysia held on to the One China policy and urged all concerned parties to approach the situation carefully
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ignatius said Tiong’s comments were “out of line” in going further than the official line and had put Malaysia in a difficult situation, as Malaysia had recently welcomed Pelosi and was mindful of the fact that the US was an important trading and security partner
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A 36-year veteran in the foreign service, Ignatius said Tiong should be reminded that his role as special envoy was to represent Malaysia and articulate the views of the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China had described Pelosi’s trip an “egregious provocation.” Ignatius, who had previously served in Beijing, said the Tiong incident showed up a common problem among some special envoys

                Besides PBB, the other three GPS member parties are Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS), which has two parliamentary seats, Progressive Democratic Party (PDP), also with two seats, and Sarawak United People’s Party (SUPP), with one seat

                Soniakaur's son Calvin died in the accident in Old Jurong Road on Aug 4, 2022

                He said Calvin, her eldest son, had been in an accident, and the mother-of-five's first instinct was to rush to the hospital

                Police said former sport and youth minister Roy Suryo's arrest was aimed at preventing him from removing any evidence

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Former sport and youth minister Roy Suryo's arrest, which included the seizure of his Twitter account and mobile phone, was aimed at preventing him from removing any evidence, said police spokesperson Endra Zulpan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Investigators decided to detain Roy Suryo Notodiprojo starting tonight as a suspect in a hate speech case," Zulpan told reporters at a press conference on Friday (Aug 5)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Suryo commented at the time that the edited pictures of the leader's face on a statue at the Unesco World Heritage Site were "funny"
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A Buddhist organisation and a Buddhist man filed separate police reports seeking his arrest

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Suryo, however, is not currently facing charges under that law.

                The BN meeting comes in the wake of an Umno Supreme Council meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                An Umno source confirmed a report by The Star earlier today which said BN secretary-general Zambry Abdul Kadir had notified the heads of the various component parties of the meeting

                Umno secretary-general Ahmad Maslan had said after the party’s Supreme Council meeting that the party machinery at all levels was urged to focus on getting prepared to face the elections, “whichever date that will be decided”
