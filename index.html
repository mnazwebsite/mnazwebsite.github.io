                New York state police identified the suspect involved in Friday morning's attack as Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old from Fairfield, New Jersey

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A number of people rushed to the stage and took the suspect to the ground, before a trooper present at the event arrested him

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Carl LeVan, an American University politics professor attending the event, told AFP he saw the suspect run onto the stage where Rushdie was seated and "stabbed him repeatedly and viciously." LeVan, a Chautauqua regular, said the suspect "was trying to stab him as many times as possible before he was subdued," adding that he believed the man "was trying to kill" Rushdie

                "Najib has attempted to link Mahathir to Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) being forced to use part of the funding for the LCS to pay off NGPV’s bad debts," he said referring to the New Generation Patrol Vessel (NGPV) project, which was conceptualised in 1990, when Najib was defence minister in Cabinet

                "Najib was deeply involved in the NGPV project, being the defence minister from 1990 to 1995 as well as from 2000 to 2008," he said, referring to Mohamad Sabu and Liew Chin Tong, who were defence minister and deputy during the PH administration

                On August 10, Najib had accused the Defence Ministry during the PH administration of purportedly "freezing” the LCS project for 15 months since September 2019 for investigations

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sociopolitical analyst Awang Azman Pawi noted that the LCS scandal was being used as a “political weapon” with opposition parties PKR, Amanah and DAP attacking Umno leaders over the issue
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Political analyst James Chin of the University of Tasmania’s Asia Institute said he was sure PH were hoping to capitalise on the LCS controversy “The opposition is thinking… ‘If we can manage to make the LCS scandal as big as 1MDB, then maybe we can follow the same tactic to get rid of BN’,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “So that’s why everyone is playing up the LCS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The scandal led to BN losing power over the federal government for the first time

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Although the opposition has cast Umno leaders as the villains in the controversy, Awang Azman said PH could have handled the issue better when it was in government (from 2018 to 2020) by forming a royal commission of inquiry or pushing for investigations by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission

                Anwar had announced last Saturday (Aug 6) that Sangkar would be the Sabah PKR state leadership council chairman for the 2022-2025 period, replacing Liew who has held the post since October 2016

                KINIGUIDE | Over the last two weeks, the country has been gripped by the latest multi-billion ringgit scandal involving the Royal Malaysian Navy’s (RMN) second generation patrol vessel - more commonly known as the littoral combat ship (LCS) - project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                What is an LCS?  The concept was first introduced by the US Navy with two classes of LCS - Freedom and Independence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The concept is for cheap - for the US - small, and stealthy surface combat vessels for littoral zone warfare and operations
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Littoral warfare means military operations in the littoral zone
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Apart from the US, Malaysia is the only country to have surface combatants designated as LCS

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Karl Andersson from the University of Manchester spent three months researching how readers “experience sexual pleasure” when reading Japanese shota comics
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I had hit a wall in my research,” Anderson wrote in the abstract of his 4,000-word article published in the journal Qualitative Research
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “And so I realised that my body was equipped with a research tool of its own that could give me, quite literally, a first-hand understanding of shota.” Andersson, who is originally from Sweden, also concluded that masturbation could be an act of “self-care”, and that the activity was when “we are least alone”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Thinking more critically about my own masturbation also made me wonder if all sex is masturbation, in the sense that people are focused on their own pleasure and use other people as ‘masturbation material’,” he wrote
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While the paper was originally published online in April, it went viral on Twitter earlier this week, sparking debate about research ethics and values

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Many questioned the ethics of the paper, saying it was bordering on paedophilia due to the nature of shota comics

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 12 — Parti Bangsa Malaysia (PBM) is urging the federal government to enact new legislation criminalising cyberbullying

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As a point of reference, Muniraa cited an example of Singapore's Protection from Harassment Act
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Enacted in 2014, the law was designed specifically to make cyberbullying, stalking and online harassment within and out of the workplace a criminal offence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Stressing the need to stamp out the menace, Muniraa also cited a Unicef report which had ranked Malaysia second in Asia for cyberbullying among youths in 2020

                Citing the Public Accounts Committee’s (PAC) report on the project, Bukit Mertajam MP Steven Sim said then defence minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had decided on the SETIS system instead of the navy’s choice of the Tacticos system
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The SETIS system chosen by the minister is not only more expensive, it has yet to be fully developed, and is also at risk of becoming obsolete in five to 10 years
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sim said switching from the initial Sigma-class ships chosen by the navy to the Gowind design of Naval Group of France in 2011 could have set Malaysia’s naval ship manufacturing industry back by years
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Malaysia missed out on the chance for technology transfer, pointing to how the Sigma-class was designed by the Dutch company Damen Shipyard, which was supposed to make Malaysia its manufacturing hub
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                Former President Donald Trump home in Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Justice Department asked a judge on Thursday to make public the warrant that authorized the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, after Trump, a Republican, portrayed it as political retribution

                In this case, Trump himself announced the search in a Monday night statement

                Will Trump's lawyers object? It was unclear whether Trump's legal team would object to the release of the warrant

                The finished ship, or Say Hong Chun, stands at 4.88m (16ft) high, 4.88m long and 1.83m (6ft) wide

                The Say Hong Chun and an effigy of the King of Hades (Tai Su Yeah) will be burnt in a final ritual to send off departed loved ones to mark the seventh lunar month celebration

                “Malaysia as a pioneer in the global halal industry can certainly help Japan which has a high interest in developing its halal industry.” Ismail Sabri also suggested that both countries explore cooperation to resolve problems related to supply chains, adding that during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in May, he called for regional supply chains to be strengthened with supporting investment in digital infrastructure

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Malaysia University of Science and Technology economics professor Geoffrey Williams told StarBiz that a ringgit to US dollar peg should not be the government’s policy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Tengku Zafrul explained that a peg would not be the best move for the economy, as it would require Malaysia to follow the monetary policy of the country to which the ringgit is pegged to

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Williams also explained that it is a fallacy to claim one can “buck the market” and control the exchange rate because the ringgit’s value depends on the value of the US dollar as well, which one cannot control

                The financial daily reported that judge Wan Ahmad Farid Wan Salleh made the decision after M Kogilambigai, representing the AGC, did not object to the application to challenge the seizure orders
            </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In April, Wan Ahmad Farid granted them leave to challenge BNM’s orders to freeze several of i-Serve’s accounts

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, after the first leave for judicial review was granted, BNM issued several new seizure orders and claimed that this rendered i-Serve’s first legal challenge academic

                In a Facebook post, Sydney Yap said that “instead of taking positive action” to review the working conditions of journalists after she raised concerns about various bureaucratic practices in Bernama, the agency’s CEO Roslan Ariffin had instead “made false allegations to me (sic)”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “… (this) is extremely unprofessional and I will post a full statement to respond as soon as possible.” However, the newsreader did not elaborate on the false accusations allegedly made by Roslan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yap, who is set to leave the news agency, previously said she wanted to speak out during her final days at Bernama in order to raise awareness of problems faced by the media
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was previously reported that Bernama wanted to sue the newsreader for alleged defamation over claims that the Mandarin broadcast news unit was seeing pay cuts and less airtime
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yap wrote a lengthy Facebook post last week after Bernama announced that its 6pm Mandarin news programme would only air from Monday to Friday
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, speaking to Malaysiakini yesterday, Roslan said that the message circulated to the media that Yap would face legal action was actually an internal report and recommendation from Bernama’s human resources department
