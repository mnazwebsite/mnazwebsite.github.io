                When we were informed yesterday (Sept 12) by ASP Mohd Adnan Alias of the Brickfields District Police that the Deputy Public Prosecutor’s (DPP) Office of Kuala Lumpur had directed that charges be filed against two of our editors, Azam Aris and M Shanmugam, we were shocked that they were intervening in what, if anything at all, is essentially a civil dispute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the losses would have been much more had the manipulation continued in a big way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a media that reports on the stock market and corporate sector extensively, we have a responsibility to highlight important matters to the investing public — including alerting them about how stock prices are being manipulated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are, therefore, baffled as to why the police and the DPP’s Office of Kuala Lumpur are pressing criminal defamation charges against us for informing investors about stock market manipulation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Where is the defamation? If the complainant, who is a private businessman, feels that we have defamed him, the police and DPP should ask him to file a civil suit against us instead of using public resources

            <p>
                When we were informed yesterday (Sept 12) by ASP Mohd Adnan Alias of the Brickfields District Police that the Deputy Public Prosecutor’s (DPP) Office of Kuala Lumpur had directed that charges be filed against two of our editors, Azam Aris and M Shanmugam, we were shocked that they were intervening in what, if anything at all, is essentially a civil dispute
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the losses would have been much more had the manipulation continued in a big way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a media that reports on the stock market and corporate sector extensively, we have a responsibility to highlight important matters to the investing public — including alerting them about how stock prices are being manipulated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are, therefore, baffled as to why the police and the DPP’s Office of Kuala Lumpur are pressing criminal defamation charges against us for informing investors about stock market manipulation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Where is the defamation? If the complainant, who is a private businessman, feels that we have defamed him, the police and DPP should ask him to file a civil suit against us instead of using public resources

                The Uruguayan has been linked with a move to Anfield numerous times in the past and it's been claimed Jurgen Klopp opted to make a move for the Los Blancos star this summer

                Liverpool tried to pull off a last-minute £86.5million deal for Real Madrid's Federico Valverde The Uruguayan midfielder has been linked with a move to Anfield numerous times in the past Liverpool made a bid of £86.5million in the final two days of the summer transfer window, according to Diario AS.  The same report, however, suggests that the Spanish giants rejected the offer as they found it 'brutal' and 'offensive' - dismissing they would sell the star, let alone that late in the transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real Madrid clearly found the offer unacceptable, despite the fact that fee would have made Valverde the second most expensive sale at the club ever, only surpassed by the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Boss Jurgen Klopp missed out on his target and instead signed Juventus' Arthur Melo on loan Valverde remains under contract with Real until the summer of 2027, after only just extending his contract last summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reds boss Jurgen Klopp missed out on his target and ended up signing Juventus midfielder Arthur Melo on a season-long loan deal, with the option to buy the Brazilian for £32m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arthur Melo has completed his season-long loan move from Juventus to join Liverpool  Liverpool also paid a loan fee of £3.9m to secure the services of the 26-year-old to help ease the crisis in midfield

                Liverpool tried to pull off a last-minute £86.5million deal for Real Madrid's Federico Valverde The Uruguayan midfielder has been linked with a move to Anfield numerous times in the past Liverpool made a bid of £86.5million in the final two days of the summer transfer window, according to Diario AS.  The same report, however, suggests that the Spanish giants rejected the offer as they found it 'brutal' and 'offensive' - dismissing they would sell the star, let alone that late in the transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Real Madrid clearly found the offer unacceptable, despite the fact that fee would have made Valverde the second most expensive sale at the club ever, only surpassed by the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Boss Jurgen Klopp missed out on his target and instead signed Juventus' Arthur Melo on loan Valverde remains under contract with Real until the summer of 2027, after only just extending his contract last summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reds boss Jurgen Klopp missed out on his target and ended up signing Juventus midfielder Arthur Melo on a season-long loan deal, with the option to buy the Brazilian for £32m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arthur Melo has completed his season-long loan move from Juventus to join Liverpool  Liverpool also paid a loan fee of £3.9m to secure the services of the 26-year-old to help ease the crisis in midfield

            <p>
                He claimed that the slanderous statement meant that he was not born as a Malay or a Muslim with the alleged original name of “Mahathir son of Iskandar Kutty” and that he claimed to be a Malay when he became prime minister to gain political and personal advantage apart from belittling Malaysians of Indian Muslim descent

                On Sept 12, Prime Minister Hun Sen paid tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II at the British embassy in Phnom Penh, writing in their condolences book that he was filled with "profound grief" to have learned of the passing of the Queen at Balmoral Castle in Scotland

            <p>
                The late Queen, Hun Sen wrote, emerged as a beloved public figure through her reign, her discipline and the ways she inspired people and that she will forever be remembered in the hearts of all of the British people and the hearts of many others around the world

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, Sept 12 — A Sarawak rights advocate today called for a restructuring of Parliament to better provide constitutional protection for Borneo Malaysia under the Malaysia Agreement 1963
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Peter John Jaban said the restructuring would be more effective compared to allocating 35 per cent of seats in Dewan Rakyat to Sarawak and Sabah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is against the principle of democracy for the Special Council on Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) to agree to allocate 35 per cent of the parliamentary seats to the two territories that have a combined 20 per cent of the country’s total population,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said Sabah and Sarawak should also not be allowed a disproportionate influence in a properly functioning democracy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The endorsement would enable Sabah and Sarawak to have 78 of the 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, Sept 12 — A Sarawak rights advocate today called for a restructuring of Parliament to better provide constitutional protection for Borneo Malaysia under the Malaysia Agreement 1963
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Peter John Jaban said the restructuring would be more effective compared to allocating 35 per cent of seats in Dewan Rakyat to Sarawak and Sabah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is against the principle of democracy for the Special Council on Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) to agree to allocate 35 per cent of the parliamentary seats to the two territories that have a combined 20 per cent of the country’s total population,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also said Sabah and Sarawak should also not be allowed a disproportionate influence in a properly functioning democracy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The endorsement would enable Sabah and Sarawak to have 78 of the 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat
            </p>

            <p>
                “I think the reason why Sabah has among the most landmarks or buildings named after the royal family was because of the relations between the British and Sabah, which was previously known as North Borneo,” he said

            <p>
                Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-serving monarch (70-year reign) in British history, died peacefully in Scotland on Sept 8.

            <p>
                Assoc Prof Dr Bilcher Bala, who teaches history at Universiti Malaysia Sabah’s (UMS) Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, said that the hospital was named after Queen Elizabeth II
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I think the reason why Sabah has among the most landmarks or buildings named after the royal family was because of the relations between the British and Sabah, which was previously known as North Borneo,” he said

            <p>
                Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-serving monarch (70-year reign) in British history, died peacefully in Scotland on Sept 8.

                The research house noted that the OPR hike could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term but will not have a too negative impact on corporates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current OPR rate of 2.5% is still below the pre-Covid level of 3%, leading CGS-CIMB to forecast the central bank to raise the OPR by another 50 bps (via two 25-bps hikes) next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The rate hike is also negative for companies with high floating-rate ringgit borrowings, due to higher interest expense
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Our analysis shows the OPR hike having the largest positive impact on Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd (7.6% increase in financial year 2023 or FY23 net profit for every 25-bps hike) as its forecast floating-rate loan ratio of 91% in FY23 is the sector’s highest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Conversely, the impact would be the smallest on Affin Bank Bhd’s forecast FY23 net profit (0.2% increase for every 25-bps hike) as its forecast FY23 floating-rate loan ratio of 74.1% is one of the lowest in the sector,” CGS-CIMB noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It added that if it were to factor in the OPR hike projected in 2023, every additional 25-bps hike would increase its net profit forecasts for banks by an estimated 2.1% (on a full-year basis; for FY24 for Hong Leong Bank Bhd, AMMB Holdings Bhd and Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd, and FY23 for the rest)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The positive impact from the OPR hike could be partly diluted by higher cost of funds from a pick-up in deposit competition,” it said.

                There are some rumours coming out of Indonesia that we are due to see a next generation Toyota Innova launched there as early as November 2022, which is 2 months from now, and it might be called the Toyota Innova Zenix
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What is called the Toyota Innova in the Malaysian market is called the Toyota Kijang Innova in Indonesia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is a top of the line variant there called the Toyota Kijang Innova Venturer, so the word Zenix might be some form of top of the line variant suffix
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alternatively, the name of the car could be renamed to Innova Zenix or simply Zenix, just like how the Avanza Veloz eventually became just the Toyota Veloz with the latest generation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Essentially, the new Toyota Innova Zenix will end up being a three-row MPV version of the Toyota Corolla Cross
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Veloz sits below the Kijang Innova, priced from Rp 286,000,000 for the manual up to Rp 331,100,000 for the Veloz Q CVT with Toyota Safety Sense

                About Us Advertise BERA, Sept 11 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob today said that he has yet to discuss with Umno’s top five the date for the 15th General Election (GE15)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno’s top five refers to its president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan and the three vice-presidents, Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin, Datuk Seri Mahdzir Khalid and Ismail Sabri himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “That’s the procedure that needs to be observed,” he said in his speech at the presentation of the 2022 allocation for the Chinese and Indian communities in the Bera parliamentary constituency at Bera Umno Complex in Padang Luas here today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Ismail Sabri told BN leaders in the Bera parliamentary constituency to be ready with their election machinery and to meet with the voters to maintain the coalition’s victory in Bera and the Guai and Kemayan state seats, and recapture the Triang state seat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri said in Bera, the BN machinery should work hard not only to maintain the parliamentary and the Guai and Kemayan state seats, but also to win back the Triang state seat from DAP
            </p>

                Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, has announced that the new living allowance rate for local students has been increased from a minimum of RM650 to a maximum of RM950 per month from diploma to professional and doctoral degree levels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The living allowance was used towards accommodation, food, transportation, and daily needs, he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the existing allowance rate had been used for over 13 years and there was a need to review it following the increase in the cost of living in the country over the past 10 years, the coronavirus pandemic and other issues
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is between 60 and 70% of the allowance received by each student,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the living allowance for Mara and JPA students, such as in London, was £1,045 or RM5,712, much lower than the UK government’s recommended median of £1,312 or RM7,172 as of September 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When met by reporters after the ceremony, Ismail Sabri said he had instructed the JPA to also review the living allowance rates for JPA-sponsored students.

                There is a recognition things have to change, with Klopp admitting the team need to 'reinvent themselves'
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, he is still not close to being fired

            <p>
                There's no question of Liverpool being unlucky so far this season - even Klopp himself admits things need to improve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's meant the likes of teenager Harvey Elliott, 19, and veteran James Milner, 36, getting more game time than perhaps Klopp would like
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp has the latter and will almost certainly be allowed the former

            <p>
                Klopp will certainly hope so.

                There is a recognition things have to change, with Klopp admitting the team need to 'reinvent themselves'

                First, he is still not close to being fired

            <p>
                There's no question of Liverpool being unlucky so far this season - even Klopp himself admits things need to improve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's meant the likes of teenager Harvey Elliott, 19, and veteran James Milner, 36, getting more game time than perhaps Klopp would like
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp has the latter and will almost certainly be allowed the former
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp will certainly hope so.

                Britain's King Charles III during his first audience with Prime Minister Liz Truss at Buckingham Palace, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday, in London, Britain September 9, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Truss, who was appointed prime minister by Elizabeth on Tuesday in her last public act, was one of several senior lawmakers who swore a new oath of allegiance to the new king in a special session in parliament earlier on Saturday following the queen's death
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She was also present, along with six former prime ministers, senior bishops and several politicians, when Charles, 73, was officially proclaimed Britain's new king in a colourful ceremony laden with pageantry and tradition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She later met Charles along with other senior ministers at Buckingham Palace
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In terms of the prime minister's involvement, she will join the king as he leads the national mourning across the United Kingdom, attending services of reflection in Scotland on Monday afternoon, in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, and Wales on Friday," the spokesman told reporters

                Britain's William, Prince of Wales, Catherine, Princess of Wales, Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, walk outside Windsor Castle, following the passing of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, in Windsor, Britain, September 10, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The couple had been in Britain on a brief visit when the queen, Britain's longest reigning monarch, died on Thursday

            <p>
                Like other senior members of the royal family, Harry rushed to be by the queen's side as she deteriorated at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and a spokesperson for the heir to the throne said an invitation for the Windsor walk had been extended by William

            <p>
                William spent some time bending down chatting to children, while Kate and Harry accepted flowers and messages of encouragement from those in the crowd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                William was heard telling one well-wisher that the days following the queen's death had been "so surreal"
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA KANGSAR, Sept 11 — A vintage bread and coffee shop that is over 80 years old, still remains to be popular among youngsters here, despite the huge number of hipster cafes mushrooming everywhere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Located in Perak’s royal town, this shop has been the preferred choice of local and foreign visitors who come here specially to enjoy its home-made bread and delicious ‘kaw’ coffee, amid the warm and rusty ambience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to manager Leong Tean Chia, 60, the shop where Double Lion Restaurant had been operating has remained until today because the building materials used then were of high quality and the furniture were built to last

            <p>
                Leong added that another factor why the restaurant is still in business today is because the quality of its home-made bread has remained consistent until today using the same recipe which has been passed down through generations

                Britain's King Charles III before Privy Council members in the Throne Room during the Accession Council at St James's Palace, London, Saturday, Sept

            <p>
                In Britain, people started gathering outside royal palaces in the early hours of Saturday morning, with thousands flocking to Buckingham Palace to pay respects to the queen and Charles - who was proclaimed king at the nearby St James's Palace
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "(We're) here to be part of that and show respect to the late queen and also to the new king." Charles is king and head of state of the United Kingdom and 14 other realms including Australia, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Charles' coronation as king will take place at a later date - and the timing for that is not yet clear

            <p>
                The new king vowed on Friday to serve the nation with "loyalty, respect and love" in his first address to the nation as king

                Noting criticism of the Federal Court’s decision last month to uphold the conviction of former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, she said the reasons for doing so were clearly laid out in the written judgment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It can be said that all these are based on mere sentiments without any basis or understanding of the laws or the grounds for judgement itself.” “They did not fully understand the court’s decision,” she said when asked to comment on the criticisms against the courts following the August 23 court decision to uphold Najib’s conviction and sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment along with a RM210 million fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In that matter, Tengku Maimun chaired a five-judge Federal Court panel that dismissed Najib’s final appeal against his SRC International Sdn Bhd graft conviction

            <p>

                Noting criticism of the Federal Court’s decision last month to uphold the conviction of former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, she said the reasons for doing so were clearly laid out in the written judgment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It can be said that all these are based on mere sentiments without any basis or understanding of the laws or the grounds for judgement itself.” “They did not fully understand the court’s decision,” she said when asked to comment on the criticisms against the courts following the August 23 court decision to uphold Najib’s conviction and sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment along with a RM210 million fine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In that matter, Tengku Maimun chaired a five-judge Federal Court panel that dismissed Najib’s final appeal against his SRC International Sdn Bhd graft conviction

            <p>
                ROYAL POMP Charles is the 41st monarch in a line that traces its origins to the Norman King William the Conqueror who captured the English throne in 1066
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was the first proclamation of a monarch to be televised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Charles himself was just 3 when she became queen in 1952
            </p>

                Britain has declared a period of mourning until the state funeral for Elizabeth, which will be a public holiday
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Following a 4-0 defeat to Udinese in Serie A last weekend, Roma began their Europa League campaign with a 2-1 loss to Ludogorets in Bulgaria on Thursday.  The team have shown the same problems that the Portuguese coach inherited from his predecessor Paulo Fonseca.  Mourinho is well aware of the fickleness of Italian football fans and in particular of Roma fans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking to Sky Sports after the Europa League defeat, Mourinho showed his usual defensive attitude, denying the team's unresolved problems.  'I'm not saying we played well because it's not true, but it was a performance sufficient to win or at least not to lose,' he said
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                But this was a second defeat in four days and called in to question Mourinho's ability to motivate his players.  There are Mourinho murals in the popular neighbourhoods of Rome, showing his popularity It is difficult to imagine a coach so experienced who cannot understand the reasons for two poor results and now the fans are asking Mourinho to find a solution to avoid yet another disappointing season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without the injured Abraham, the team look lost in attack.  Inter Milan tried to sign Dybala from Juventus in the summer, but Mourinho always had hope of bringing the scarred Argentine gladiator to the city of the Colosseum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His transfer to Roma was perhaps the most interesting in Serie A this summer as he downgraded from a team in the Champions League to a side in the Europa League

                Without naming the religious minister, Azalina questioned the precedent Idris would be setting by silencing and downplaying the child victim's allegations, especially with several Acts already in place that were designed to help and protect victims of sexual abuse
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What now of our newly-passed Anti-Sexual Harassment Act or the Child Act or the Sexual Offences Against Children Act? "What kind of messaging and precedent are we setting? Using religion especially to create fear, shame, and obligation to protect the reputation of a sexual predator is against every rule of protective laws for children in this country," she said in a statement today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former law minister then said that Idris' remarks proved that the system is failing to protect vulnerable children, adding that no amount of reputation laundering can erase the trauma experienced by any victim, especially a child
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Yesterday, the JAG condemned the victim-blaming and silencing by Idris, after a child survivor spoke up about the abuse she endured at the hands of her father on a YouTube podcast

                The prime minister's first meeting with the new monarch came after Charles returned to London, from Scotland, to cheering crowds outside Buckingham Palace who had come to pay their respects to the queen

                Counsel Alan Adrian Gomez, representing Thomas, said the lawsuit filed by Najib was an abuse of the court process and cannot be relied on because the four criminal trials are a type of proceedings that can be determined in Najib’s favour

            <p>
                The man allegedly deceived Datin Seri Alauyah Jaafar, 58, by tricking the victim into a unit trust investment promising high returns, which prompted the victim to hand over a RM150,000 cheque made to the account of the accused's company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court allowed bail at RM25,000 with one guarantor and set Oct 12 for re-mention of the case

                In some ways, Joe Gomez has made life simpler for Jürgen Klopp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Matip started against Fulham on the opening day of the season but he then damaged his groin, and that enabled Gomez to rekindle his partnership with Van Dijk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Again, you got the sense that, based on precedent, it was now Gomez’s place to lose
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gomez, his confidence visibly damaged, wouldn’t re-emerge for the second half
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp hooked him — and this was as blatant a hooking as you’ll see — at half-time and sent on Matip in his place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As Liverpool look to get back on track, it's time for Matip to step up.

                In some ways, Joe Gomez has made life simpler for Jürgen Klopp
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Matip started against Fulham on the opening day of the season but he then damaged his groin, and that enabled Gomez to rekindle his partnership with Van Dijk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Again, you got the sense that, based on precedent, it was now Gomez’s place to lose
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gomez, his confidence visibly damaged, wouldn’t re-emerge for the second half
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Klopp hooked him — and this was as blatant a hooking as you’ll see — at half-time and sent on Matip in his place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As Liverpool look to get back on track, it's time for Matip to step up.

                About Us Advertise PARIS, Sept 9 — Manchester United kicked off their Europa League campaign poorly with a 1-0 home defeat by Real Sociedad as Arsenal’s new signing Marquinhos scored in a 2-1 win at FC Zurich on Thursday

            <p>
                At Old Trafford, United pinned Real Sociedad in their own half, with Christian Eriksen finding spaces for Anthony Elanga and Ronaldo but the Spanish side held on thanks to their centre backs

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 8 — Retired top judge Tun Abdul Hamid Mohamad has indicated that Malaysia’s legal and judicial systems would become an international laughing stock if convicted former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak were to receive a pardon, Utusan Malaysia reported today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former chief justice from 2007 to 2008 noted that the Federal Constitution is silent on the grounds for a convicted criminal to receive a pardon, but added that the 2018 full pardon granted to PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has set a precedent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The case of Pakatan Harapan chairman Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has changed that practice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The grounds for Anwar to get a pardon was only political,” Abdul Hamid was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the question on whether or not Najib should receive a pardon has been politicised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A royal pardon falls under Article 42(1) of the Federal Constitution, which gives the Agong or Sultan the powers to grant a pardon or reprieve to a convict.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 8 — Retired top judge Tun Abdul Hamid Mohamad has indicated that Malaysia’s legal and judicial systems would become an international laughing stock if convicted former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak were to receive a pardon, Utusan Malaysia reported today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The former chief justice from 2007 to 2008 noted that the Federal Constitution is silent on the grounds for a convicted criminal to receive a pardon, but added that the 2018 full pardon granted to PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has set a precedent
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The case of Pakatan Harapan chairman Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has changed that practice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The grounds for Anwar to get a pardon was only political,” Abdul Hamid was quoted as saying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that the question on whether or not Najib should receive a pardon has been politicised
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A royal pardon falls under Article 42(1) of the Federal Constitution, which gives the Agong or Sultan the powers to grant a pardon or reprieve to a convict.

                Liverpool were in action in the Champions League on Wednesday, but the previous night’s games had points of interest too, not least the ‘next Erling Haaland’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was his fifth goal in 10 games this season — not up there with Haaland numbers, but a strong tally all the same

            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! But the Salzburg talent production factory is relentless, and Liverpool could be forgiven for wanting to use their strong relationship with Red Bull to get in on the ground floor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Okafor, they would be getting a forward with more versatility than Haaland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool would no doubt have to pay more than £16.2m to land Okafor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stylistically, he may not quite be the next Haaland — but Liverpool would not want that, having already moved for Núñez

                Liverpool were in action in the Champions League on Wednesday, but the previous night’s games had points of interest too, not least the ‘next Erling Haaland’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was his fifth goal in 10 games this season — not up there with Haaland numbers, but a strong tally all the same
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! But the Salzburg talent production factory is relentless, and Liverpool could be forgiven for wanting to use their strong relationship with Red Bull to get in on the ground floor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Okafor, they would be getting a forward with more versatility than Haaland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool would no doubt have to pay more than £16.2m to land Okafor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stylistically, he may not quite be the next Haaland — but Liverpool would not want that, having already moved for Núñez
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                He would be entitled to participate in parliamentary debates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision of the Speaker recognising his valid status as MP would be fruitless if Najib elects not to carry out such official duties as MP
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all he is paid to do the lawful job
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The second scenario would be his decision to go to his parliamentary constituency in Pekan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Can he go there without wearing his official prison outfit and without his hands being cuffed? Yes, the whole world would be utterly excited to witness such a "wonderful" and historical scene! Can we imagine the massive influx of trolls by netizens against him thereafter? Najib may still remain as a lawful MP in the eyes of law

                Fans travelling to the 2022 World Cup will not be able to take alcohol for personal consumption into Qatar, with the head of the country's safety and security committee saying that "specific measures" are in place to take action against anyone attempting to smuggle liquor in their luggage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But despite football fan culture in many regions of the world involving alcohol consumption before, during and after games, the Qatari authorities have said that alcohol availability will be limited to designated areas only and that fans will not be allowed to bring their own booze
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I think alcohol will not be allowed through the airport and suitcases
            </p>

            <p>

                Fans travelling to the 2022 World Cup will not be able to take alcohol for personal consumption into Qatar, with the head of the country's safety and security committee saying that "specific measures" are in place to take action against anyone attempting to smuggle liquor in their luggage

            <p>
                But despite football fan culture in many regions of the world involving alcohol consumption before, during and after games, the Qatari authorities have said that alcohol availability will be limited to designated areas only and that fans will not be allowed to bring their own booze

                Talented winger Ronaldo broke through at the Portuguese club as a teenager (pictured) The Romanian elevated the teenager through the ranks, making him the first player to represent the club's Under-16, U17 and U18 sides, as well as the B team and first team, all in the same season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before his league bow, though, he was thrown into the first-team squad for two matches in the UEFA Cup, now known as the Europa League, arguably helping to launch his senior career.  What happened in the first leg?  Sporting were drawn against Serbian side Partizan Belgrade in the first round, and the first leg, in the Portuguese capital, saw Ronaldo named on the bench, with fellow skilful winger Ricardo Quaresma in the starting line-up

                So after the transfer window closed earlier this month, it appears Ronaldo will be forced to stay at least until January, raising the prospect of another Europa League appearance 20 years after his first steps in the competition.  Ronaldo announced his desire to leave this summer because he wanted Champions League football - now he might be forced to compete in the Europa League, starting on Thursday night Thursday preview  Dropped after the club's 4-0 humbling against Brentford, Ronaldo now appears to be second-choice up front, with Marcus Rashford preferred after his resurgence amid Ten Hag's desire for pace, mobility and a pressing forward up top
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo, therefore, short of match sharpness, could well be used to spearhead the United attack against Real Sociedad at Old Trafford on Thursday evening

                central bank's fight to cool down red-hot inflation, possibly laying the rhetorical groundwork for another large interest rate rise later this month

                "The longer inflation remains above [the Fed's 2%] target, the greater the risk that the public does begin to see higher inflation as the norm, and that has the capacity to really raise the cost of getting inflation down," Powell said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His comments come after Fed vice chair Lael Brainard said on Wednesday that the central bank was dedicated to battling inflation "for as long as it takes." The Fed has already raised borrowing costs by 225 basis points since March

                2-Year Treasury Yield, which is highly sensitive to short-term interest rate changes, rose to as high as 3.49% as Powell delivered his remarks, while stock indices on Wall Street traded in the red

                His comments come after Fed vice chair Lael Brainard said on Wednesday that the central bank was dedicated to battling inflation "for as long as it takes." The Fed has already raised borrowing costs by 225 basis points since March

                Thirdly, there is Zahid's inability to clear himself of major responsibility for the RM9 billion littoral combatant ships (LCS) scandal, and his attempt to blame Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein, his successor as the defence minister, for the LCS scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid has denied that he was responsible for the RM9 billion LCS scandal, and said it was unreasonable to pin the failure of the LCS procurement on him, as he was not the defence minister when the project was awarded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Zahid held the defence minister position from April 2009 to May 2013, and was succeeded by Hishammuddin, and the contract was delayed and only signed on July 17, 2014, the two declassified reports on the LCS scandal, despite being heavily redacted, showed that it is Zahid who must bear greater responsibility than Hishammuddin for the LCS scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, between the issue of the LOA and the signing of the contract, there were 21 LOAs worth some RM5 billion to procure equipments and systems, most of which were made when Zahid was the defence minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the LOAs made during the time Hishammuddin became the defence minister after the 13th general election did not reach RM700 million, Zahid must bear greater responsibility than Hishammuddin for the LCS scandal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lastly, Zahid failed to state clearly and specifically that Najib, as the then prime minister and finance minister, was not responsible for the RM9 billion LCS scandal, especially as the LCS procurement went back to when Najib was the defence minister in the Cabinet of Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ziyech, James and Mason Mount all stood over the ball as the hosts prepared their wall

            <p>
                Just moments before, flop forward Ziyech had already sent a free-kick crashing into his opponents
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Predictably, Ziyech’s free-kick was as poor as his last as the ball hit the wall yet again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And supporters took to Twitter to express their anger at Ziyech’s refusal to let James take the late free-kick

                Wednesday, 07 Sep 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the high court decision in Sep 2021, a few mothers were successful in getting citizenships for their children born abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision, says the UN in a press statement released on Sept 5, contravenes Malaysia’s obligations under international law and "the need to interpret all constitutional provisions concerning citizenship, and its transference, without discrimination based on sex"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In August 2022, the Court of Appeal overturned a landmark 2021 High Court ruling which would have allowed Malaysian mothers married to foreign spouses the right to pass down citizenship to children born abroad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When children of Malaysian descent are banned from being part of society based on a discriminatory interpretation of the law, it does not only negatively impact them, but the community and State lose the opportunity to thrive socially, politically and economically." On Sep 9, 2021, the High Court ruled that the word “father” in paragraphs 1(b) and 1(c) of Part II of Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution shall be interpreted harmoniously to include “mother” and that overseas-born children of Malaysian women are citizens by “operation of law." However, on 5 August 2022, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Government’s appeal, declaring that the relevant provisions of the Constitution specifically refer to the “biological father” and cannot be extended to mean the “mother." “We regret that the Malaysian Government is responsible for this setback instead of seizing an opportunity to make progress towards the realisation of gender equality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We call on the Government to fulfil its obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child by interpreting the law to ensure there is no contradiction between Article 14(1)b and Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution, as amended by Parliament to prohibit discrimination against citizens based on descent, place of birth or gender in any law,” the UN experts said.

                People with more than US$1 million of investable funds are repositioning toward private markets to shield their assets from market volatility, Lombard Odier’s 2022 study about high net-worth individuals in Asia Pacific found
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The surge in inflation and its repercussions on the global economy are the biggest concern for 77% of the people polled, Lombard Odier said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Half of them are worried about market volatility, which has pushed as much as 56% of them to increase diversification
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The rich in Singapore and Australia are leading the trend, with about 60% of them planning to increase their allocations to private markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The concern of lack of visibility, volatility and the willingness to manage it are homogeneous across the markets and across age brackets,” said Jean-Francois Aboulker, the bank’s Asia head of ultra-high net-worth individuals.

                On Sunday (Sept 4), Bernama reported that a Malaysian couple who went to Bangkok to look for their missing son were heartbroken upon finding out that he had passed away on May 11 at Mae Sot Hospital near the Thailand-Myanmar border
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The couple travelled to Bangkok on Aug 30 and were scheduled to fly to Mae Sot the next day to meet their son, who was said to be sick and receiving treatment at the hospital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, they were told that Zhan Feng had actually passed away 2am on May 11 and doctors believed that the victim was abused before being left at the hospital on April 11
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On March 31, Zhan Feng called his parents and informed them that he was in Mae Sot in Tak Province and that he needed RM80,000 for medical treatment; that was the last time the parents heard from him

                Judge Zaini said it would be better for him to only decide on Arul Kanda’s status when both the prosecution and the defence have presented their submissions or arguments at the end of the prosecution’s case, as he will have to weigh Arul Kanda’s testimony against all other evidence by the prosecution

                Zaini confirmed to Sivananthan that he would decide on Arul Kanda’s status when he makes a ruling on whether the prosecution has proved a prima facie case and whether Najib would need to enter defence

            <p>
                Sivananthan also told the High Court that he would only be presenting submissions on whether a certificate of indemnity should be issued for Arul Kanda following his testimony as a prosecution witness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The last two prosecution witnesses to testify in the trial today were Najib’s former principal private secretary Tan Sri Shukry Salleh who was the 11th prosecution witness, and Arul Kanda who was briefly recalled as the 15th prosecution witness to identify signatures on three documents that had not been available previously when he was testifying in court.

                Todd Boehly began his 100th day as the co-owner of the club by calling Thomas Tuchel in for a meeting just hours after his 100th game in charge

            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Thomas will rightly have a place in Chelsea’s history after winning the Champions League, the Super Cup and Club World Cup in his time here.“As the new ownership group reaches 100 days since taking over the club, and as it continues its hard work to take the club forward, the new owners believe it is the right time to make this transition."Yet it is less than a week since they finished backing the German in the summer transfer market to the record level of £273m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was an increasingly open secret that Tuchel’s tenure at the club may not have time to run

                Todd Boehly began his 100th day as the co-owner of the club by calling Thomas Tuchel in for a meeting just hours after his 100th game in charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, his day took a different turn
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After a brief personal meeting with the owners, he was suddenly out of work.“The club would like to place on record its gratitude to Thomas and his staff for all their efforts during their time with the club,” a pre-prepared public announcement declared just minutes later
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Thomas will rightly have a place in Chelsea’s history after winning the Champions League, the Super Cup and Club World Cup in his time here.“As the new ownership group reaches 100 days since taking over the club, and as it continues its hard work to take the club forward, the new owners believe it is the right time to make this transition."Yet it is less than a week since they finished backing the German in the summer transfer market to the record level of £273m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was an increasingly open secret that Tuchel’s tenure at the club may not have time to run

                Raja Rozela also told Justice Mohd Yazid Mustafa that Ahmd Zahid had no business seeking funds under the pretense it was meant for his political activities

                She also reminded the court how one of the UKSB directors, Tan, had said in his testimony that he had personally delivered RM3mil cash in a trolley bag to Ahmad Zahid

            <p>

                Raja Rozela also told Justice Mohd Yazid Mustafa that Ahmd Zahid had no business seeking funds under the pretense it was meant for his political activities
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She also reminded the court how one of the UKSB directors, Tan, had said in his testimony that he had personally delivered RM3mil cash in a trolley bag to Ahmad Zahid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said UKSB directors Tan, Lee and Wan Quoris Shah Wan Abdul Ghani, who were prosecution witnesses, had also testified that the money given to Ahmad Zahid was meant for Umno
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hisyam reiterated that Ahmad Zahid was a victim of selective prosecution as other notable and key figures who had allegedly also received funds from UKSB had not been hauled up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zaidi Zainal, who is also on Ahmad Zahid’s defence team, said although it was stated that the money was from UKSB, the prosecution did not prove where the funds came from in all the charges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier in her submission, Raja Rozela said it did not matter where the money came from as the crux was that the funds were given to Ahmad Zahid by UKSB directors

                Initially, Ten Hag's focus will be on finishing as high up the Premier League table as possible, but he will know that the prize at the end of the Europa League -- a trophy and an automatic place in next season's Champions League group stage as a top seed -- is too good an opportunity to throw away

                Nissan says the seven-seat version has a third row that can accommodate passengers up to 160 cm in height comfortably, or they can be folded down to allow for more cargo space

            <p>

            <p>
                "I also confirm that I have never seen the joint venture agreement document between 1MDB and Aabar Investment BVI Co, which is in their LOS application to the government to secure the US$3bil loan," she said when cross-examined by lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed who was representing former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak at the trial involving the misappropriation of RM2.3bil from 1MDB

                Asked if she had seen any document showing that 1MDB failed to make repayments causing the government to bear the debt, Siti Zauyah replied "I don't remember..there must be some evidence, that's why I said that in my witness statement"

                On Sunday, Khairy confirmed that Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan, who is the Rembau Umno division chief, has asked him to make way

                My job is to be wherever my clients want me to be and to do nothing in particular," Morimoto told Reuters, adding that he had handled some 4,000 sessions in the past four years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Doing nothing doesn't mean Morimoto will do anything

                Before Morimoto found his true calling, he worked at a publishing company and was often chided for "doing nothing"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As he spent a Wednesday doing nothing of note in Tokyo, Morimoto reflected on the bizarre nature of his job and appeared to question a society that values productivity and derides uselessness

                Wan Junaidi told English daily The Star that judges will be given the discretion to hand down the two sentences instead if the amendments are passed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If everything goes well and there are no disruptions to the coming Budget session, we will no longer have the mandatory death sentence in 2023,” said Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Junaidi said he intended to table the proposed amendments during the Parliament meeting that begins on October 3
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The amendments on the mandatory death sentences will cover amendments to 33 sections under the law and involve mandatory death sentences for 11 offences,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On whipping, Wan Junaidi said the proposed amendments would not do away with the punishment, but again give judges the discretion on whether to impose it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The abolition of the mandatory death sentence was first raised by the Pakatan Harapan administration in 2018 and a moratorium on execution was then implemented.

                Liz Truss gestures outside the Conservative Party headquarters, after being announced as Britain's next Prime Minister, in London, Britain September 5, 2022

            <p>
                Long the front-runner to replace him, Truss will become the Conservatives' fourth prime minister in seven years

                Although Britain is well-versed in choosing - and replacing - prime ministers, the choreography of the day will have an unfamiliar feel, with Queen Elizabeth meeting Johnson and Truss in Balmoral rather than Buckingham Palace

                The palace announced last week that the queen would appoint the new prime minister in Balmoral, where she spends her summers, due to mobility issues

                This week, it appears that a database allegedly containing 45 million customers of Malindo Air (now known as Batik Air) has been leaked online through a platform that’s associated with selling personal data
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As spotted by @xanda, an online individual claims to have records of Malindo Air passengers which were obtained from a data breach back in March 2019

            <p>
                From the sample data, it doesn’t seem to be a clean list as there’s a lot of dummy data and what appear to be duplicated records
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We reported the Malindo Air data breach incident back in September 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malindo Air said the incident is not related to the security of its data architecture and none of the payment details of customers was compromised

            <p>
                Malindo Air has recently completed its rebranding to Batik Air to establish a common identity for full-service airlines within the Lion group

                Erik ten Hag's Manchester United now sit fifth in the Premier League after their woeful start RUNNING MEN The most damning aspect of United’s wretched start to the season was the fact Ten Hag’s side ran eight-and-a-half miles less than Brentford as they were humiliated 4-0

                Last term, Martinez, who was playing for Ajax in the Eredivisie, and Maguire were on a par and both won seven out of ten aerial duels throughout the season

                Souness is not the first person to doubt Martinez' ability in the air
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Martinez has proved to be an aggressive defender and fans have warmed to him quickly Martinez excelled in the Champions League against Haaland, snuffing out Dortmund  attacks  Souness suggests that Martinez will eventually be found out

            <p>
                The defender had no problems against Haaland in the Champions League last season

                During 11 seasons, which brought six Premier League titles, Rio Ferdinand won 315 of his 493 aerial battles in the top flight, a win percentage of 64 per cent, while his defensive partner, Nemanja Vidic won 707 out of 962 aerial duels in the league, or 73 per cent, on his way to five championships

                “To insinuate or make a comparison to Nelson Mandela shows that Nizar may not understand the anti-racism struggle of Mandela compared to Malaysian policies which are still race-based,” he said, adding that it seemed Nizar was living in another universe

                This was after High Court judge, Datuk Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid allowed the Attorney General's Chambers' (AGC) objection to the leave application for a judicial review filed by Emilia, 43, as the applicant

                Federal counsel Mohammad Sallehuddin Md Ali, representing the AGC, said the court ruled that the Syariah Court has the jurisdiction to initiate committal proceedings as enshrined in the Administration of Islamic Law (Federal Territories) Act 1993 and the Syariah Court Civil Procedure (Federal Territories) Act 1998

                According to Mohammad Sallehuddin, the court also found that the leave for judicial review was filed outside the set period, as the Syariah Court's decision on the committal order was made on Feb 9, whereas Emilia filed her application on June 8
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the judicial review application, Emilia did not live or reside in the Federal Territory when the hadhanah (custody) proceeding was filed at the Kuala Lumpur Syariah High Court on July 23, 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Emilia sought a declaration that the Kuala Lumpur Syariah High Court and Syariah Court of Appeal do not have jurisdiction to hear and punish any individual who contravenes the court, as it is the exclusive right of the civil courts at the Federal Court, Court of Appeal and High Court levels, according to Article 126 of the Federal Constitution

                While being cross-examined today by Najib’s lawyer, Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed, on documents from between 2009 and 2013, Siti Zauyah also took often long pauses before answering questions, frequently flipping through documentary evidence placed before her

                If it wasn't working, he cut you.  Since taking charge, Ten Hag has made the decision to bench Cristiano Ronaldo (left) Burley claimed that Ten Hag's ruthless mentality allowed him to make those key choices 'For me that is one of the big success stories in Dutch football is when it's not working for them generally their managers are very ruthless, they will make decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And he [Ten Hag] has already shown it, but I don't think it was ever in doubt that he was going to make decisions.' However, Burley's co-pundit Shaka Hislop did not have the same confidence in Ten Hag.  He previously claimed that he did not believe the Red Devils boss had what it takes to turn United's fortunes around but he admitted that he had been proven wrong by Ten Hag's start to life at Old Trafford.  'Credit to Erik ten Hag,' Hislop said

                If it wasn't working, he cut you.  Since taking charge, Ten Hag has made the decision to bench Cristiano Ronaldo (left) Burley claimed that Ten Hag's ruthless mentality allowed him to make those key choices 'For me that is one of the big success stories in Dutch football is when it's not working for them generally their managers are very ruthless, they will make decisions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And he [Ten Hag] has already shown it, but I don't think it was ever in doubt that he was going to make decisions.' However, Burley's co-pundit Shaka Hislop did not have the same confidence in Ten Hag.  He previously claimed that he did not believe the Red Devils boss had what it takes to turn United's fortunes around but he admitted that he had been proven wrong by Ten Hag's start to life at Old Trafford.  'Credit to Erik ten Hag,' Hislop said

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, Sept 5 — Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi cannot use selective prosecution as a defence in his bribery case in connection to the government’s award of a foreign visa system (VLN) contract since an acquittal will be solely based on facts and evidence, the High Court heard today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In their submission following the close of the prosecution’s case, deputy public prosecutor Zander Lim Wei Keong sought to counter the use of selective enforcement and prosecution as a legal defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We submit that the failure to charge the other politicians, if at all there was a need to do so, does not constitute a legal defence for the accused to rebut its criminal charges against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He presented his reasoning for rejecting Ahmad Zahid’s lawyers arguments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim said Ahmad Zahid’s constitutional rights under Article 5 and 8 of the Federal Constitution had not been violated as claimed by the defence in their argument
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We submit in negative in light that the accused is represented by a very competent legal team; is given the right to cross-examine all witnesses and to put their defence during the prosecution’s case; given reasonable time frame to file written submissions; given the right to submit their defence orally at the close of the prosecution’s case and for the case to be heard before an impartial judge,” the DPP said

                About Us Advertise SHAH ALAM, Sept 5 — Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi cannot use selective prosecution as a defence in his bribery case in connection to the government’s award of a foreign visa system (VLN) contract since an acquittal will be solely based on facts and evidence, the High Court heard today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In their submission following the close of the prosecution’s case, deputy public prosecutor Zander Lim Wei Keong sought to counter the use of selective enforcement and prosecution as a legal defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We submit that the failure to charge the other politicians, if at all there was a need to do so, does not constitute a legal defence for the accused to rebut its criminal charges against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He presented his reasoning for rejecting Ahmad Zahid’s lawyers arguments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim said Ahmad Zahid’s constitutional rights under Article 5 and 8 of the Federal Constitution had not been violated as claimed by the defence in their argument
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We submit in negative in light that the accused is represented by a very competent legal team; is given the right to cross-examine all witnesses and to put their defence during the prosecution’s case; given reasonable time frame to file written submissions; given the right to submit their defence orally at the close of the prosecution’s case and for the case to be heard before an impartial judge,” the DPP said

                Conservative leadership candidate Liz Truss arrives at Broadcasting House ahead of her appearance on BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show in London, Britain September 4, 2022

                Foreign minister under Boris Johnson, Truss, 47, has promised to act quickly to tackle Britain's cost of living crisis, saying that within a week she will come up with a plan to tackle rising energy bills and securing future fuel supplies

                'SECOND MOST DIFFICULT POST-WAR BRIEF' Truss faces a long, costly and difficult to-do list, which opposition lawmakers say is the result of 12 years of poor Conservative government

            <p>
                Veteran Conservative lawmaker David Davis described the challenges she would take on as prime minister as "probably the second most difficult brief of post-war prime ministers" after Conservative Margaret Thatcher in 1979
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In May, the government set out a 15-billion-pound support package to help households with energy bills as part of its 37-billion-pound cost-of-living support scheme

                Any responsible political party must, if it wants to be recognised as a party capable of governing a country, accept and protect the judicial system of the country

            <p>
                I really hope the rakyat will rise up again and vote out more of these political ‘clowns’ once and for all to cleanse this country Currently, Umno has 38 seats, 37 if minus jailed former premier Najib Abdul Razak

            <p>

                Umno must be defeated in the next election, or else we may not have a country left

            <p>
                If Umno have any sense left, they should have sacked Najib from the day he was convicted by the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, Umno treated this felon as a hero to be worshipped at any cost

                Rahmat Mohamed Hazlan, one of their lawyers, when contacted on Monday (Sept 5), confirmed the court has fixed for further case management for the appeal as the records of appeal are not ready
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The appeal was set for case management today before Court of Appeal deputy registrar Tan Chai Wei

            <p>
                On June 21, this year, the Shah Alam High Court had acquitted and discharged Samirah, 47, who is Nazrin's widow and the two teenagers aged 19 and 16 after finding that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against the trio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On June 23, this year, the Attorney General's Chambers filed its notice of appeal against the High Court's decision to acquit Samirah and the teenagers on the murder charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, on June 30 this year, Samirah and the teenagers also filed an appeal to challenge certain finding of facts by the High Court including the findings that the fire which broke out in Nazrin's room was "done deliberately"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court judge, in his oral judgment, had said the court accepted the testimonies of the Kuala Lumpur fire and rescue department director Edwin Galan Teruki and investigating officer Halim Zulkefeli, in which they concluded that the fire was deliberately lit

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 5 — PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang was the very reason why his party was not making headway outside of Malay-Muslim constituencies, DAP’s Lim Kit Siang said today

                Lim again challenged Hadi, who is the prime minister’s special envoy to the Middle East, to deny if he was banned from visiting Saudi Arabia and possibly other countries in the region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On August 20, Abdul Hadi accused non-Muslims and non-Bumiputera of being the “roots of corruption” in the country on his Facebook page

                Lim previously questioned if Abdul Hadi had been barred from Saudi Arabia last year following the latter’s absence from the entourage during then-prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin’s visit to the kingdom and the United Arab Emirates

            <p>
                While Saudi Arabia has not made any announcement specifically about Hadi, the kingdom along with several other Arab countries previously listed the International Union of Muslim Scholars (IUMS) group as a terrorist organisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hadi is a vice-president of the IUMS and an active contributor to the group’s discourse.

                MANCHESTER UNITED fans were convinced that Arsenal star Albert Sambi Lokonga should have seen red for his tackle on Bruno Fernandes

            <p>
                But it was soon the United supporters that were left raging after Belgian midfielder Lokonga, 22, caught Fernandes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fortunately for Fernandes he was able to continue, but the referee failed to dish out any punishment to Lokonga

                MANCHESTER UNITED fans were convinced that Arsenal star Albert Sambi Lokonga should have seen red for his tackle on Bruno Fernandes

            <p>
                📸 - Rough challenge on Bruno Fernandes from Lokonga but no card
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it was soon the United supporters that were left raging after Belgian midfielder Lokonga, 22, caught Fernandes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fortunately for Fernandes he was able to continue, but the referee failed to dish out any punishment to Lokonga

                United, who posted a fourth successive Premier League win for the first time since April 2021 with a 3-1 triumph over table-toppers Arsenal on Sunday afternoon, were cut to pieces by the Bees in just their second game of the season

            <p>
                United, of course, won that game 2-1 and have won every game since being blown away by Thomas Frank's side, with the win over Arsenal their latest triumph

            <p>

                United, who posted a fourth successive Premier League win for the first time since April 2021 with a 3-1 triumph over table-toppers Arsenal on Sunday afternoon, were cut to pieces by the Bees in just their second game of the season

            <p>
                United, of course, won that game 2-1 and have won every game since being blown away by Thomas Frank's side, with the win over Arsenal their latest triumph

                Man Utd renew their rivalries with Arsenal this weekend as they attempt to halt the Gunners' flawless start to the new campaign and the Red Devils could certainly do with an infamous Sir Alex Ferguson speech to help them towards victory  In-form Manchester United welcome Arsenal on Sunday aiming to secure their fourth consecutive Premier League victory
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the more famous matches between the Red Devils and the Gunners was arguably the 1999 FA Cup replay at Villa Park - a game made famous by Ryan Giggs’ stunning solo goal to book United’s place in the final of the competition  Whilst many will have seen the Welshman’s strike on many occasions since that showdown, some might not know how Sir Alex Ferguson managed to get his side motivated for the game with his pre-match speech to the entire United squad

                All of the Man United players say the same." Sir Alex’s infamous teamtalk certainly appeared to work as the Red Devils edged out Arsenal to book a place in the final and they would eventually go on to lift the trophy - the first part of an unprecedented treble
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It remains to be seen whether Ten Hag attempts to emulate the legendary United manager but it certainly wouldn’t be the most unwise action to take as the Red Devils try to topple the Gunners once more

                About Us Advertise VATICAN CITY, Sept 4 — Thousands of people are expected to gather in St Peter's Square today as Pope Francis presides over the beatification of John Paul I, the so-called "Smiling Pope" who led the Catholic Church for just 33 days before dying in contested circumstances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                John Paul I, the son of a bricklayer from the Dolomite mountains and a particularly warm and pastoral figure, was elected pope on August 26, 1978, at the age of 65
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His death sparked intense speculation as to the cause, from suicide — he seemed reluctant to take on the position of pope — to murder, allegedly by those who opposed his plans to reform the church, particularly the powerful Vatican bank
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Born on October 17, 1912, in the northern Italian town of Canale d'Agordo, John Paul I rose to become Patriarch of Venice, Cardinal and then head of the Catholic Church
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Among the most recent popes, John XXIII (1958-1963), Paul VI (1963-1978) and John Paul II (1978-2005) were proclaimed saints
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The predecessor of Pope Francis, Benedict XVI, is still alive and living in the Vatican after resigning in 2013

                According to Malaysian Ambassador Eldeen Husaini Mohd Hashim, those reluctant to be rescued or flown back to Malaysia are usually either runaways or victims hiding from loan sharks

                Eldeen said the Malaysian government has been working hard with the Cambodian authorities to crack down on these syndicates

                And at Liverpool, the conditions are far better than either Juventus or Barcelona at the moment for things to finally work out for Arthur, who retains big hopes of heading to the World Cup as a starter for his country

                It would take a lot to convince Liverpool to sign Arthur permanently for £32m next summer, but it certainly isn't out of the question.

            <p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 — Barisan Nasional was not seeking an early general election to protect its leaders but to “save” Malaysians from being manipulated by the coalition’s rivals, Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said

            <p>
                While he did not name these rivals, his reference to the 2018 general election indicated that he meant Pakatan Harapan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid said the country has faced failure after failure since the May 9, 2018 general election and that this must be prevented from happening again for the country’s sake

            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid’s Umno has repeatedly urged Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to call for an early general election, but amplified this when Datuk Seri Najib Razak was sent to prison last month after losing his final appeal against his SRC International conviction

                The juxtaposition has allowed critics to suggest that Umno’s growing desire for a general election now, before one is due next September, was to prevent more of its so-called “court cluster” from being convicted.

                Isham also said that this was unlike Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who won the Umno president's post after being elected by a majority of the 191 party delegates, He added that this meant that the Bagan Datuk MP had obtained a mandate to speak and decides for Umno

                Isham added that Umno would never accept Abdul Hadi's proposal of cooperating with "traitors"

            <p>
                Isham was responding to Abdul Hadi, who said on Friday (Sept 3) afternoon at the PAS muktamar (annual general assembly) that Umno was not just about Ahmad Zahid

                You could see he tried but you could see he couldn’t run properly, we just waited for half time to make the change.” While not a serious issue, it is another knock that Liverpool could do without with their options already limited and placing extra strain on those who are currently fit

            <p>
                But what is effectively a stop-gap deal is unlikely to define Ward’s first transfer window in sole charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is nothing especially wrong with the fees Liverpool received for those players who have departed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Between the pair of them, Ward could have hoped to raise somewhere in the region of £25m
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even so, Ward has to be given credit for a very reasonable first transfer window at the helm for Liverpool

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Sept 3 — The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said yesterday that it has ordered the recall of a type of Malaysian-made soy sauce after it detected a type of additive that exceeded the regulatory limit for sauces here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The additive — which it identified as benzoic acid — was not declared on the food packaging of the Hand Flower Brand soy sauce
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only permitted food additives that are within the imposed maximum levels are allowed for use in food under the Singapore Food Regulations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is especially because soy sauce is “not a staple food consumed at high levels”, it added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, consumers should not take food containing high levels of benzoic acid over a long period of time

                “This is because even though benzoic acid is a common additive, which is safe when used in small quantities, studies in animals fed with high doses of benzoic acid have shown disorder of the central nervous system as well as changes in their brains,” SFA said
