            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rejecting the defence’s request for a postponement, Tengku Maimun said all parties in the case – including Najib, the accused person – were well aware since April that the appeals had been fixed for hearing from Aug 15 to 26, and that the request for an adjournment on the same ground had been refused by the court registrar during the pre-trial case management

                PSB president Wong Soon Koh had said on Sunday the party would avail itself of all available remedies against See, whom he claimed had made an oral and written undertaking before being chosen as PSB’s candidate in the last state election
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to Wong, See had to compensate the party if he chose to resign after winning the seat on a PSB ticket
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                See had said his decision to leave PSB was to free himself from party politics to spend more time on his work as an assemblyman and to work with others, including NGOs, who shared his mission for a better Sarawak
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said his decision had nothing to do with the anti-hopping law to be enforced soon, or to form a new party and that he was not interested in contesting in the upcoming general election

                See first won the Batu Lintang state seat in the 10th Sarawak election in 2011 as a PKR candidate and successfully defended the seat in the following election in 2016, before switching to PSB to win for the third time in the state election last year

                I know that the gorilla in the room is launching missiles over Taiwan,” Seventh Fleet commander vice-admiral Karl Thomas told reporters in Singapore
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Thomas compared the threats against Taiwan to the South China Sea where Beijing spent years constructing military bases and facilities on a series of contested atolls, while denying it was doing just that
            </p>

                “If you don’t challenge it… all of a sudden it can become just like the islands in the South China Sea (that) have now become military outposts,” he said

                Arul Kanda filed his application to strike out the suit last June and the application by Irwan was filed on Feb 18 this year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his application, Irwan alleged, among others, that the suit against him was premature as the investment of Brazen Sky Ltd and the payment of Aabar Investments PJS Ltd were not clearly unsustainable because the court had yet to determine 1MDB suffered losses of US$1.83 billion (RM8.17 billion) and US$3.5 billion (RM15.6 billion)

                1MDB filed the suit against Arul Kanda and Irwan in May last year, alleging that they had committed breach of trust and conspiracy causing 1MDB to suffer losses amounting to US$1.83 billion in relation to its investment in 1MDB-Petrosaudi Ltd, which was converted into the alleged Brazen Sky investment said to be found in the Bridge Global Fund

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                1MDB also alleged that the two defendants committed breach of trust and conspiracy by misappropriating 1MDB money amounting to US$3.5 billion paid to Aabar Investments and US$1.265 billion paid to International Petroleum Investment Company (Ipic) on May 9, 2017
            </p>

                “The question is, how do I ensure that the upgrade or construction work is completed properly and according to the set standards if I am not even allowed to enter the school,” she said in a statement

                In a statement, the party's committee member Lim Wei Jiet said that none of the companies to which Ahmad Ramli was charged with channelling payments without the company's approval, was explicitly mentioned in the PAC report

                The second charge was for approving a payment of RM1,360,716 payment to JSD Corporation Pte Ltd at the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited in Singapore also without approval of the BNS board

                Ahmad Ramli, who was also chairman of the LCS Steering Committee, also allegedly appointed committee members without the approval of the BNS board

                In its report released on August 8, Parliament's bipartisan watchdog Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said BNS was awarded a RM9.128 billion 10-year contract from 2013 to 2023 for the supply of the six LCS

                The PAC report also said the Malaysian government had to date already paid RM6.083 billion to the contractor, but none of the six LCS vessels has been completed

                At a meeting with the staff of the Prime Minister’s Department (JPM) here, Ismail said civil servants should defend the government by looking at him as the head of the government and not as a political party leader

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 16 — Two videos have emerged over the weekend showing shoppers rushing to leave a shopping mall and an Ikea store in Shanghai after the locations were alerted of possible positive Covid-19 cases

                The first incident occurred in Ikea, located in Shanghai's Xuhui district on August 13 where local media reported that a six-year-old boy who returned from Lhasa in Tibet had been diagnosed with Covid-19

                In a second video said to take place in a shopping mall in the Yangpu district of Shanghai, patrons of the Oriental Fisherman's Wharf mall were notified of a positive Covid case inside the mall, requiring them to be taken to a quarantine hospital for 48 hours

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Reuters reported yesterday that a court in military-ruled Myanmar handed down the sentence after finding Suu Kyi guilty in four corruption cases, after she had already been sentenced to 11 years in prison in other cases
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Suu Kyi has denied all the charges against her
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The additional sentencing of Suu Kyi and the recent execution of four democracy activists prove that the junta repeatedly disregards calls by Asean leaders for concrete and inclusive dialogue for national reconciliation in Myanmar,” said Saifuddin in a tweet
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Suu Kyi, a 77-year-old Nobel laureate and the figurehead of Myanmar’s opposition to military rule, has been charged with at least 18 offences ranging from corruption to election violations, carrying combined maximum jail terms of nearly 190 years

                Saifuddin said Malaysia stands with the people of Myanmar and supports calls for Suu Kyi’s immediate release

                The bench only ordered the two to pay Hadi RM10,000 in costs for the proceedings in the High Court and Court of Appeal

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On May 11 last year, High Court judge Akhtar Tahir allowed Hadi’s application to strike out the suit, holding that the two plaintiffs lacked locus standi to bring the action

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said their complaint was that the attorney-general (AG), who is also the public prosecutor, had not charged Hadi

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                “We agree with the High Court’s observation that there is no conceivable reason to ask for the declarations and the suit was an exercise in futility,” he said

                He said Mara Digital centres had been established in Shah Alam, Kuantan and Ipoh, while other places that had been identified were Larkin in Johor, Kuala Terengganu, Kota Bharu, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu

                Mizan Mohammad Aslam of Universiti Malaysia Perlis said doing so would prevent leakages in the procurement of military assets from recurring

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mizan also said the time had come for the country to rope in experts from the 21 public universities to develop it’s own military technology
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was commenting on the controversy surrounding the littoral combat ship (LCS) project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The project has come under much scrutiny after Parliament’s PAC chairman Wong Kah Woh revealed that not a single ship had been completed although Putrajaya had spent RM6 billion on the project, which was given to Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd through direct negotiations
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mizan also called for the government to set up a committee to look into whether the debate over the LCS project had compromised the nation’s security
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the government should show that it was not compromising on any alleged weaknesses in its procurement processes by taking “stern action” on those involved in any wrongdoing in the LCS project

                Lee, who previously predicted that Warisan would struggle in Peninsular Malaysia, said the party should not stretch itself after losing its chance to prove that it could run the state government

                Khaled praised Ismail, a fellow Umno vice-president, for being brave in abolishing import permits (APs) for food “especially since the AP is perceived to be a curse that people avoid”
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Ismail had implemented many radical changes since taking office, including seeing through the anti-hopping bill
            </p>
            <p> </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The anti-hopping bill was one of the reforms demanded by Pakatan Harapan in return for keeping Ismail’s government in office

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khaled said the public should also recognise Ismail’s commitment to declassifying a government investigation report on the troubled littoral combat ship programme to build six frigates for the navy

                Its Building Control Department director Norizan Sulaiman said beginning early this year, all house renovation plans approved by the council would be valid for a year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the past, those affected by their neighbour’s renovation that became a safety issue could take action under the Local Government Act

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Those affected could lodge a complaint with DBKL and the local authority could compel the house owner to fix the repairs caused by his or her construction

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In an interview on Monday with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, Wong said the relationship between the world’s biggest economies was on a “very worrying” trajectory in the wake of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and China’s subsequent military drills around the island
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As they say, no one deliberately wants to go into battle, but we sleep walk into conflict,” he added
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “And that’s the biggest problem and danger.” Wong expressed concern about a potential accident in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea, citing a 2001 incident when an American spy plane made an emergency landing on China’s southern Hainan Island after colliding with a Chinese jet
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A city-state dependent on trade, Singapore supports a strong American presence in Asia by allowing the US to access military facilities while also counting China as its top trading partner
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong said the international community is entering a “new world order” in which trade, economics and finance are used as “instruments of geopolitical contests.” “The old logic used to be that with more trade we can tamp down geopolitical rivalries,” he said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Now there is another logic at play, which is geopolitics can undermine trade

                This followed an incident on Friday (Aug 13) where a small quantity of silver-type round herring fries was also found stranded on the beach

                She said many residents and visitors took the opportunity to collect the anchovies between 11am and 1pm yesterday, adding that investigations found that the rare incident only happened at Pasir Bogak beach

                "Fishermen in the area said large fish, especially the alu-alu fish (yellowtail barracuda) could be hunting the anchovies forcing them to jump onto the beach,” she said, adding that the bright lights in the area might also lure the anchovies to the beach

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Putin used a speech at an arms show near Moscow to boast of Russia's advanced weapons capabilities and declare its willingness to share technology with like-minded countries

                "(We) are ready to offer our allies the most modern types of weapons, from small arms to armored vehicles and artillery to combat aviation and unmanned aerial vehicles," Putin said at the opening ceremony of the "Army-2022" forum near Moscow

                Western military analysts say the poor performance of Russian troops and weaponry could make its arms exports less attractive to potential buyers, such as India, which have heavily relied on its technology in the past

                Moreover, Sithambaram further argued that it was irrational for Najib to allege that Mohd Nazlan’s past employment with Maybank Group was a fact recently discovered or deliberately suppressed from him since they were known in the public domain
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said information of Mohd Nazlan’s previous appointment with Maybank Group became the centre of attention in August 2018, before the commencement of the trial, when the news that Mohd Nazlan was to preside over the trial was being widely reported in the media
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “My Lady, before the commencement of the trial, everyone knew Justice Nazlan was from Maybank
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                They knew that,” he said, adding that even Najib’s own affidavit in support had disclosed Mohd Nazlan’s role in the financial institution

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib’s first counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah previously claimed on June 7 that Mohd Nazlan had failed to disclose his position in Maybank Group, which was responsible for proposing the establishment of SRC International
            </p>

                In his supporting affidavit, Najib said the evidence he sought to adduce was not made available to him at trial, adding that the evidence was relevant to the issues before the High Court and Court of Appeal and thus would be relevant to his appeals that would be adjudicated in the Federal Court

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Party president Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal said Beaufort division has yet to hold its division meeting, while Lahad Datu and Kota Marudu divisions had some irregularities during their meetings
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The party leadership has decided to take these actions against these three divisions, so they cannot send delegates to vote during party elections
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “We have asked the Beaufort division to do their divisional level meeting after the AGM, since the AGM dates are already near

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Both Lahad Datu and Kota Marudu divisions will also be manned from the party headquarters, and their divisional meetings will also be based on the situation after the AGM,” he told reporters after chairing the party supreme council meeting in conjunction with the party AGM and elections this Aug 26 and 27
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Mohd Shafie is confident that support remains strong for the party in these three divisions

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The project value is (circa) RM9 billion for six ships (LCS), so the cost for one ship is about RM1.5 billion, so with RM6 billion being spent, you would expect at least four to be built … but no, not even one
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                From the PAC report, it is understood that BNS had made additional claims which would have driven up the price of the six vessels to an astronomical RM11.14 billion, or RM1.86 billion per LCS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Until 2014, the government had forked out RM5 billion to BNS, out of which RM1.02 billion was deemed a “mobilisation payment”, which many say is huge for a project of this size
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This bit of history is relevant to what is going on now with the LCS because of the RM6.08 billion paid by the government for the RM9.13 billion contract, RM1.4 billion was not utilised for the project at all, RM1 billion was termed a cost overrun, and RM400 million was used to settle PSCI’s debts
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Strangely, BNS had total assets of RM1.51 billion, with total liabilities also pegged at RM1.51 billion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                BNS is also said to have been actively acquiring equipment and had amassed RM1.7 billion worth in its stores

                The exercises were "a stern deterrent to the United States and Taiwan continuing to play political tricks and undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait", it added

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail Sabri, Malaysia’s ninth prime minister, also has suggested that Bahasa Melayu be made Asan's second official language
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Universiti Teknologi Malaysia geostrategist Prof Dr Azmi Hassan and international affairs analyst Associate Prof Dr Roy Anthony Rogers Peter Rogers told Bernama that Ismail Sabri’s effort to use the national language at international events should be appreciated
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "It is difficult for Malaysia as a small country to present this concept, but our foreign policy is in line with the concept of the Malaysian Family and 'World Family'," said Prof Azmi
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The World Family concept is the larger extension of Ismail Sabri’s Malaysian Family ideal that he introduced in his inaugural speech when he took over the country’s leadership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail Sabri has highlighted the concept at international conferences including during the 76th UNGA in September 2021
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At the regional level, particularly at the Asean level, Ismail Sabri has voiced Malaysia's steadfast position on the crisis in Myanmar since the Feb 1 (2021) coup, and the Rohingya refugee issue where Malaysia is hosting up to 200,000 of the refugees

                “This was a centralisation of power by the former Prime Minister,” Albanese, who has sought advice from the solicitor-general, Australia’s second law officer, told reporters today

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This is a government of Australia, where the people of Australia were kept in the dark as to what the ministerial arrangements were.” Morrison, who was prime minister from 2018 to 2022, did not respond to a request for comment
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Australian newspaper said Morrison was appointed health minister in 2020, alongside Health Minister Greg Hunt, to avoid concentrating power in one person when biosecurity emergency powers were adopted to tackle the coronavirus pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was later also appointed finance minister and resources minister

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Former resources minister Keith Pitt told broadcaster ABC the situation was “unusual” and he was “concerned” when he was told Morrison shared his responsibilities in 2021

                Love you mum and dad, now and forever." Aloysius Fong repeated these sentiments in Newcastle Crown Court on Friday (Aug 12) before his father was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder

                Najib’s lead defence counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah has requested from High Court judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah an adjournment of at least two weeks because the final appeal in the SRC trial in the Federal Court is scheduled to take place until Aug 26

                Rahman indicated that the price hike for spare parts could be as much as 60 per cent, depending on what needed replacements

                “The price of lubricant usually goes up only 2 per cent to 3 per cent every two to three years, but this year the price has gone up twice,” he was quoted as saying

                They have until August 31 to complete and agree to the terms, or risk losing out on access to Malaysia's 5G single wholesale network being rolled out rapidly now by the Ministry of Finance owned DNB
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The other four companies — Celcom, DiGi, YTL and Telekom Malaysia — agreed earlier to take up shares in DNB that were offered to them by the government
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also pointed out that while the six Malaysian telcos have agreed to take up shares in DNB, a full completion of the deal can only happen once they agree to the access terms by August 31
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But the stakes are contingent on the former companies agreeing access terms with DNB

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It was clear from the testimony by Abdul Aziz, 66, that he made the decision because many of the actions by Boustead Naval Shipyard (BNS), a unit of BHIC, was allegedly against the interest of the navy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was the BNS’ LCS programme director

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Abdul Aziz’s main grievance was RMN’s objection to the design of the ships as he felt the navy, as the end user, should have a say but his views were ignored by the contractor, BHIC, which was supposed to build the six LCS
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The testimony by Abdul Aziz is serious as he has a shiny 41-year journey as a naval officer, including seven-and-a-half years as RMN chief

                Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz is confident that Malaysia will have positive economic growth at least until the third quarter of this year and emphasised that the country must be prepared for a slowdown in the global economy

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier this month, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said that Malaysia will find it a challenge to avoid an economic recession next year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nevertheless, Tengku Zafrul is confident that Malaysia will have positive economic growth at least until the third quarter of this year and emphasised that the country must be prepared for a slowdown in the global economy

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Malaysia blindly followed the anti-scientific world trend and now finds itself sharing that same fate.” Ferlito said Malaysia’s economic recovery so far has been driven by private consumption and government spending
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “For the future, I expect Malaysia’s economic growth to be even more fragile, as government spending will have to slow down if we want to seriously tackle inflation.” Ferlito said inflation may slow down private consumption and that external trade may suffer due to the global uncertainties

                Malaysia’s economy grew 8.9% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2022, driven mainly by the continued pick-up in domestic economic activities following further reopening of the economy, as well as international borders

                “Mara Digital Mall’s management and vendors should emulate this.” Mara Digital Mall was launched in 2015 and had branches in Kuala Lumpur, Shah Alam, Johor Bahru and Kuantan

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Halim said another factor in Mara Digital Mall’s poor fortunes was the lack of variety in the items and services when compared to Low Yat Plaza
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Halim added that Mara Digital Mall could not simply rely on its low rental and strategic location to succeed, but needed to take a proactive approach to promote its stores and services widely

                A health worker inoculates a woman with a dose of the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine during a mass vaccination at a zoo in Surabaya on September 13, 2021

                He explained that in December of last year, roughly 30% of Indonesia's targeted 208 million population had not received Covid-19 vaccines, while last month only some 18% had not been inoculated

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As of Friday, more than 202 million Indonesians had received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines, some 170.4 million had been jabbed with a second dose and around 58.2 million had received a third shot

                Pandu said the highest increase in antibody titer was observed among respondents who had received a booster dose, with an average of 4,496 units per millilitre

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Indonesia’s monthly vaccine rollout has been decreasing significantly since March of this year, with the government attributing the slowdown to increasing vaccine hesitancy among the public due to the improving Covid-19 situation

                The government managed to increase its vaccine rollout to around 7.7 million doses after the mandatory booster regulation was in place, however, average daily vaccinations still hover at around 250,000 per day, much lower than the around one million shots administered per day achieved earlier this year
