                Masidi reportedly said there was no problem with the other oil and gas companies operating in Sabah as they had been paying the SST on time
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Sabah would be able to rake in RM1.2 billion annually if all of the firms had paid the SST on time
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Masidi who is also state local government and housing minister reportedly said the issue was “being dealt with” by Sabah and Petronas, while the state government would pursue the matter within its legal power
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In July, Masidi told the state assembly that Sabah would cancel the work permits of the two firms if they failed to settle the RM97 million in SST owed to the state
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the two companies were issued notices on the overdue SST on June 21, with the amount set to be settled within 30 days
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Masidi had also said Sabah collected RM808 million in SST on petroleum products in the first six months of the year

                In calling for the charges to be dropped, the youth wing leaders of PH component parties said the charges were a waste of court resources and that such charges were meant to “intimidate the youth”

                Earlier today, Hasbie, Batu PKR youth chief Sabda Suluh Lestari Yahya and student activist Aliff Naif Mohd Fizam, were charged with failing to notify the police five days before staging their gatherings
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hasbie’s charge was related to an event he had allegedly organised at Masjid Jamek, Kampung Baru on July 1, while Sabda’s charge concerned a protest in front of the Sogo shopping complex on July 9

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ahmad Maslan noted the Federal Court’s unanimous decision to reject Najib’s bid to add in purported new evidence regarding Mohd Nazlan’s purported conflict of interest, and the MACC investigation paper on the judge having been sent to the Attorney General’s Chambers since May 18 or three months ago
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the months leading up to Najib’s final SRC appeal hearing at the Federal Court, wild allegations have been made online against Mohd Nazlan in what appears to be mudslinging attempts against him
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Tuesday, the Federal Court’s five-judge panel unanimously rejected Najib’s bid to ultimately seek for a retrial, pointing out that the purported “new” evidence was actually evidence already available before the SRC trial began in 2019 and Mohd Nazlan’s previous Maybank role was already known to Najib’s lawyers back then
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Federal Court had also said the purported new oral and documentary evidence which Najib wanted to add to the SRC case were “irrelevant” to the criminal charges against him and failed to show conflict of interest by Mohd Nazlan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Federal Court said the rejection of the application to add evidence to the SRC case would not result in miscarriage of justice, as such evidence was already available at the SRC trial or could have been discovered then through reasonable diligence and were also totally irrelevant to the charges, and as Najib could still challenge the High Court and Court of Appeal judgments in the SRC appeal at the Federal Court

                That is my position," he told the Federal Court

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court will not repeat itself.” Hisyam clarified that his position is that he would only file fresh submissions if the defence is provided with an adjournment

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But when the court reconvened after lunch, Hisyam informed the Federal Court that the defence would be filing fresh submissions to defend Najib — before eventually walking back on this notice to the court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib’s defence had come to the appeal hearing unaccompanied by written submissions to the Federal Court

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The conviction and sentence were upheld by the Court of Appeal on Dec 8 last year, which resulted in this final appeal at the Federal Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                RECENTLY, it has been said that a lawyer climbed across balconies into an adjacent unit to record a video of a neighbour bathing
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As their toilets were next to each other, Yeo could tell when the victim was in the shower by listening for her voice or the sound of videos playing
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the evening of Nov 23, 2020, he deduced that she was bathing and climbed over the parapet and into her balcony to film her
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He held his phone outside the shower window but the victim caught a glimpse of the phone before he could start recording
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He later deleted the video

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 18 — Lawyers representing the co-owners of the Crackhouse Comedy Club have demanded that the Kuala Lumpur mayor reverse the ban on the premises and its owners’ freedom to open businesses in Kuala Lumpur, within two days
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The letter reportedly said that Crackhouse Comedy Club owners were not officially notified about the revocation of the club’s licence and the blacklisting, adding that they had never been found guilty of any offence that justified the Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s (DBKL) decision
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                National news agency Bernama yesterday reported Deputy Federal Territories Minister Datuk Seri Jalaluddin Alias as saying that DBKL had blacklisted the owners of the Crackhouse Comedy Club for life, for violating the terms of its licence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Jalaluddin said the club’s business was revoked effective July 30 and the names of the club’s owners were blacklisted for life
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the individuals concerned can also no longer obtain a business licence in Kuala Lumpur, even if they were to use a different company name or attempt to run a different business
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On July 10, Jalaluddin was reported to have said that the premises was operating without the correct licence because it only had a restaurant licence and not an entertainment one

                N Sundra Rajoo said the Federal Court last year had concluded that Thomas had acted in excess of authority in failing to give due regard to his (Sundra’s) immunity
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The plaintiff (Sundra) denies that Thomas had properly exercised his discretion under Article 145(3) of the Federal Constitution,” he said in reply to Thomas’ defence filed early this month
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sundra, in his statement in reply, said Thomas also did not act honestly as he was aware that Sundra enjoyed immunity from prosecution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sundra said by Thomas’s own conduct, he recognised that a waiver had to be given by the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organisation (AALCO) and not Sundra’s successor, the late Vinayak Pradhan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said it was similarly not open to Thomas to contend that Sundra’s immunity violated the equality clause under Article 8 of the constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The apex court said Sundra’s functional immunity included immunity from criminal proceedings and that he had acted to safeguard the interests of AIAC and AALCO

                Acting Perak police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Azizi Mat Aris said the incident was believed to have been triggered by a heated argument between the 69-year-old taxi driver and his 67-year-old brother

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "The deceased, a former trader, was found covered in blood in the kitchen while the taxi driver's body was found outside the house," he told a press conference near the house on Thursday (Aug 18)
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "We also found a knife, believed to be the murder weapon, next to the taxi driver," he said, adding that the police were informed of the incident at about 10am Thursday

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The PN representatives previously identified to meet officially with the prime minister were Hamzah, Ahmad, Supreme Council member Takiyuddin Hassan and information chief Azmin Ali

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked if the PN representatives had also brought up the issue of the deputy prime minister’s post in their unofficial meeting with Ismail, Hamzah said “no” and that their discussions were focused on current political issues
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “There was no discussion on the position

                However, he did not reject the possibility that the issue of the deputy prime minister’s post would be discussed in the official meeting with Ismail later

                Thursday, 18 Aug 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A Federal Court panel comprising Tan Sri Azahar Mohamed, Datuk Seri Hasnah Mohammed Hashim and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais delivered the decision on Aug 17, 2022
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Federal Court decision reflects the seriousness of the breaches and reinforces the robustness of the SC’s Audit Oversight Board’s (AOB) enforcement framework, the SC said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In addition, the AOB also imposed fines of RM455,000 on AFTAAS, and RM88,000 each on Mohd Afrizan and Khairul, respectively
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                With the Federal Court decision, the stay on the AOB’s enforcement decisions until the disposal of the leave application to the Federal Court obtained by AFTAAS and its partners at the Court of Appeal on Feb 11, 2022, has lapsed
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As such, the sanctions imposed by the AOB in its enforcement decision including the prohibitions shall take effect from Aug 17, 2022

                In a joint statement, the duo also lambasted the delay in declassifying the PH ordered forensic audit, and shared several excerpts from the Proceeding Report (Hansard) of the Public Account Committee (PAC) dated March 8, which they claim provides details of the audit results

                “The Government Governance, Procurement and Finance Investigation Committee (JKSTUPKK) report was declassified yesterday but the forensic audit report and the former admiral of the Navy Tan Sri Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor's letter of reprimand have not yet been declassified

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “However, the findings of this forensic audit are also shocking,” they said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former ministers said that on Page 27 of the PAC proceedings report, Prabhat Kumar, the executive director of Alliance Investigative and Forensic Accounting, testified to the PAC that those involved had no intention to deliver the LCS project, but only had intentions to maximise their own gains
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On page 22, En Prabhat Kumar says that ‘It is clear that in the case of the LCS programme, Anuar bin Murad sidestepped the authority of all of his subordinates, and acted in a manner as if they were only two persons in the whole organisation’.” “It is an outright conflict of interest whereby Tan Sri Ramli is the chairman of the LCS Steering Committee and CAD, and at the same time also the Managing Director of BHIC,” they said.

                Political appointments to GLCs has become a common practice in Malaysia

                For the record, some GLCs have been set up to meet public needs, and politicians, being representatives of the people, would be in a better position to ensure that those objectives are met

                Hishammuddin said yesterday the ongoing construction of the first LCS (LCS 1), which was to have been delivered to the navy in 2019, will not involve new allocations from the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Lim noted that when Hishammuddin appeared before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Jan 25, he said Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) would have to deliver two LCS without any additional cost to the government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Hishammuddin should explain why the defence ministry has reduced from two LCS to one LCS which must be completed and delivered by the contractor with no additional government funds,” he said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his testimony before the PAC, Hishammuddin had said that if the government wanted to proceed with the project, “we cannot put all the money upfront if Boustead doesn’t commit to being able to deliver at least two ships”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the Hansard sighted by FMT, he said that completing the first two LCS “will not affect upfront payment” as they are “still under the contractual amount”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At a defence ministry event, Hishammuddin told reporters that additional allocations for BNS to complete the remaining five LCS would only be considered after completion of LCS 1 in reportedly another two years

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Human Resources Minister said the scheme to cover homemakers against injuries suffered while tending to their chores would be managed by the Social Security Organisation (Socso)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On July 26, the Dewan Rakyat passed the Housewives Social Security Bill (HSS), which allows husbands to voluntarily contribute to the scheme for their wives below the age of 55
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked if the definition of housewife would be widened to cover husbands who assume the role of homemakers as well, Saravanan said the ministry would need an in-depth study to see the number of house husbands involved
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “No action would be taken against any husband who did not contribute.” However, he noted that husbands who have signed up to contribute and failed to maintain it monthly would be fined RM10,000
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saravanan also said the amendments passed in the Employment Insurance System Act 2017 (Act 800) and Employees’ Social Security Act 1969 (Act 4) to increase the maximum monthly salary ceiling limit from RM4,000 to RM5,000 would come into effect next month

                In a statement, the federation’s president Datuk Dr Syed Hussain Syed Husman said economic growth in the second half of this year is expected to slow to between 5% and 6%, compared with 8.9% reported in the second quarter

                “I know he is an honest lawyer, and we can tell an honest lawyer from a dishonest one.”  The former law minister was speaking to the press after the apex court dismissed Najib’s application to adduce fresh evidence to prove that trial judge Nazlan Ghazali was under a serious conflict of interest when presiding over the SRC trial two years ago

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Zaid also commiserated with the former prime minister on the setback he suffered but vowed to stay the course

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Earlier, Hisyam told the press of his own dissatisfaction with the apex court’s decision to reject Najib’s motion to adduce further evidence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Unfortunately, the court did not appreciate our arguments.” He also said he was “terribly disappointed and saddened by the stance taken by the Federal Court” in rejecting his legal team’s request to postpone the appeal proper
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                The statement by the police this evening follows the revelation by the victim, a student at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM), that it had been more than a year since she filed a report about it with the police and the university administration
