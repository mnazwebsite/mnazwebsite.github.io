                “That’s hilarious!” Najib responded in a Facebook post

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Najib did not respond to a threat by Rafizi that he would divulge details of shell companies used to launder money from the RM9 billion littoral combat ship project, which entails the construction of six corvette-class ships for the navy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rafizi said that his upcoming expose on the LCS project would put the former prime minister in a spot
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the finance ministry under PH had wanted to sell a 28-storey office tower in Hong Kong belonging to China Evergrande Group for RM1.6 billion, and had held talks to sell a 60% stake in the Bandar Malaysia mixed commercial project for RM7.41 billion to property developer Iskandar Waterfront Holdings and China Railway Engineering Corp

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The LCS project was the subject of a report by Parliament’s watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee, which said that not a single ship had been completed despite RM6 billion being spent since 2011

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Over the past month, some Bersatu leaders had been pressing Ismail to honour his promise to elect a deputy prime minister from the party, as was previously agreed when Bersatu decided to support Ismail’s appointment as prime minister
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Wasn’t there a promise with PH, in which Bersatu was a component, for Dr Mahathir Mohamad to be prime minister for two years, after which the position would be handed over to Anwar Ibrahim?” he said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “That was a clear breach of promise too.” Similarly, Hassan pointed to Hamzah’s collusion with Mahathir to organise the Malay Dignity Congress in 2019, calling it part of the efforts to derail Anwar’s promised premiership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the end, he said, it was Muhyiddin who became prime minister instead of Anwar
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “For them to now accuse Ismail of forgetting his promise, well it’s clearly a case of the pot calling the kettle black,” Hassan said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Ismail had cleverly countered Bersatu’s threats not to support his administration by stating that a general election (GE15) must be held if that happens
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hassan said such a move would also see Bersatu receive a lot of flak from the public, and be seen as defiant to the King’s mandate, calling for political stability

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rafizi was responding to a post by former prime minister Najib Razak, who claimed that Pakatan Harapan had halted the project after coming to power in 2018, effectively delaying the construction of the ships
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The project has come under much scrutiny after the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Parliament’s watchdog, recently said not a single ship had been completed despite the government spending RM6 billion since 2011
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A PAC report said the defence ministry and contractor Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS) had also ignored the navy’s views on the project

                About Us Advertise KUCHING, Aug 7 — Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg today stressed that the state government will protect non-Muslims and care for them to achieve togetherness and inclusion
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said as an example the Sarawak government has channeled aid to non-Muslims through the Unit for Other Religions (UNIFOR) on the basis that non-Muslims also need the protection and care of the state government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the state government has also provided an allocation of RM70 million to build UNIFOR Building in Jalan Ong Tiang Swee, Kuching, so that its administration is more organised and the implementation of religious activities under UNIFOR is more orderly
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I am confident and believe that togetherness in terms of religious development between the Muslim and non-Muslim communities in Sarawak will give birth to a society that is friendly to each other and avoids prejudices that can cause division,” the premier said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said as the head of the state government who is a Muslim, he has always insisted that the “Charter of Medina” is a very suitable guide to guarantee fair administration for the multi-ethnic and multi-religious communities in Sarawak
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Abang Johari said in Sarawak, with the high spirit of understanding and unity that has been built over the years a multi-ethnic and religious community of small Keluarga Sarawak under the auspices of a large Keluarga Malaysia has been established

                He, however, said if there is any collaboration, that would only happen after the next general election

                Loke said collaboration between parties from different divides is more likely to happen since the 2018 general election when the country’s political landscape faced drastic changes, particularly the absence of a single dominant party

                On DAP’s stand regarding the prime minister candidate, Loke said the party was firmly behind Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, though the Seremban MP did not rule out the need for compromise if no party had a clear majority after the 15th general election

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “We do not think that that particular case will damage the party’s image,” he said indicating that the party trusts Lim and is confident of Lim’s integrity

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Tension between the prime minister and PN has reportedly increased with the Bersatu-led coalition accusing Ismail of failing to fulfil several promises including the appointment of a deputy prime minister
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                PN reportedly wanted to withdraw support for the government as a result, but Universiti Malaya (UM) sociopolitical analyst Awang Azman Pawi said Ismail’s insistence yesterday that he would not hesitate to call for the next general election (GE15) if PN pulled the plug means the prime minister has effectively called Bersatu’s bluff
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If they have the deputy prime minister’s post, they can be seen as having strengthened their position in the government,” Awang Azman said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “They need the deputy prime minister’s post to prove that they are still relevant and to boost their image and influence
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He has the upper hand.” He stressed that Ismail’s announcement yesterday was also important as he would not want to be “blamed by Umno” for giving Bersatu – an Umno splinter party – such a key role in the government, especially as most Umno leaders were not informed about Ismail’s agreement with PN
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Meanwhile, another analyst, Sivamurugan Pandian of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), noted that Bersatu’s persistence for the deputy prime minister’s post did not seem to have gone as planned

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a statement today, Shahrizat said that the Court of Appeal's decision reinforcing that Malaysian women cannot confer citizenship is devastating for Malaysian women
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In this case, the Malaysian government had appealed against the High Court's September 9, 2021 decision, which recognised that Malaysia’s citizenship laws discriminated against women and which had ruled that Malaysian mothers whose children are born overseas should also be entitled to Malaysian citizenship
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                While waiting for the Court of Appeal to decide on the appeal, the six Malaysian mothers who filed the suit managed to obtain citizenship documents from the National Registration Department (NRD) for their overseas-born children
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This was because the High Court and Court of Appeal refused to allow the government to defer issuing the citizenship papers while waiting for the appeal to be decided
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                After the decision on Friday, lawyer for the six Malaysian mothers, Datuk Gurdial Singh Nijar informed the Court of Appeal that his clients would be appealing to the Federal Court
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Court of Appeal however, ruled that status quo should be maintained for the overseas-born children of the six Malaysian mothers who had obtained the Malaysian citizenship papers, until the Federal Court decides on their appeal

                “They are the group we hope to target, and we will also carry out other efforts to attract non-Malay support for Bersatu and Perikatan Nasional (PN).” The former Pemanis assemblyman was asked about the wing’s efforts to attract non-Malay support for Bersatu after the resignation of Segamat MP Edmund Santhara Kumar as the head of the party’s associate wing

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Asked why non-Malays should join Bersatu when the party is spearheaded by one race only, Chong said that the wing he leads does not fight for race-based issues alone

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Bersatu’s associate wing is more about diversity of issues as opposed to becoming a ‘champion’ fighting for race and racial issues,” said Chong

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Bersatu president Muhyiddin Yassin accepted Santhara’s resignation as the party’s associate wing chairman on July 28

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Santhara will, however, remain a Bersatu member and continue to back Muhyiddin’s leadership, a source told FMT

                DAP secretary-general Loke Siew Fook has said it was to safeguard the party from a “loophole” in the new anti-hopping law, but a party insider said the amendment might not be necessary

                Many of these highly regarded convent schools were built over 100 years ago, with the first IJS school as well as orphanage set up in Light Street, George Town, in 1852
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a rare interview, Sister Mary Theresa Chua, the Provincial of the IJS – which is legally known as the Lady Superior of the Society of Saint Maur – says the estimated RM3mil annual grants from the Education Ministry (MOE) for all 56 schools would only be enough for basic maintenance, working out to around “RM50,000 to RM70,000 for each school’’
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The site borders the Kuala Lumpur Forest Eco Park, and Sister Theresa fears that the ongoing wet spell and the year-end rainy season would be a problem

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In 2020, a landslip also hit the school, which was established in 1899, after heavy rain caused a near collapse of a retaining wall
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sister Theresa describes the plight of convent schools in Malaysia, which have produced hundreds of thousands of students including prominent figures, as desperate

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sister Theresa says there is an urgent need for the MOE to meet Mission school authorities to talk about critical building issues, such as, for example, electrical appliances like airconditioners, computers and projectors that have led to capacity overload

                PKR information chief Fahmi Fadzil asked why Najib did not take up the concerns expressed by then navy chief Abdul Aziz Jaafar about the littoral combat ship project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The project entails the construction of six corvette-class ships for the Royal Malaysian Navy, with the first ship due for delivery this month
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib said the project was only resumed by the current government in April
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Maybe the navy would have already got the much-needed littoral combat ships.” A report by the PAC on Thursday said the defence ministry and contractor Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd had ignored the navy’s views on the project
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The PAC report said Aziz had testified that he wrote two letters to Najib, five letters to the defence minister, 10 to the ministry’s secretary-general, and one each to the secretary-general of the Treasury, and chief secretary to the government
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib said earlier the project had been investigated by a government committee in 2018, when PH was in power, and by the police after BNS lodged a police report in December 2020

                The assembly members had filed a suit against the state legislative assembly and state assembly speaker to prevent their seats from being vacated under a state constitutional provision against party-hopping

                Chow said the state government would decide on the matter after the High Court’s decision

                “We will follow whatever is applicable based on the unanimous decision of the Federal Court that Article 14A of the Penang state constitution is valid, constitutional and should remain as it is,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The article provides that an assembly member must vacate the seat if he ceases to be a member of the party on whose ticket he was elected

                Separately, the Penang state assembly and the speaker then posed a legal question to the Federal Court on whether Article 14A was void for being inconsistent with the Federal Constitution

                Wang dismissed Washington's accusations that China was attempting to change the status quo across the Taiwan Straits as a complete slander,saying it is the US and the Taiwan separatist forces that have broken the status quo

                Wang cited the China-US Joint Communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations released in 1978 as saying the US "recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China" and "acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China"

                Wang also lashed out at Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party for pushing for "incremental independence", engaging in "de-sinicization" and creating " two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" on various occasions

                Gobi Krishnan, who was reportedly sacked from his position in Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu), has urged the party president and leadership to step in over the issue of his removal

                Gobi Krishnan, who is the associate members' wing information chief, also continued to slam the newly appointed associate member’s wing leader, Dr Chong Fat Full, over his sacking

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This is needed, especially since party grassroots nationwide are increasingly questioning Dr Chong’s actions which seem to be opposing the party’s constitution,” said Gobi Krishnan in a statement on Saturday (Aug 6)

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 6 — The statement by Prime Minister’s Special Envoy to China Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing on US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s controversial visit to Taiwan does not reflect the Foreign Ministry’s stand, said Datuk Seri Saifuddin Abdullah
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Local media reported that Tiong in a statement yesterday had condemned Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan as it had added fuel to instability in the region
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was reported saying that Pelosi’s visit was a violation of the One China principle and the Three Joint Communiqués that underline the establishment of relations between the US and China
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Tensions between China and the United States heightened after Pelosi arrived in Taiwan on Tuesday

                China is carrying out its most provocative military drills in decades in the wake of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan this week

                Alongside military exercises, China has imposed trade restrictions on Taiwan

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade rising 26% on year to US$328.3 billion in 2021

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Taiwan held a sizeable surplus against China, with exports from the island exceeding imports by $172 billion, according to Chinese customs data

                While Beijing could leverage that advantage by sanctioning exporters, China also relies on Taiwan for semiconductor supplies.

                Police said former sport and youth minister Roy Suryo's arrest was aimed at preventing him from removing any evidence

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Former sport and youth minister Roy Suryo's arrest, which included the seizure of his Twitter account and mobile phone, was aimed at preventing him from removing any evidence, said police spokesperson Endra Zulpan
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "Investigators decided to detain Roy Suryo Notodiprojo starting tonight as a suspect in a hate speech case," Zulpan told reporters at a press conference on Friday (Aug 5)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Suryo commented at the time that the edited pictures of the leader's face on a statue at the Unesco World Heritage Site were "funny"
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A Buddhist organisation and a Buddhist man filed separate police reports seeking his arrest

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Suryo, however, is not currently facing charges under that law.

                “Our messaging approach to the Malay community is that we are not against them,” said Loke on his plans to boost support from the community

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                DAP has long struggled to find a foothold in the Malay community, with its enemies branding it a chauvinist party over its struggle for Chinese language and education
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                These values have to be communicated to the Malay community.”  He told FMT in a special interview that there was no magic formula to increase Malay support and the party must continue engaging the Malays and ensure more diversity in the party leadership
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                We need to groom more from all communities including the Malay community in order for DAP to become a real multiracial party,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Loke also rejected the notion that DAP was a “bogeyman” among Malays, saying the party was just a “natural punching bag” for Malay-based parties

                Taking to Facebook, Najib called out several quarters for their criticisms and proposed solutions to the troubled project

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He suggested the project be stopped completely

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This, after RM6 billion had been spent and with the project being 60% complete,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Instead, Najib said, the best way forward was to re-evaluate and control the cost and progress of the project more carefully so that the ships could be completed and delivered

                “I have never been under investigation or called to give a statement to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).” He then highlighted that the project had been investigated by a government committee in 2018, when Pakatan Harapan (PH) was in power, and by the police after Boustead Naval Shipyard lodged a police report in December 2020

                The products under the latest recall are the 100ml version of the brand's Belgian Chocolate ice cream, which expires on June 8, 2023, and the 473ml version of its Cookies & Cream ice cream, which expires on May 27 next year

                The KLIA Immigration Operations head was said to have been at the receiving end because there were no Immigration officers stationed at the VIP lane between 8.40am and 9.40am on Wednesday (Aug 3)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Public Service Department (PSD) meanwhile dismissed claims that its director-general publicly berated an Immigration officer in public and described such allegations as baseless and maliciously intended to tarnish his image as a high-ranking government official.

                Amnesty made the comments in a report published on Thursday that drew fierce criticism from the Ukrainian government

                Amnesty's Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said on Facebook late on Friday that she was resigning as she opposed the report's publication, and now understood that she could not get it changed or removed

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Calvin, her eldest son, had been in an accident, and the mother-of-five's first instinct was to rush to the hospital

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Stadium Merdeka is where the independence of then-Malaya was declared in 1957 and where Malaysia's formation was proclaimed in 1963

                To complete the whole experience, Tengku Ab Aziz says that visitors will not exit the Merdeka 118 building when they are done with their tour of the observation deck

                Instead, they will take the lift and come out at the third floor of the upcoming new mall at the base of the Merdeka 118 tower

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                MCA spokesman Chan Quin Er said the Dewan Rakyat should consider amending the constitution so that overseas-born children could obtain citizenship from “either parent” or “either mother or father” or “both mother and father”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The statements from the MCA and DAP leaders came in the wake of an appeal court ruling today upholding the current law that children derive citizenship from their Malaysian fathers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court overturned a High Court ruling in September in which judge Akhtar Tahir had held that mothers were entitled to confer citizenship by operation of law in all processes, just like fathers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the Court of Appeal ruled by a 2-1 majority today that the word “father” is “clear and unambiguous” and could not be construed to include “mother”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It held that children born overseas to Malaysian mothers can be denied citizenship
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Today’s court decision came in an appeal by the government, the home minister and the director-general of the national registration department against the High Court ruling in September

                "President Yoon’s vacation schedule and Speaker Pelosi’s visit to the Republic of Korea overlapped, and we did not rearrange our schedule,” his office said in a statement

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yoon was the only leader not to meet Pelosi in person during her high-stakes Asia trip, which included becoming the highest-level US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years, as well as the first sitting House speaker to visit South Korea in about 20 years

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During her brief stop in South Korea, Pelosi and her congressional delegation met lawmakers at parliament in Seoul, where they agreed to work to end North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons

                Yoon’s support rate hit a record low of 24% in a weekly tracking poll released Friday by Gallup Korea, with the approval numbers of his administration ranking among the lowest for any president at the same point in their term since South Korea became a full democracy in 1987

                Malaysia's inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, increased 3.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) in June, led by costlier food, the Department of Statistics Malaysia said on July 22

                Wan Ahmad also said the finance minister did not enjoy unfettered discretion in deciding whether to approve the tax incentive application by the company

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lawyer S Saravana Kumar submitted that the company had met all conditions imposed and, as such, the finance minister’s decision to reject the application was erroneous in law

                The lawyer said this was the first case of its kind where the finance minister’s refusal to grant a tax incentive was successfully challenged by the taxpayer, and one that involved a multi-billion ringgit tax incentive claim

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 5 — Rafizi Ramli has reportedly said he plans to contest in the Pandan seat that he previously held, replacing Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who won it in 2018

                Donal Crotty, chairman of the Irish Chamber of Commerce Malaysia, said it appeared that the government had no “real commitment” to the programme, and Center for Market Education CEO Carmelo Ferlito said Putrajaya had sent a message that it sought to attract only people of high net worth

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The MM2H programme is aimed at drawing foreigners for long-term stay in Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yesterday, home minister Hamzah Zainudin told the Dewan Rakyat that 1,461 people applied to withdraw from the programme between September last year and June this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Hamzah claimed that the withdrawals were not due to the new conditions the government had set

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Crotty said the MM2H was originally built on trust, confidence and security, and the government’s policy changes were detrimental to the programme

                Tengku Zafrul said that while he is confident that Malaysia will have positive economic growth at least until the third quarter of this year, the country must be prepared for a slowdown in the global economy

                "We are an open economy, trade to GDP is 120 per cent,” he said in reference to Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) being highly dependent on international trade, during a live interview with CNN last night

                Last month, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)said the outlook for the global economy had “darkened significantly” since April and she could not rule out a possible global recession next year given the elevated risks

                “In the matter of Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA), which in fact introduced Jho Low to the Sultan, it was however insignificant, as there was no impropriety or corruption in this act, or of being acquainted with Jho Low,” she said in her witness statement

                When explaining her knowledge of Jho Low surrounding the founding of TIA, she said from her research, she knew that Jho Low had links to the royal family of Terengganu, which led to the founding of TIA and later renamed as 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Prior to 1MDB’s scandal rising to Malaysian public awareness in 2015, Jho Low himself had made it publicly known since 2010 of his involvement in the founding of TIA, through the Sultan of Terengganu

                She further said that Jho Low had links to members of the royal family of Terengganu and this was undisputed public knowledge, as he was friendly with members of that family back in 2009, and was introduced to the Sultan of Terengganu through its members, a fact that Jho Low himself had publicly admitted, without controversy

                “It was also important to know how Jho Low (prior to becoming publicised as a ‘playboy’ or having the ability to abuse positions of trust and power) first became involved in TIA in 2009 and obtained the role of special advisor to the Sultan of Terengganu
