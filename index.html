                Puad Zarkashi said the RoS promised to inform the party on the status of the application by July 16
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If the amendment is approved, Umno will be allowed to postpone its party elections by up to six months after a general election or up to 18 months from the end of its leadership’s term, whichever comes later
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Puad said the RoS had tarnished its credibility by taking so much time on a simple matter “RoS has no right to dictate an organisation or political party’s constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This is the right of any registered organisation,” he said, adding Umno had followed the book in amending its constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This is not about Umno wanting to postpone polls, this is about Umno amending its constitution

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If other parties can get a response (to their application) within a week, why does Umno have to wait so long

                Teow, who is on the Interpol red notice list, is wanted in connection with a RM336 million (US$83 million) money-laundering scam in Macau

                Malaysian police secretary Noorsiah Mohd Saaduddin said Teow is being investigated for cheating and the police “are in the process of applying for the individual to be repatriated to Malaysia to assist in investigations”

                The 55-year-old Teow, founder of MBI Group International, operated entertainment complexes, including a resort in Danok at the Thailand-Malaysia border, and also built a business empire from dubious online investment schemes that attracted investors from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Macau

                Pejuang’s Youth wing information chief Akif Rusli said Apandi’s position as a “middleman” for Jho Low begged the question as to whether he had received any payment to help arrange the meeting

                “There are elements of treason since Apandi was responsible (as the AG at the time) for determining whether Najib would be investigated, and now Najib has been proven guilty at the High Court and Court of Appeal.” Akif pointed out that Jho Low’s alleged RM1.5 billion offer to the government to settle the charges against him were a mere 10% compared to the current RM15.8 billion suit against him by 1MDB and its four subsidiaries

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 — Lawyer Gobind Singh Deo today challenged the validity of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) investigation on Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman after an investigator appeared ignorant of basic facts relevant to his fraud trial
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nurul could not recall when she spoke to Syed Saddiq’s father or name the officer who was in charge of speaking to Syed Saddiq during the investigation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She also disagreed with Gobind that during an election, money could be advanced and reimbursed later despite being shown several related payments
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As Gobind maintained the line of questioning, Nurul Hidayah began repeating her previous answers regardless of the question
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During cross examination earlier today, Nurul insisted that RM100,000 from this went from Maybank Islamic Bhd account belonging to Armada Bumi Bersatu Enterprise (ABBE) into Syed Saddiq’s personal bank account in two payments of RM50,000
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Syed Saddiq also faces two counts of engaging in money laundering activities, namely two transactions of RM50,000, believed to be proceeds of unlawful activities, from his Maybank Islamic Bhd account into his Amanah Saham Bumiputera account, on June 16 and 19, 2018

                At 29, Dusty is in a wheelchair and severely impacted by Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a muscle-wasting disease that affects one in 3,500 boys
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When Dusty was diagnosed with the rare condition in the 1990s, Jayasuriya founded Coalition Duchenne, a non-profit organisation that aims to raise global awareness and funding for the condition

                She has brought over 750 climbers to Sabah to raise funds and awareness for Duchenne muscular dystrophy

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Dusty and the challenges faced by people with Duchenne have inspired Ravi Everest, Coalition Duchenne’s official climbing partner, to become involved with the cause

                Lawyer Joshua Tan said judge Nik Hasmat Nik Mohamed granted the application after an online proceeding today

                “The defendant cannot post the same or similar articles on its news portal until the final determination of the suit,” said Joshua who appeared with Ragunath Kesavan for Ismail

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lawyer Asiah Abdul Jalil represented Agenda Daily and its owner, Izwan Mohd Zubit, as defendants in the suit

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail filed the suit in February against the defendant for publishing an article titled “Ismail Sabri bimbang jadi PM paling singkat, ‘rayu’ jangan tarik sokongan”, saying it implied that he had begged his Perikatan Nasional allies for their continued support
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his statement of claim, Ismail said the posting, in its ordinary meaning and by inference, meant that he was concerned about ending up as the prime minister with the shortest tenure in Malaysian history

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 — Residents of Desa Sri Hartamas and Segambut MP Hannah Yeoh gathered today to object to a proposed development plan that they say will contribute to the traffic congestion in the area
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The noticeboard also displayed a picture suggesting a high-rise office building and a condominium will be built on the land
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “There’s no way a higher plot ratio here will increase the quality of life of our residents because of the congestion that is already here,” she added
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is understood that the proposed development plan involves land with a water sewage facility
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Multiple local representatives also spoke about the negative impact that a high-density development plan would have on the already congested road

                In addition, president of Desa Sri Hartamas Owners and Traders Association Abu Bakar Ibrahim said that DBKL should conduct a traffic impact assessment, environment impact assessment, and social impact assessment of the proposed development plan to make sure that the neighbourhood remains liveable

                According to a statement issued on Saturday (July 22) by Nunukan Immigration officer Saut Dompak, the six men had claimed to be looking into the possibility of building a bridge from Sebatik to Tawau

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                One of the Indonesians arrested reportedly had two sets of identification documents, an Indonesian passport and a Malaysian identity card

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Initial investigations indicated that the Indonesian with two sets of papers had invited the China national and Malaysians to look at the possibility of building a bridge from Tawau to Sebatik on July 20
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Indonesian navy officers found photographs of sensitive areas of their border post and marine headquarters in Sebatik

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The officers then handed the men over to Immigration officers in Nunukan for further investigations on July 21

                TODAY also asked if ICA is considering a review of its policy of not checking 100 per cent of outgoing vehicles at the border checkpoints
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In response, ICA said that Singapore’s land checkpoints are one of the busiest land crossings in the world, and about 200,000 travellers depart daily prior to the coronavirus pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Any delay in clearing departure traffic during peak hours can cause traffic tailback onto the roads inland, such as the Bukit Timah Expressway for Woodlands Checkpoint and the Ayer Rajah Expressway for Tuas Checkpoint, said ICA
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                ICA said that it adopts a “risk management approach” to departure clearance screening of people, goods and conveyances and takes an “arrival-centric approach” to border security, which ICA added is a common practice internationally and done to optimise resources
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This is why the approach to departure checks changes based on Singapore’s prevailing security posture, ICA said in its response
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                About Us Advertise LONDON, July 25 — Rishi Sunak yesterday promised to get tough on China if he becomes Britain’s next prime minister, calling the Asian superpower the “number one threat” to domestic and global security
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s state-run Global Times has previously said Sunak was the only candidate in the contest with “a clear and pragmatic view on developing UK-China ties”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yet British government policy when both Sunak and Truss were in Johnson’s cabinet has warned about China before
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In March last year, its integrated review of security, defence and foreign policy called China “the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At the same time, London has recognised that China’s power and international assertiveness was here to stay, and called Beijing a “systemic competitor”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In July last year, Sunak himself called for a more nuanced approach to the debate on China

                He said a statement had been released a few hours ago to rebuke Lim's statement but he was adamant about his mistake and chose to attack him for not seeing the 12,000 road fatalities allegedly caused by mat rempit

                She said the public can only exercise their citizen’s right to arrest a suspect under Section 27 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) when an offence occurs, and they must immediately hand the suspect to the police instead of causing injuries to the detainee

                “The lessons from Covid-19 remain relevant for monkeypox,” global health specialist Dr Khor Swee Kheng said, adding that WHO’s announcement of monkeypox as a “public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)” highlighted the vigilance that countries needed to adopt against the disease

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Public health expert Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar urged the health authorities to embark on a strict epidemiological surveillance of monkeypox cases and develop appropriate prevention plans

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Public awareness of monkeypox should also be increased,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Epidemiological surveillance involves the health authorities conducting ongoing systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health data essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practices

                China’s state-run Global Times has previously said Sunak was the only candidate in the contest with “a clear and pragmatic view on developing UK-China ties”

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sunak’s proposals include the closure of all 30 Confucius Institutes in Britain, preventing the soft-power spread of Chinese influence through culture and language programmes

                Yet British government policy when both Sunak and Truss were in Johnson’s cabinet has warned about China before

                In March last year, its integrated review of security, defence and foreign policy called China “the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security”

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At the same time, London has recognised that China’s power and international assertiveness was here to stay, and called Beijing a “systemic competitor”

                The basis that Azam has adopted in dismissing any perception that Malaysia’s standing in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (TI-CPI) is alarming and should instead be seen as “I’m alright, Jack, the lark is on the wing” is perhaps as heartening as his other famous statement that “I was doing it for my brother”

                "Kalibr missiles destroyed Odesa port's military infrastructure, sending a Ukrainian military boat to the Kiev regime's favourite address in a precision strike," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The "favourite address" is an ironic reference to the exhortations of Ukrainian forces on Snake Island in the Black Sea who reportedly told a Russian ship to "go f***" itself before a Russian strike in February
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy denounced the strikes on Odesa as blatant "barbarism" that showed Moscow could not be trusted to implement Friday's deal, mediated by Turkey and the United Nations
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Ukrainian military had said Russian missiles hit the southern port on Saturday

                He said the tripartite agreement involving the then Sultan of Sulu, Sultan Jamal Al Alam, the then maharaja of Sabah, Baron de Overbeck, and British North Borneo Company’s Alfred Dent was written in Malay using the Jawi script
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The agreement has no reference for parties to resolve any dispute of North Borneo (Sabah) by way of arbitration,” he told FMT
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the 2019 letter to the lawyer of the Sulu heirs sighted by FMT, Thomas attached a copy of a 1939 judgment by the North Borneo High Court and said Malaysia did not dispute the identity of the individuals and their right to be paid
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Firoz said Malaysia had no choice but to set aside the award but it was going to be a “challenging” task because of Article 5 of the New York Convention
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under the agreement, Jamal ceded sovereignty over large parts of Sabah to Dent and Overbeck, who agreed that they and their future heirs were to pay the heirs of the sultan 5,000 Mexican dollars annually
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Although Malaysia took over these payments when it became the successor of the agreement following Sabah’s independence and the formation of Malaysia in 1963, these payments – equivalent to RM5,300 a year – ceased in 2013 after an incursion by armed men into Lahad Datu, along the eastern coast of Sabah

                The family of Kim Shih Keat, 36, have called for an inquest to be held and for a joint investigation by the police, the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission and the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam)

                Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh said it was important for the police to release the post-mortem report as the family could look into the possibility of an inquest
