                The video wastes no time and starts by showing off the last few steps in the production cycle of the Galaxy Z Fold 4

            <p>

            <p>
                After Samsung is done with the rudimentary tests, the firm moves towards durability tests on the Galaxy Z Fold 4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first test checks the water resistance using a specialized chamber
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Devices that survive this test are then sent to the folding test bench where a robotic arm is responsible for folding and unfolding the phone so it can rule out any issues with the folding mechanism or the hinge itself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is another specialized robot that is responsible for testing the side keys by pressing them repeatedly and the entire testing process ends with another water resistance test where the nozzles spray water at high pressure at unfolded Galaxy Z Fold 4 from all the angles and once that is done, the phone is completely submerged
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the video does not show the Galaxy Z Flip 4 going through the same test, it does appear in the last water resistance test, which is enough reason for us to believe that Samsung is treating both phones the same way, and is pretty confident in the durability of these devices

                We should know for sure soon, as we expect a lot of official info on the next Assassin's Creed game as part of Ubisoft Forward on September 10

                Earlier today, the Twitter account seen below published the two images depicting a prominent character from Assassin's Creed Mirage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What we can potentially glean from these images is that the new Assassin's Creed game might feature a quest called "The Forty Thieves." From the depiction of the quest in the new artwork, it seems this is a DLC quest, perhaps even a pre-order bonus for Ubisoft's upcoming game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either way, it could well be the case that both Assassin's Creed Mirage and this new Forty Thieves quest are unveiled by Ubisoft next week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company is scheduled to hold a presentation on Saturday, September 10, and it's this event that's been heralded as unveiling the "future of Assassin's Creed." We can hardly think of a more convenient event for Mirage's grand debut.  There's also a rumoured stealth-focused Assassin's Creed spin-off game in the works from Ubisoft, which could be separate from Mirage.  Hirun Cryer is a freelance reporter and writer with Gamesradar+ based out of U.K

                In response, Microsoft Gaming CEO and head of Xbox Phil Spencer has spelled out Microsoft’s position in a blog post today

                Detailing Microsoft’s plans for gaming beyond just Xbox consoles, Spencer says the company will pursue a “principled path” in its approach to Xbox Game Pass and Call of Duty

                “That’s why, as we’ve said before, we are committed to making the same version of Call of Duty available on PlayStation on the same day the game launches elsewhere.” Spencer likens Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal to the company’s $2.5 billion acquisition of Minecraft

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The publisher did express that DLC for single-player titles on PC, such as Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, Assassin’s Creed III (2012 release), Far Cry 3 and Splinter Cell Blacklist, will still be available to download and keep before the decommission date
            </p>

                Ubisoft also states, “There will be no impact to the same single-player DLC on consoles, and you will continue to be able to download and play them after 1 October 2022”

                Lenovo kicked off IFA 2022 with two tablets and the second generation of its folding laptop - the ThinkPad X1 Fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's a big improvement over the first-gen 13.3-inch X1 Fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can use the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 as a 16.3-inch free-standing monitor with a Bluetooth keyboard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can, of course, use the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 as a huge tablet if you wish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 weighs 1.28kg for the display only, and 1.9kg with the keyboard and stand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lenovo will ask $2,499 for the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 when it begins shipping in November

            <p>
                Lenovo kicked off IFA 2022 with two tablets and the second generation of its folding laptop - the ThinkPad X1 Fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's a big improvement over the first-gen 13.3-inch X1 Fold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can use the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 as a 16.3-inch free-standing monitor with a Bluetooth keyboard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can, of course, use the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 as a huge tablet if you wish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 weighs 1.28kg for the display only, and 1.9kg with the keyboard and stand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lenovo will ask $2,499 for the ThinkPad X1 Fold 2022 when it begins shipping in November

                Signify is making further inroads with the gaming community with its new lineup of Philips Hue Play gradient lightstrips for PCs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Much like the 55-inch Play lightstrip explicitly made for TVs, the PC versions of the Play lightstrips provide flexible accent lighting that attaches to the back of your monitor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new family of Play lightstrips can sync with other connected lighting in the Philips Hue ecosystem and will be available starting September 13th
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Play lightstrips for PC will be compatible with the existing Hue Sync desktop app and can work with the Play Sync box from Philips Hue, just like the larger lightstrips used with TVs, but they don’t require it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will also connect with Corsair’s iCue lighting software
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The software allows you to synchronize existing lighting effects on your PC and connected peripherals with the Play lightstrips

            <p>
                Signify is making further inroads with the gaming community with its new lineup of Philips Hue Play gradient lightstrips for PCs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Much like the 55-inch Play lightstrip explicitly made for TVs, the PC versions of the Play lightstrips provide flexible accent lighting that attaches to the back of your monitor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new family of Play lightstrips can sync with other connected lighting in the Philips Hue ecosystem and will be available starting September 13th
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Play lightstrips for PC will be compatible with the existing Hue Sync desktop app and can work with the Play Sync box from Philips Hue, just like the larger lightstrips used with TVs, but they don’t require it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will also connect with Corsair’s iCue lighting software
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The software allows you to synchronize existing lighting effects on your PC and connected peripherals with the Play lightstrips
            </p>

                Rosmah Mansor, wife of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, arrives at the Kuala Lumpur Court Complex to attend a verdict hearing in a corruption case against her, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia September 1, 2022

                (Pocket-lint) - Samsung has announced the Galaxy Tab Active 4 Pro tablet, designed to be tough enough to use outside of the office, wherever you might fancy working
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tablet features MIL-STD-810H military-grade toughness and Samsung claims it is "tough enough to endure even the most demanding work environments"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Did someone say beach working? - The Galaxy Tab Active 4 Pro offers a 10.2mm frame, weighs 674g and it features Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There's a replaceable 7600mAh battery on board, as well as fast charging, and there's also a No Battery Mode that allows the tablet to be used continuously at a kiosk or in a vehicle without the battery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 4 Pro runs on Android 12.0 out of the box and Samsung will offer five years of security updates and three years of OS updates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Galaxy Tab Active 4 Pro will be available starting September in parts of Europe, with availability in Asia, Latin America, North America and the Middle East to follow later this year

                Darwin Nunez endured a nightmare home debut for Liverpool when he was dismissed for violent conduct against Crystal Palace and received a three-match domestic suspension Liverpool fans were hoping for a goal in front of the Kop when Darwin Nunez made his Anfield debut against Crystal Palace last month

                Do you think Darwin Nunez will be a success at Liverpool? Let us know in the comments below! "With what happened to him the other day I was talking to him because he is just starting out and to make him aware that from now on, opponents will be seeking him out twice or three times more often," said Suarez after Nunez's headbutt last month

                Darwin Nunez endured a nightmare home debut for Liverpool when he was dismissed for violent conduct against Crystal Palace and received a three-match domestic suspension Liverpool fans were hoping for a goal in front of the Kop when Darwin Nunez made his Anfield debut against Crystal Palace last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez could do with listening to Luis Suarez's advice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Do you think Darwin Nunez will be a success at Liverpool? Let us know in the comments below! "With what happened to him the other day I was talking to him because he is just starting out and to make him aware that from now on, opponents will be seeking him out twice or three times more often," said Suarez after Nunez's headbutt last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wednesday narrow win shows how much Liverpool need a prolific scorer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nunez must have a similar impact if Liverpool are going to challenge for honours this term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool fans will hope their former star is right

                As highlighted by our reader recently, Maxis postpaid customers are charged RM15 for making or answering a single voice call while travelling overseas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This exorbitant charge is due to Maxis’ 1 Day Calls and SMS Unlimited Pass, which is activated automatically when you make or receive a call, or after sending more than 3 SMS in a day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This mandatory auto-activation of RM15 per day is only applicable to customers of the current Maxis Postpaid plans while customers on older postpaid as well as Hotlink prepaid and postpaid, are still charged based on pay-per-use, which is more appropriate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our intention for the unlimited Call & SMS daily pass was for everyone to enjoy worry free unlimited calls and SMS capped at RM15, not just incoming calls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ideally, Maxis should charge users based on their current pay-per-use rate until the total usage reaches a specific threshold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since postpaid customers are already paying a premium, it would be nice if all telcos provide a decent amount of roaming data and voice minutes for a hassle-free and bill-shock-free experience.

                Rafizi was responding to questions on his reaction to being called up by the police to give his statement following his accusation linking Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Special Functions) Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad to alleged financial misconduct in relation to the RM9 billion LCS procurement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had earlier asked the police to launch an investigation into the scandal but was met with a counter-complaint filed by an aide of Dr Abdul Latiff, who is also the Mersing MP, yesterday for alleged defamation

            <p>

                Despite the fact that the P11 (2nd Gen) won't arrive until early 2023, this is the first tablet to be announced with Android 12L onboard

                Considering that Lenovo's Tab P12 Pro was one of the only tablets available for the Android 12L developer preview and Android 13 Beta Program, it makes perfect sense to see at least one of Lenovo's latest tablets equipped with the tablet-centric operating system

            <p>
                Not to be confused with their predecessors, Lenovo is launching the Tab P11 (2nd Gen) and Tab P11 Pro (2nd Gen)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the fact that the P11 (2nd Gen) won't arrive until early 2023, this is the first tablet to be announced with Android 12L onboard
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Considering that Lenovo's Tab P12 Pro was one of the only tablets available for the Android 12L developer preview and Android 13 Beta Program, it makes perfect sense to see at least one of Lenovo's latest tablets equipped with the tablet-centric operating system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the P11 Pro (2nd Gen), you won't have to wait much longer as Lenovo states the 11.2-inch tablet will be available sometime in September

                For just $30 more, the new Kobo Clara 2E brings better screen lighting that’s easier on the eyes, plus two important upgrades that should put a dent in the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 5's dominance

                The other major upgrade for the Kobo Clara 2E is the addition of Bluetooth, allowing wireless headphones, a wireless speaker, or a wireless connection to a car’s stereo to be used for enjoying audiobook content, which can be downloaded right to the e-reader itself from Kobo’s online store
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kobo also points out that the new Clara 2E’s housing is made from more than 85 percent recycled plastic; 10% of which is (was?) ocean-bound plastic

                Lenovo on Thursday introduced a pair of midrange Android tablets that it hopes will steal market share from Apple's popular iPad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tablet runs Android 12, and Lenovo promises updates through Android 14
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lenovo doesn't say how much battery life to expect from the 7,700mAh cell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This slate ships with Android 12L, the tablet-specific version of Android 12, and should eventually get an upgrade to Android 14
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In November 2021, the iPad held about 59% of the market to Android's 41%

                Much of this new X1 Fold will be familiar to fans not just of the previous X1 Fold, but of the ThinkPad line in general

            <p>
                The 2020 X1 Fold’s keyboard was well-made but had to fit horizontally across a 13.3-inch device, which meant it was really dang cramped
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That, interestingly, is the same price the 13-inch model had (and this is a bigger, thinner, and generally more usable device)

            <p>
                I don’t expect this device to be perfect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I think they understand exactly what the limitations of the 13-inch Fold were and were happy to have a larger foldable screen come along
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maybe in this new form factor, Lenovo can finally make the groundbreaking device that they wanted the first X1 Fold to be

                Much of this new X1 Fold will be familiar to fans not just of the previous X1 Fold, but of the ThinkPad line in general
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 2020 X1 Fold’s keyboard was well-made but had to fit horizontally across a 13.3-inch device, which meant it was really dang cramped
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That, interestingly, is the same price the 13-inch model had (and this is a bigger, thinner, and generally more usable device)

            <p>
                I don’t expect this device to be perfect

            <p>
                I think they understand exactly what the limitations of the 13-inch Fold were and were happy to have a larger foldable screen come along
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maybe in this new form factor, Lenovo can finally make the groundbreaking device that they wanted the first X1 Fold to be

            <p>
                If that is true, then Apple may keep the Max exclusive for the pro variants, whereas the Plus could be for the non-pro variants

            <p>
                Rumours were also consistent that both the alleged iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 14 Pro Max have the exact display measurement of 6.7-inches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Knowing the market in Malaysia, the iPhone 14 Plus could be as popular as the iPhone 14 Pro Max because customers like bigger phones

            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is how the company “invented” the notch, which is a cutout at the top of the screen where all these sensors, plus a microphone and speaker, are placed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, the company relocated the top speaker of the iPhone 13 to make the notch smaller, but it’s still there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This new report claims that Apple will make the two separate cutouts on the iPhone 14 Pro’s screen look like a single cutout
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regular iPhone 14 models are expected to keep the same notch as the iPhone 13

                Samsung Android Tablets Announcement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Back in mid-August a bunch of certifications were issued for the Galaxy Tab Active4 Pro, signifying its imminent launch, and today Samsung has indeed made it official
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Samsung Galaxy Tab Active4 Pro official images The device has support for GPS, 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, NFC, hybrid dual-SIM functionality available in North America only for some reason, and a fingerprint sensor embedded in the Home key
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It runs Android 12 with Samsung's One UI on top.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More Samsung Galaxy Tab Active4 Pro official images The Galaxy Tab Active4 Pro and its S Pen are IP68 rated as protected from dust, dirt, and sand, and can withstand being submerged in up to 1.5m of fresh water for up to 30 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>

                By Dan Coombs  Sergino Dest is set to clinch a move to AC Milan after Manchester United backed away from a potential move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, The Athletic reported yesterday that United had decided not to move for Dest, electing to keep Aaron Wan-Bissaka as back-up right-back instead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He says a loan deal with an option to buy is agreed, and Dest is now set to fly to Milan to seal the move
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dest will sign until June 2027, one year loan plus potential four year deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s unclear whether United decided not to sign Dest simply because they did not want to, or because there was no buyer for Aaron Wan-Bissaka
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even sending Wan-Bissaka on loan and then landing Dest on loan would have felt fairly pointless

                Jurgen Klopp’s injury woes are finally starting to ease after a challenging start to the season for Liverpool, with a number of players returning to training this week Liverpool experienced a horrendous start to the new season and saw 10 players injured following their first three games of the campaign, but things are finally starting to look up for Jurgen Klopp’s men

                Liverpool forward Jota has been sidelined with a thigh injury that he picked up during the pre-season camp in Thailand in July, meaning he has failed to feature for the Reds since the end of last season, but he also made his return to first-team training on Thursday

            <p>
                The 23-year-old picked up the injury following the 1-1 draw with Ukraine on June 14, before feeling the same problem again once he returned to Liverpool’s training base for pre-season

                Elden Ring wasn’t just a hit with fans of FromSoftware’s notoriously difficult action-RPGs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today’s announcement from FromSoft’s parent company Kadokawa revealed that Sony and Tencent are acquiring 14.09% and 16.25% of FromSoft, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement indicates that Kadokawa wants FromSoftware to be able to expand its development efforts; Kadokawa sees the “enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment of [FromSoft] game IP as one of the [Kadokawa] Group’s highest priorities.” One of the aims is to give FromSoft the resources needed to grow Elden Ring into a franchise that extends beyond just video games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elden Ring was a long time coming, built on a foundation first laid down in FromSoftware’s pioneering 2009 PS3 game Demon’s Souls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It owns 5% of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry publisher Ubisoft, completed an acquisition of League of Legends’ developer Riot Games, owns 40% of Epic Games, and has stakes in many, many, many, many other game companies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sony has also been on a spending spree too, though it looks a bit more modest compared to Tencent

                CHELSEA’S new £12.6million midfielder Cesare Casadei became the latest Blue to see red
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Casadei, 19, was snapped up by Chelsea from Inter Milan this month after being targeted by Arsenal

            <p>
                And Casadei lined up in Chelsea’s development side for tonight’s cup clash against Sutton

            <p>
                The Mexican anchorman has already snubbed a move to Newcastle this summer but would jump at the chance to join Chelsea

            <p>
                Also, seeing as Google appears to be much further into its development process, the company is now calling the new page a "welcome screen" for ChromeOS

            <p>
                As far as navigating out of the welcome screen, it seems it'll disappear as soon as you click on one of your apps to start your session

            <p>
                However, as 9to5 notes, Google apparently isn't sure just yet how to bring back the welcome screen after you've clicked out of it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While we're still most likely a ways away from seeing this new welcome screen, 9to5 states there should be a new flag coming to the Chromium Gerrit that will allow eager testers to try out the new change before it releases

            </p>
            
            <p>
                While we're still most likely a ways away from seeing this new welcome screen, 9to5 states there should be a new flag coming to the Chromium Gerrit that will allow eager testers to try out the new change before it releases

                @ChanceHMiller The big Apple news of the day is that the iPhone 14 Pro will apparently use software to make the two new display cutouts look like one seamless cutout

            <p>
                According to a source familiar with Apple’s plans, the company will use this space to make its privacy indicators for the camera and microphone more visible

            <p>
                On the iPhone 14 Pro, Apple will move these indicators and make them far more visible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will also allow Apple to show both the green and orange dots at the same time when the camera and microphone are both in use

                Security researchers revealed they uncovered a massive hole in TikTok’s security that affected every single user who has downloaded the app on Android devices worldwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if there is any lingering hint that any users were impacted by this “high severity” security exploit, then TikTok isn’t telling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Microsoft 365 Defender researchers reported Wednesday on a serious vulnerability in the Android version of the TikTok app, one that could have allowed bad actors to potentially gain access to all aspects of a user’s account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The researchers said they revealed the exploit to TikTok back in February through its vulnerability reporting page
            </p>

                Security researchers revealed they uncovered a massive hole in TikTok’s security that affected every single user who has downloaded the app on Android devices worldwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if there is any lingering hint that any users were impacted by this “high severity” security exploit, then TikTok isn’t telling

            <p>
                Microsoft 365 Defender researchers reported Wednesday on a serious vulnerability in the Android version of the TikTok app, one that could have allowed bad actors to potentially gain access to all aspects of a user’s account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The researchers said they revealed the exploit to TikTok back in February through its vulnerability reporting page

                There’s a new compatibility shim, which allows apps to be resized while still maintaining their aspect ratio, instead of trying to stretch them to fit the aspect ratio of the window that contains them

            <p>
                Still on the topic of compatibility, Microsoft has added some new educative dialog for game controls in games that have compatibility shims enabled

            <p>
                Every other update is fairly minor, though there’s also a new security update for Android, and the Amazon Appstore itself has been updated to version 60.09

                Apple is cutting one iPhone model (the mini) and adding one (the vanilla Max), so a shake-up in the pricing structure is to be expected

                Of course, last year there was the iPhone 13 mini for $700 as the cheapest new (non-SE) model

            <p>
                Analysts agree that the new iPhone 14 Max will cost $100 more than the vanilla model, which will put its price at $850 or $900, depending on exactly which analysts are right
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no consensus on whether it’s by $50 or by $100 (TrendForce says $50), but that new hardware doesn’t come cheap

                The Dell XPS 13 Plus laptop released this year was billed as the fancier version of one of the most well-known thin-and-light laptops, the Dell XPS 13
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dell's rep said that once the issue with the adhesive was discovered, Dell corrected its production process, so other units should not be affected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dell's spokesperson said the company is directly contacting customers who bought an OLED Dell XPS 13 Plus from Dell's website and may be impacted. Dell said it will also contact those who purchased a Dell XPS 13 Plus from a retailer and then registered the PC with Dell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If a customer has not registered their system, the first time they contact Dell technical support, the unique service tag associated with their computer will identify to Dell technical support that the system should be repaired or replaced," Dell's spokesperson said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For customers who believe their computer is affected or if you have any questions, please contact Dell customer support." Dell said it is also working with retail partners to replace units Dell sold to them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As is typical for Dell laptops, the XPS 13 Plus has a one-year warranty in the US

                The Dell XPS 13 Plus laptop released this year was billed as the fancier version of one of the most well-known thin-and-light laptops, the Dell XPS 13
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dell's rep said that once the issue with the adhesive was discovered, Dell corrected its production process, so other units should not be affected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dell's spokesperson said the company is directly contacting customers who bought an OLED Dell XPS 13 Plus from Dell's website and may be impacted. Dell said it will also contact those who purchased a Dell XPS 13 Plus from a retailer and then registered the PC with Dell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If a customer has not registered their system, the first time they contact Dell technical support, the unique service tag associated with their computer will identify to Dell technical support that the system should be repaired or replaced," Dell's spokesperson said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "For customers who believe their computer is affected or if you have any questions, please contact Dell customer support." Dell said it is also working with retail partners to replace units Dell sold to them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As is typical for Dell laptops, the XPS 13 Plus has a one-year warranty in the US

                Right now, you can take advantage of a deal at  GameStop,  where the 128GB Quest 2 is only $300, and the 256GB model is available for $400

                Amazon  was also offering the discount on the 128GB model but ran out of stock very quickly

                It's worth mentioning that Meta is expected to launch a high-end headset (Project Cambria) in the near future, which will likely be quite a bit more expensive than the Quest 2, in case you feel like being patient.

                First up is a new ringtone for Oktoberfest, which is launching on the battery-powered Nest doorbell for the first time

            <p>
                The spooky ringtones will be available between October 1 and November 1

                Google will also launch Diwali-themed ringtones from October 7 to October 28

            <p>
                Later, there will be ringtones for the Lunar New Year as well

            <p>
                Because of its wire-free design, Google's new battery-powered Nest Doorbell can work with any door

            <p>
                First up is a new ringtone for Oktoberfest, which is launching on the battery-powered Nest doorbell for the first time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The spooky ringtones will be available between October 1 and November 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google didn't specify what spooky ringtones are coming later this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google will also launch Diwali-themed ringtones from October 7 to October 28
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Later, there will be ringtones for the Lunar New Year as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because of its wire-free design, Google's new battery-powered Nest Doorbell can work with any door
            </p>

                Finally, the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED can be used as a conventional laptop with a magnetically-attachable physical keyboard and only half of its display at 12.5-inch and 1920x1280px.

                First announced during CES 2022, Asus has now officially revealed the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED, a giant touchscreen tablet that can be folded down to a 12.5-inch ‘laptop’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Zenbook 17 Fold OLED will also come with Windows 11 Home out of the box
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another thing worth noting is that, because there’s no actual physical keyboard on the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED, the device comes with the Asus ErgoSense Bluetooth keyboard and touchpad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Zenbook 17 Fold OLED weighs just 1.5kg without the keyboard, while with the keyboard it weighs 1.8kg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED will be available in Malaysia by the end of the year, and will be priced at an eye-watering RM14,999
            </p>

                The Beosound Theatre is an all-in-one sound system containing 12 speaker drivers, including two custom-made, long-stroke 6.5-inch woofers

                The Beosound Theatre interface bracket — most people would call it a TV stand — itself also includes a compartment where you can hide cables and TV boxes from view

                The Beosound Theatre will be available in a range of finishes and customizations, though details on these have not yet been provided

            <p>
                The wall mount required is thankfully included with the Beosound Theatre, in addition to a separate stand for the soundbar to rest on a table or desk

            <p>
                The aluminum “wings” are also extendable so that, according to Bang & Olufsen, almost any TV can be slotted into the Beosound Theatre

                The Beosound Theatre is an all-in-one sound system containing 12 speaker drivers, including two custom-made, long-stroke 6.5-inch woofers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can also replace the soundbar later (as well as your TV) later if it suits you

            <p>
                The Beosound Theatre interface bracket — most people would call it a TV stand — itself also includes a compartment where you can hide cables and TV boxes from view
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Beosound Theatre will be available in a range of finishes and customizations, though details on these have not yet been provided
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The wall mount required is thankfully included with the Beosound Theatre, in addition to a separate stand for the soundbar to rest on a table or desk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The aluminum “wings” are also extendable so that, according to Bang & Olufsen, almost any TV can be slotted into the Beosound Theatre

                VIVE is holding a UK sales event until September 11 where you can save £100 on the Cosmos Elite VR headset, and save more on other models too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Readers in the UK can save £100 on the VIVE Cosmos Elite VR headset when you grab it from VIVE's website until September 11.  Right now, you can get the HTC VIVE Cosmos Elite VR headset for just £349 (opens in new tab), down from the usual price of £449
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As VR headset deals go, this one is pretty solid.  While this deal is for the headset only, the VIVE Cosmos Elite is hailed as one of the most customizable and compatible models on the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There's also a host of other great deals (opens in new tab) on VIVE's website which will be highlighted below.  VIVE Cosmos Elite VR Headset Was £449 now £349 on VIVE (opens in new tab).  Save £100 on a VR headset that features in our best VR headset guide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If that wasn't enough for you, you also get two months of Viveport Infinity membership included with the headset.  But, this is a sales event that VIVE are offering so to have just one headset discounted wouldn't be enough
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can also enjoy £100 off the VIVE Cosmos (opens in new tab), the VIVE Pro headset (opens in new tab) and the VIVE Pro Full Kit (opens in new tab)

                The national 5G company, Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) has confirmed that there were indeed some last-minute changes to its shareholder agreement that was supposed to involve six local telcos
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report further added that Maxis and U Mobile did not see any benefits in having stakes in the national 5G company although both telcos apparently still want to obtain 5G access from DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DNB generally confirmed this through its media statement [pdf] which said that one of the six telcos decided not to proceed with the shareholder agreement while another choose not to respond even though they have earlier confirmed their participation in the agreement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, DNB is not able to confirm when this process will be concluded but the company is confident that all four telcos will continue to be on board

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Initially, Sony hoped to begin shipping the HT-A5000 in Europe from January 2022

            <p>
                According to Sony, the HT-A5000 supports the PlayStation 5-specific Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture Mode too, which arrived via a firmware update that Sony released this spring

                The feature is far from perfect and won’t replace the quality of a physical green screen, but we can attest that it does a decent job
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, it was possible to use a virtual green screen in OBS via plugins, but Nvidia Broadcast will make the feature much more accessible

            <p>
                Those who use an Nvidia RTX graphics card could probably already have the software installed, and Nvidia Broadcast also integrates with lots of popular streaming hardware and applications

            <p>
                For example, Corsair integrated Nvidia Broadcast tools into its iCue and Elgato software back in July 2022, allowing those who rely on Corsair or Elgato hardware to utilize certain features such as its impressive background noise suppression

                The Elgato Camera Hub also got access to Virtual Backgrounds at this time, allowing streamers to access Nvidia Broadcast tools without going to the app directly

            <p>
                Virtual Backgrounds is the only Nvidia -specific feature added to the latest version of OBS (version 28.0) but there are other non-Nvidia Broadcast features coming to the service, such as support for high-efficiency video coding (HEVC or H.265) and high-dynamic range (HDR)

                But VGC sources suggest the reveal is unlikely to be related to its biggest classic franchises Konami will announce a new game related to a classic series during next month’s Tokyo Game Show, it’s said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Voice actor Yuji Kaji will be invited as a guest to represent the fans of a series which is loved all over the world, on the announcement stage for a new Konami title,” it reads
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, as he’s seemingly only “representing the fans” of the new game in question, this doesn’t necessarily mean the new title will be related to anything he’s previously starred in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One publishing source told VGC that the reveal is likely to be related to a smaller project, rather than Konami’s larger planned revivals for Castlevania, Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid (the first of which is understood to be furthest along in development), which VGC first reported on last year
            </p>

                Dell also claims the problem is specific to the OLED version of the XPS 13 Plus, with non-OLED versions seemingly unaffected.  If you’ve purchased a Dell XPS 13 Plus OLED already, be sure to keep an eye on the screen for any potential problems

            <p>
                That list just got a little longer, with Dell confirming (via The Verge) (opens in new tab) there is a screen issue on some OLED models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This issue has the screen seemingly coming off the laptop
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dell also claims the problem is specific to the OLED version of the XPS 13 Plus, with non-OLED versions seemingly unaffected.  If you’ve purchased a Dell XPS 13 Plus OLED already, be sure to keep an eye on the screen for any potential problems

                Harry Maguire has not been at his best for the past few seasons at Manchester United, and Cristiano Ronaldo told the club management that he needed to be 'demoted' as a result Cristiano Ronaldo approached former Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick last season to call for Harry Maguire to be dropped

                The two tech giants now own a combined 30% of the studio Sony and Chinese publishing giant Tencent are both set to increase their stake in Elden Ring and Dark Souls developer FromSoftware
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an announcement this morning, FromSoft parent company Kadokawa Corporation - which remains the majority owner of the developer - confirmed that Sony now owns 14.09% of FromSoftware
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond that, attention is likely to turn to Elden Ring - as well as hopes for upcoming Elden Ring DLC, FromSoftware and publisher Bando Namcai have discussed their desire for the title to act as the start of a new franchise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the future of Elden Ring seems in a better space than its more gothic older brother, it's far from clear at this point what we can expect from the deal, and Kadokawa Corporation suggests that the deal's impact on its 2023 financial results is likely to be "minor." This list of new games 2022 should prove a more reliable wishlist

                The two tech giants now own a combined 30% of the studio Sony and Chinese publishing giant Tencent are both set to increase their stake in Elden Ring and Dark Souls developer FromSoftware
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an announcement this morning, FromSoft parent company Kadokawa Corporation - which remains the majority owner of the developer - confirmed that Sony now owns 14.09% of FromSoftware
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond that, attention is likely to turn to Elden Ring - as well as hopes for upcoming Elden Ring DLC, FromSoftware and publisher Bando Namcai have discussed their desire for the title to act as the start of a new franchise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the future of Elden Ring seems in a better space than its more gothic older brother, it's far from clear at this point what we can expect from the deal, and Kadokawa Corporation suggests that the deal's impact on its 2023 financial results is likely to be "minor." This list of new games 2022 should prove a more reliable wishlist

                However, at the same time, we have to admit the fact that a durability test does not always represent the real-life usage of that device in question because, more often than not, you are looking at the tester taking the device to an extreme measure that we certainly will not take

                From lossless audio support to fitness tracking, these are the big upgrades we hope to see on the AirPods Pro 2 Apple's AirPods Pro 2 could well be one of the stars of the Apple September Event that's now confirmed for September 7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While some people will be most excited about possible changes to the AirPods Pro 2's design, that's not how I roll.  As I'm a quality-audio enthusiast, the most exciting feature I'd like to see on the AirPods Pro 2's spec sheet is support for Apple's own ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) format
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, a patent, spotted by Patently Apple (opens in new tab), could enable the AirPods to overcome that problem by instead using optical audio transmission tech.  Regardless of what happens there, the AirPods Pro 2 have been tipped to come with Bluetooth LE Audio support

                This was first hinted at in a 2020 Apple patent, and the AirPods Pro 2 could potentially be the first to harness a new chip with more sophisticated smart processing to enable this functionality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current AirPods Pro manage around 4.5 hours of playback time, but the AirPods 3 can get to 6 hours playback from a single charge — albeit without ANC

                AMD is rumored to launch three new Zen 4 V-Cache CPUs, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, Ryzen 9 7900X3D & Ryzen 7 7800X3D at CES 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latest rumor regarding the Zen 4 V-Cache parts comes from Greymon55 who has put forward a cryptic tweet referring to the Ryzen 7000 3D V-Cache CPUs

            <p>
                According to the tweet, three Ryzen 3D V-Cache CPUs have been rumored, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, Ryzen 9 7900X3D & the Ryzen 7 7800X3D
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We can't say for sure yet if AMD will have a single CCD stacked with a 3D cache stack or if both Zen 4 CCDs will be stacked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In any case, if AMD goes with the existing 64 MB SRAM (3D V-Cache) stack, we will get up to 104 MB cache on the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, up to 140 MB cache on the Ryzen 9 7900X3D, and a whopping 144 MB of cache on the Ryzen 9 7950X3D
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's a 2.6x increase over Ryzen 7 7700X, an 85% increase over the 7900X, and an 80% increase over the Ryzen 9 7950X

                In March 2020, Dr Mahathir came into close contact with Bandar Kuching MP Dr Kelvin Yii who tested positive for Covid-19

                In March 2020, Dr Mahathir came into close contact with Bandar Kuching MP Dr Kelvin Yii who tested positive for Covid-19

                In late July 2021, one of Dr Mahathir's officers was asymptomatic and had tested positive for Covid-19 in a screening at Parliament

                Dr Mahathir tested negative again after the second scare, even though he said he did not have contact with the officer in Parliament

                As for other Android devices, they will only receive the update “later this year”, though many companies have already started rolling out Android 13 beta versions for their smartphones to customers, including Samsung with its popular Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S21 Series.  In fact, the Galaxy S22 Series had actually received Android 13 via One UI 5.0 beta even before Google officially released the final version of Android 13
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Well, it does make sense given how Android 13 beta has been around for ages and the One UI 5.0 is not utilising the final version of the latest Android OS.   Now, Samsung is rolling out the One UI 5.0 beta to the Galaxy S22 Series’ predecessor, the Galaxy S21 Series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Available for download for Galaxy S21 Series users in South Korea and the United Kingdom, the update carries the firmware version G99xBxxU5ZVHE according to SamMobile.  Moreover, the 1957.47MB update is available for all unlocked models of the Galaxy S21 Series which include the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+ and Galaxy S21 Ultra
            </p>

                Well, if you’re a Samsung Galaxy S22 or Galaxy S21 user and are interested to test the Android 13 beta when it’s available in Malaysia, make sure to install the Samsung Members app on your device and log in to the app using your Samsung account

                Here are 3 simple reasons to pick the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G as your next flagship device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The recently launched Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra not only packed in a built-in S Pen, it also comes with the highest-end camera specs of the entire Samsung Galaxy S22 series so it’s safe to assume that the S22 Ultra is every bit a super cameraphone as it’s S21 Ultra predecessor

                Well, if you’re a Samsung Galaxy S22 or Galaxy S21 user and are interested to test the Android 13 beta when it’s available in Malaysia, make sure to install the Samsung Members app on your device and log in to the app using your Samsung account

                Here are 3 simple reasons to pick the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G as your next flagship device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The recently launched Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra not only packed in a built-in S Pen, it also comes with the highest-end camera specs of the entire Samsung Galaxy S22 series so it’s safe to assume that the S22 Ultra is every bit a super cameraphone as it’s S21 Ultra predecessor

                The LC3 audio codec will be able to compress audio more efficiently and it can be configured to use more or less bandwidth such as when there’s suddenly a longer distance between the host device and connected audio

            <p>
                Of course, for any regular consumer to be able to take advantage of this new codec, both the Android smartphone and audio device must support the same codec

            <p>
                Leon Bailey could also come in on the right side of the attack, with Coutinho on the left

                According to Jason Burt of the Telegraph on Twitter, Manchester United could sign a right-back late in the window with both Sergino Dest and Thomas Meunier available on loan deals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But now, they could make a late move for a right-back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Barcelona right-back has been consistently dropped by manager Xavi Hernandez this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He could get some playing time at United, with manager Erik ten Hag seemingly unconvinced by the options that he has right now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both these players could prove to be smart acquisitions in their own right
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dalot hasn’t been too shabby when selected but if Ten Hag has envisioned a different type of right-back for his team, the board would be wise to back him

            <p>
                According to Jason Burt of the Telegraph on Twitter, Manchester United could sign a right-back late in the window with both Sergino Dest and Thomas Meunier available on loan deals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But now, they could make a late move for a right-back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Barcelona right-back has been consistently dropped by manager Xavi Hernandez this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He could get some playing time at United, with manager Erik ten Hag seemingly unconvinced by the options that he has right now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both these players could prove to be smart acquisitions in their own right
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dalot hasn’t been too shabby when selected but if Ten Hag has envisioned a different type of right-back for his team, the board would be wise to back him
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                We’ve been playing for almost four years as partners and sometimes, we think like it is impossible to become champions,” said Wooi Yik
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We will just keep learning and focus on our strengths.” Aaron-Wooi Yik are bracing for a storm of challenges that would come their way with renewed confidence, something that was missing in their career.

                Samsung Android Firmware Updates Beta
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this month, Samsung opened up the public beta for One UI 5 based on Android 13 for the Galaxy S22 series, and today this is now also jumping to the Galaxy S21 devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So far, the beta program seems to have been started for these in Korea and the UK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you're in the UK and want to try your hand at this, note that the beta is currently only available for SIM-free, unlocked units
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will definitely be a bunch of further beta builds for One UI 5.0, and if you're registered into the testing program you'll receive each of those as it's released, as an over-the-air update

                Samsung is on a roll with the One UI 5 (Android 13) beta program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's only been a few weeks since Samsung launched the One UI 5 (Android 13) beta for its flagship Galaxy S22 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's expected that there shouldn't be much difference in software between the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S22, so users can likely expect a similar experience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Keep in mind that this is beta software, so there are likely to be bugs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stable Android 13 is expected to start arriving on Galaxy smartphones later this year, but until then, we expect Samsung will expand its beta program to more of its best Android phones in the coming weeks

                Watch Of The Week The Fine German Watch That Taught Me To Appreciate Asymmetry

            <p>
                It would seem that Bulgari considers the Aluminum line ripe for collaboration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It seems like only yesterday that the rubber-bezel watch was given the Ducati treatment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But time marches ever onward and so do the folks at Bulgari, so here we are with a new collaboration that brings together the time-and-date Aluminum watch with the chrome-heavy aesthetics of Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama.  The watch features a silver-toned dial and "propeller-shaped" hour-markers that are designed to recall Sorayama's work that channels the design of cars and planes from the '30s and '40s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dial text reads "Bulgari" in the top half and "Sorayama" at the bottom half to ward off any confusion as to whether or not this is indeed a collaboration.  Sorayama said of the watch, "When I was asked to be part of this collaboration, I developed three main design elements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sorayama's dream-come-true watch is powered by caliber BVL 192, a mechanical self-winding caliber found in the Aluminum GMT

                Watch Of The Week The Fine German Watch That Taught Me To Appreciate Asymmetry

                It would seem that Bulgari considers the Aluminum line ripe for collaboration
            </p>

                It seems like only yesterday that the rubber-bezel watch was given the Ducati treatment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But time marches ever onward and so do the folks at Bulgari, so here we are with a new collaboration that brings together the time-and-date Aluminum watch with the chrome-heavy aesthetics of Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama.  The watch features a silver-toned dial and "propeller-shaped" hour-markers that are designed to recall Sorayama's work that channels the design of cars and planes from the '30s and '40s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dial text reads "Bulgari" in the top half and "Sorayama" at the bottom half to ward off any confusion as to whether or not this is indeed a collaboration.  Sorayama said of the watch, "When I was asked to be part of this collaboration, I developed three main design elements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sorayama's dream-come-true watch is powered by caliber BVL 192, a mechanical self-winding caliber found in the Aluminum GMT

                Barcelona striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang suffered a broken jaw during a robbery at his house earlier in the week, sources confirmed to ESPN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aubameyang was assaulted in the early hours of Monday morning when a gang broke into his home equipped with firearms and iron bars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But sources have now confirmed to ESPN that the former Arsenal striker did break his jaw during the break-in and will be out for around three weeks, which could have implications on a proposed move to Chelsea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The injury to Aubameyang's jaw has slightly changed the negotiations, however, with a loan to the west London club emerging as a possible solution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barca coach Xavi Hernandez is happy to keep Aubameyang, but the club's need to reduce their wage bill to fund other business before the transfer window closes this week has forced them to listen to offers

                MANCHESTER UNITED'S capture of Antony will be of keen interest to one Premier League star in particular - Liverpool's Darwin Nunez

                This will also apply for the iPhone boxes Apple leaker also says stocks “…are going well, so I’m assuming there will be little to no shipping delay when ordering it [the Apple Watch Series 8].” For those expecting changes on the box, it will be the same as the Apple Watch Series 7, meaning it will feature a band and a USB-C to MagSafe cable to charge the Apple Watch

            <p>
                Although Shrimp doesn’t talk about that, one of the main features of this upcoming Watch is a new body-temperature sensor, which will also be available with the rumored Apple Watch Pro

                @ChanceHMiller While there is quite a bit we already know about the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro, new details are emerging as we approach Apple’s September 7 event

            <p>
                With that in mind, it seems the only change for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max will be the addition of the new purple color

            <p>
                For the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, the source says that we can expect the same graphite, silver, and gold color options as the iPhone 13 Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking of that MagSafe Battery Pack, Apple is also reportedly planning a new MagSafe battery accessory that will be “exclusive” to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro; more details on this are unclear as of now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In terms of storage, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will both still start with 128GB of storage according to this leak

            <p>
                The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max will use the same A15 chip as the iPhone 13, as previously reported by 9to5Mac.

                As outlined in a new blog post, one of those events, the Mists of Cyrangar, will see players taking on "unspeakable horrors" that "lie shrouded in the mist."

                Dell is proactively reaching out to customers who may be impacted to replace the screen, ideally before it becomes loose

                8BitDo’s older controllers like the SN30 Pro and Pro 2 have boasted a broad array of compatibility options thanks to their Bluetooth connectivity, but the Ultimate Controller will be available in three different configurations — Bluetooth ($69.99), 2.4Ghz ($49.99), or wired ($34.99) — based on your preferred console and connectivity method.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Ultimate Controller will offer a suite of premium features you’d typically find on a controller that costs twice as much
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides being offered in black, white, and pink colorways, the wireless models of the Ultimate Controller come packaged with their own charging dock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps the coolest new feature coming with the new Ultimate controller, however, is 8BitDo’s new controller software suite, which will allow you to remap and tune your controls on PC, Android, and iOS devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You’ll be able to save your preferences to up to three separate profiles, stored independently on the controller's hardware

            <p>
                We’re still waiting to get our hands on this controller, but based on its features, the Ultimate Controller seems poised to serve as a more capable alternative to the official Switch Pro controller and a worthy successor to the 8BitDo Pro 2

                One of our few complaints is the controller’s symmetrical side-by-side joystick layout, which 8BitDo is finally addressing with a new version of its Xbox Ultimate wired controller that also finally goes wireless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That makes its use of side-by-side analog joysticks a bit confusing, because Nintendo has been using an asymmetrical joystick layout since the GameCube WaveBird, and continues to use it on its Joy-Cons and Pro Controller
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sure, the Wii U Pro Controller uses a symmetrical layout, but the stick placement on the 8BitDo Pro 2 is more like a Dualshock’s than that controller’s

                It’s now simply called the 8BitDo Ultimate Controller, and will be available in three versions that cater to pretty much everything except, ironically, the Xbox (and Playstation)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It offers all the same features and functionality of 8BitDo’s wired Xbox controller and the wireless Pro 2, including compatibility with special software and apps for configuring the controller, the ability to store and easily switch between three different configuration profiles, and an extra pair of re-mappable paddle buttons on the back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They won’t replace the wireless 8BitDo Pro 2 controller, however, as that controller’s side-by-side joystick layout will still appeal to some gamers.

                It offers all the same features and functionality of 8BitDo’s wired Xbox controller and the wireless Pro 2, including compatibility with special software and apps for configuring the controller, the ability to store and easily switch between three different configuration profiles, and an extra pair of re-mappable paddle buttons on the back

                They won’t replace the wireless 8BitDo Pro 2 controller, however, as that controller’s side-by-side joystick layout will still appeal to some gamers.

                You can use two apps in split-screen view, or drag a third app onto the display to use three apps at the same time.  Even with the Fold 4's large display, three apps on the screen do get a bit cramped

                The 20-year-old, who was a £4.5m signing from Independiente in February 2021, has caught plenty of attention after impressing under Graham Potter this season

            <p>
                Caicedo has been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, but Potter is confident he will remain on the south coast beyond Thursday's transfer deadline and insisted any potential suitors will need to break the bank to sign the midfielder.  Brighton boss Graham Potter (right) insists any potential suitors for Moises Caicedo (left) will need to break the bank to sign him this window Reports of a £42m bid for Caicedo was relayed back to Potter in his Monday press conference and was asked if it would be enough to part ways with the midfielder

                'As soon as you do research on him you realise he is a top kid, great person, young, playing in the Premier League, has all the attributes to play at the very, very highest level.' Caicedo's value has soared since joining the Seagulls for £4.5m from Ecuadorian side Independiente del Valle in February 2021

                That is how it is, but we are quite calm and confident.'   Saturday's 1-0 win against Leeds at the Amex Stadium lifted them level to 10 points with second-placed Manchester City and Tottenham, but Potter is paying little attention to their lofty position

                Spray cans at the ready The Pokemon Company is teasing something new for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and fans think they've already figured out what is might be.  Yesterday on August 29, the official Pokemon Twitter account tweeted out the strange set of images just below
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As you can see below, one eagle-eyed Twitter user, thinks that a trainer who appeared in a previous trailer for Scarlet and Violet will use this new Pokemon - whatever it ends up being - due to the person holding a spray can
            </p>
            
            <p>
                it seems likely that this trainer used the aiai pokemon as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That typing doesn't currently exist in Pokemon, which would make the new arrival an interesting specimen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Again, it's worth remembering Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are intentionally based in a region styled off Spain, so this theory that the new artwork represents Ibarrola's Oma Forest exhibition is very likely

                Thanks to Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik, Rexy has finally achieved that goal in Tokyo two days ago and has immediately challenged himself for the next task – to produce an Olympic Games champion next

                “As a men’s doubles coach, this is the first time that I have produced a world champion and it has been very satisfying,” said Rexy

            <p>
                “As a coach, I need to set new challenges and the next is obviously to create the Olympics champions for Malaysia in 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rexy is relieved that he is able to become a top coach after many disappointments in his continuous search for a world champion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His next stop was in Thailand in 2017 where he had a successful stint

                Thanks to Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik, Rexy has finally achieved that goal in Tokyo two days ago and has immediately challenged himself for the next task – to produce an Olympic Games champion next
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He will have the next two years to achieve that at the 2024 Paris Olympics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As a men’s doubles coach, this is the first time that I have produced a world champion and it has been very satisfying,” said Rexy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As a coach, I need to set new challenges and the next is obviously to create the Olympics champions for Malaysia in 2024
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rexy is relieved that he is able to become a top coach after many disappointments in his continuous search for a world champion
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His next stop was in Thailand in 2017 where he had a successful stint

                The foldable from Google has been named the Pixel Notepad although, leaks and rumours have referred to it as the Pixel Fold

            <p>
                According to the patent, the flexible screen’s bezel will have a camera with a moving aperture, which, may be the first of its kind in a foldable device.  On August 5, a leak surfaced which disclosed that the Google Pixel folding screen projector will resemble the OPPO Find N from the front and the Google Pixel 7 from the rear.  The device will be relatively compact with a huge screen that folds inward horizontally and will have a complete screen without holes on the inner screen, along with a micro-perforated camera on the inner screen bezel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The outer screen will have a single hole in the middle.  As per previous leaks, the Google Pixel Notepad foldable is supposed to have a short and broad body and a 5.8-inch external screen

                The Pixel Notepad was reportedly going to have a 7.58-inch main display which would be manufactured by Samsung Display

            <p>
                Although this would make the Pixel Fold substantially more expensive than the cheapest Pixel 6, as well as Pixel 7, it would still be about $400 cheaper than the cheapest Galaxy Z Fold 3 & the Galaxy Z Flip 3

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kanto Redrawn also recreated Johto as well, albeit their Johto version isn’t quite as filled with callbacks and details as their Kanto Redrawn.

                It was reported last Thursday (Aug 25) that five people, including a 14-year-old girl, were detained to assist investigations into the kidnapping of a nine-month-old baby girl, at an apartment in Bukit Tengah here last Tuesday (Aug 23)
            </p>

            <p>
                Based on the initial investigations, the teen girl, who came from a broken family, had taken the baby girl from her 65-year-old grandmother, who worked as a nanny
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When the baby's 24-year-old mother went to pick up her daughter about 5.30pm last Tuesday (Aug 23), she was told by the nanny that the baby was taken by the teen girl when she was performing prayers
            </p>

                The Chinese maker BOE is on the other end - it is capable of manufacturing in great volumes but Apple has limited the purchases to the iPhone 14 series, with no Pro in sight

                Samsung’s share is similar to what it was in the iPhone 13 series when it provided 83% of all panels

            <p>
                Detailed info from Young, shipments from display factories to assembling plants were 1.8 million in June, 5.35 million in July, over 10 million in August and over 16.5 million in September

                The Far Out event is happening in Cupertino on September 7 when we expect four phones - iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Max, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max

                The pay per use rate is much more reasonable as users are charged exactly for how much they use by the minute

                If a traveller makes or receives a short voice call daily (less than 60 seconds) for ten days in Singapore, Maxis Postpaid users would have to pay RM150 (RM15 x 10 days) for the mandatory Call and SMS unlimited pass

            <p>
                For example, if a user makes or receives less than 8 minutes of calls, they should be charged the normal rate per minute

            <p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 30 — DAP secretary-general Anthony Loke has called on Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to make decisions as Malaysia's number one leader, instead of his capacity as Umno's vice president
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Seremban MP said that Ismail Sabri should take advantage of the opportunities available to him from the unique political situation Malaysia has been in over the past year to implement more reforms to strengthen the country's democratic system in the remainder of his term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri dares to fight the tide and fend off all internal political pressures, he will be able to implement reforms that have long-term positive implications for our country and society," he said in a statement this morning
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri has been under enormous pressure by his party, Umno — where he is a vice president — to call for an early general election (GE15)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Umno President Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid was seen riling up Umno delegates at the recent Umno Special General Assembly on August 27 to implore Ismail Sabri to give in to party whims, amid massive booing from the crowd when the former mentioned the latter's name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ismail Sabri recently conceded that he is in a dilemma over whether GE15 should be held this year or in 2023, in addition to ensuring a win for his party Umno and the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition

                Ahmad Zahid today also explained that Exim Bank — which had provided a loan to Ri-Yaz — had later suggested that Yayasan Akalbudi withdraw its RM8.6 million investment in the company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When it was suggested that the Ri-Yaz share purchase was meant to be an investment by Yayasan Akalbudi and that Nurulhidayah was placed as a Ri-Yaz director to monitor Yayasan Akalbudi’s investment in the company, Shaheen told the court that he did not know about these
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the 12 criminal breach of trust charges involves Ahmad Zahid allegedly having transferred Yayasan Akalbudi’s RM17.9 million to Lewis & Co
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution had previously suggested that the actual purpose for the RM17.9 million transfer to Lewis & Co was to facilitate the share purchase deal, having highlighted that the RM17.9 million transfer was on June 28, 2016, while the law firm had issued the RM8.6 million cheque to the hotel company on June 30, 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution had also questioned how the RM8.6 million share purchase deal in the hotel firm would fit in with Yayasan Akalbudi’s stated aim of eradicating poverty and enhancing the welfare of the poor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid’s lead defence lawyer Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik had previously argued that the RM8.6 million hotel share purchase deal was not related to the criminal breach of trust charge involving the RM17.9 million sum, as the charge did not mention the deal

                The pass could entice more global firms to situate their headquarters in Singapore, said EuroCham president Federico Donate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Now these individuals can be top consultants, filling the needs of multiple companies that need this expertise," said Dr Lei, noting that this would help companies manage their budgets as they need pay for talent only for the duration of the project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Over time, the enhancements will also help raise the capabilities and skill levels of Singaporeans, and support Singapore’s economic growth.” Federico Donato, president of the European Chamber of Commerce (Singapore), said the new pass could help attract talent in fields such as digital technology and sustainability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pass could also entice more global firms to situate their headquarters – which would need to be mostly staffed by Singaporeans – in Singapore, as their top management could qualify for the new pass, he noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) said in a statement that the ability of those holding the new pass to bring their spouses and dependants, who may have to give up their careers at home, to Singapore is an important consideration for relocation

                The pass could entice more global firms to situate their headquarters in Singapore, said EuroCham president Federico Donate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Now these individuals can be top consultants, filling the needs of multiple companies that need this expertise," said Dr Lei, noting that this would help companies manage their budgets as they need pay for talent only for the duration of the project
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Over time, the enhancements will also help raise the capabilities and skill levels of Singaporeans, and support Singapore’s economic growth.” Federico Donato, president of the European Chamber of Commerce (Singapore), said the new pass could help attract talent in fields such as digital technology and sustainability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pass could also entice more global firms to situate their headquarters – which would need to be mostly staffed by Singaporeans – in Singapore, as their top management could qualify for the new pass, he noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) said in a statement that the ability of those holding the new pass to bring their spouses and dependants, who may have to give up their careers at home, to Singapore is an important consideration for relocation

            <p>
                It's one of the best protective cases for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4

                Also, the top microphone may get partially covered if you use a Z Flip 3 case with a Z Flip 4

                Most but not all the cases on this list allow you to wirelessly charge the Z Flip 4 with the case on

                AMD announced its X670E, X670, and B650 chipsets during the AMD Keynote at Computex 2022, and this evening, AMD has announced a fourth chipset for Ryzen 7000, the B650E chipset
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The B650E chipset will run alongside the already announced B650 chipset, but as it's part of AMD's 'Extreme' series of chipsets, it will benefit from PCIe 5.0 lanes to at least one M.2 slot, as well as optional support for PCIe 5.0 to a PCIe graphics slot, features not available with standard B650 boards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During AMD's Keynote at Computex 2022, AMD's CEO Lisa Su unveiled three AM5 chipsets designed to harness the power of its 5 nm Zen 4 cores within the Ryzen 7000 processors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD's latest announcement of the B650E (Extreme) chipset gives motherboard vendors and users the option of a lower-cost platform but without sacrificing the longevity and expansion support of PCIe 5.0
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This ultimately means that AMD will have a mainstream platform that has PCIe 5.0 by default (B650E) and a lower-cost alternative with just PCIe 4.0 lanes to the PEG and M.2 slots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                AMD is strongly prodding motherboard vendors to offer at least one PCIe 5.0 M.2 slot for storage on most of their boards, as this is one of the main benefits of AMD's AM5 platform

            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s unclear what Microsoft is planning to do regarding the Surface Pro X chassis, which is slightly thinner than the main Surface Pro line

                The Apple Watch also tends to receive an upgrade at the same time as the iPhone 14 – although changes to Apple's wearable are often a little more incremental

            <p>
                But while the Apple Watch Series 8 (opens in new tab) is expected to borrow the same design (again!), rumours of a brand new Watch model are a little more intriguing

                The so-called Apple Watch Pro is said to be offering the first redesign since the Apple Watch Series 4 (when things got a tiny bit rounder and thinner)

                According to The Athletic, Pulisic will stay at Stamford Bridge this season despite interest from Manchester United and Newcastle United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite Chelsea's issues in attack, the young American has only played 76 minutes during the first four matches of the season and expressed interest to move somewhere where he could play consistently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He has two years remaining on his Chelsea contract but after ending last season on a strong note with a goal and an assist in his last three Premier League matches, Pulisic has been left out in the cold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pulisic can flit in and out of games, but he is a player who can bring the spark that Chelsea need even if it's being a more consistent presence off the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Twelve minutes here and five minutes there isn't a way for a player to become familiar with a role.  With so many games, Chelsea will have to dip into their depth eventually and play Pulisic

                As per its presentation, AMD’s new Ryzen 7000 series will be shipping out globally, with the initial lineup comprising no less than four SKUs at launch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That list, which also serves of confirmation of their existence, includes the Ryzen 5 7600X, Ryzen 7 7700X, Ryzen 9 7900X, and Ryzen 9 7950X
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Moving up the ladder, the Ryzen 7 7700X is the 8-cores, 16-threads CPU with a boost clock of 5.4GHz, while the Ryzen 9 7900X is the 12-cores, 24-threads model of the four and a 5.6GHz boost clock
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One thing to note is that the core and thread counts for these Ryzen 7000 series SKUs are identical to the previous generation Ryzen 5000 series, denoting that AMD clearly isn’t straying far from its naming and modeling template and, to state the obvious, merely improved on its performance and delivery, and on per-watt basis overall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On that note, AMD says that its Ryzen 7000 Series boasts a 13% Core IPC uplift over the previous generation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For that matter, we’re also looking at new X-Series and B-Series motherboards, all of which support overclocking

                The iPhone 14 Pro is likely to get get the new A16 Bionic chip, while rumors indicate the base iPhone 14 model could stick with the A15 chip.  The tech giant could also be giving the cameras in its Pro models a big boost for the first time

            <p>
                But the real question is whether the Fold 4 can pass the test of time

            <p>
                The release of the first Galaxy Z Fold in 2019 was notably delayed due to a faulty screen, and Samsung has obviously come a long way since then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While Samsung advertises its Z Fold 4 as “unbelievable tech built to last,” it describes its Z Flip 4 as having “serious durability [that] lets you flex and flip to your heart’s content” and lasts you 200,000 folds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without the plan (and if you’re not covered under warranty), you could wind up paying $499 to replace the Z Fold 4’s inner screen or $357 to repair it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Z Flip 4 is slightly less expensive, costing $349 for an inner screen replacement and $219 for a repair
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First and second-gen Flip and Fold devices (assuming you still have one that hasn’t needed a replacement yet) are eligible for cheaper one-time screen replacements that start at $119, however.

                The omission of a microSD card slot isn’t exactly a surprise, as most phone brands have abandoned that slot, citing technical reasons such as lack of a uniform standard in the SD card slot space, or that a faulty memory card could actually drastically impact the phone’s performance

            <p>
                If you don’t want to pay the markup, there are more affordable options to get more storage in your phone, you just have to accept the hassle of needing to use a secondary gadget

                Indeed, the OnePlus 10T sadly does not have a microSD card slot, so you will have to make do with the 128GB or 256GB storage that you get
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Make sure you choose wisely
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The omission of a microSD card slot isn’t exactly a surprise, as most phone brands have abandoned that slot, citing technical reasons such as lack of a uniform standard in the SD card slot space, or that a faulty memory card could actually drastically impact the phone’s performance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you don’t want to pay the markup, there are more affordable options to get more storage in your phone, you just have to accept the hassle of needing to use a secondary gadget
            </p>

                Yoodo has become the latest local telco company to offer Voice Over WiFi (VoWiFi) service in Malaysia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Allowing for better calls over any WiFi network, regardless of mobile coverage, VoWiFi allows users to make calls indoors through WiFi connection, hence the quality would be much better, especially if your mobile coverage indoors is not up to par
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Yoodo’s official website, the service is available for devices that have VoWiFi or WiFi calling supported by the network
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, only a handful of devices support Yoodo’s VoWiFi service, all of them being Android smartphones, with iOS devices yet to be supported by the network.   Among the smartphones supported include those from Xiaomi, vivo, Samsung, Nokia, HUAWEI and HONOR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Digi, Maxis and Celcom have already enabled the service for their users.  In fact, Yoodo’s introduction of VoWiFi should come as no surprise given its relationship with Celcom, which recently introduced the service back in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In case you didn’t know, Yoodo is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that runs on the Celcom network, hence they both share almost the same features.  So, what do you guys think of the VoWiFi services in Malaysia currently?

                For now, only a handful of devices support Yoodo’s VoWiFi service, all of them being Android smartphones, with iOS devices yet to be supported by the network.   Among the smartphones supported include those from Xiaomi, vivo, Samsung, Nokia, HUAWEI and HONOR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, Digi, Maxis and Celcom have already enabled the service for their users.  In fact, Yoodo’s introduction of VoWiFi should come as no surprise given its relationship with Celcom, which recently introduced the service back in June
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In case you didn’t know, Yoodo is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that runs on the Celcom network, hence they both share almost the same features.  So, what do you guys think of the VoWiFi services in Malaysia currently?

                In a strongly-worded statement to defend the judiciary which came under attack after Najib was found guilty in the SRC case, the eight former presidents of the Malaysian Bar criticised the potential criminal act by those who had made false allegations against the SRC trial judge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The eight former presidents said the false allegation of bribery against Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali — the judge who had heard and decided on Najib’s SRC case — was “outrageous and spurious”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They suggested the attack on the judge could be a crime, pointing out that the bribery claims were false and actually attacked the entire judiciary

            <p>
                Not only is this a baseless assault on the learned Judge, but it is an assault on the whole Judiciary,” they said in a seven-page statement

            <p>
                Noting that the current attorney general Idrus was himself a former Federal Court judge, they said he must especially appreciate the ramifications or the consequences of such assaults on the judiciary

                The $199.99 HP 965 4K Streaming webcam is the company’s new business-oriented model that contains a Sony Starvis CMOS sensor, similar in spec (and price) to Dell’s 4K webcam offering, Elgato’s Facecam, and Razer’s Kiyo Pro

                Assuming you actually like the effect and you opted for HP’s new monitor with IPS Black, for example, over the Z24m with an integrated webcam and similar tech, it’s another way to get it set up on your desk or in your office
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are also dual microphones, similar to Dell’s 2K webcam, that provide better noise reduction and clarity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The webcam can be mounted on your monitor, tripod, or stand on any surface
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also has a 360-degree swivel, and it’s got a top hinge that can rotate the camera 90 degrees downward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During presentations, it can apply a keystone correction effect when presenting documents on camera

                The $199.99 HP 965 4K Streaming webcam is the company’s new business-oriented model that contains a Sony Starvis CMOS sensor, similar in spec (and price) to Dell’s 4K webcam offering, Elgato’s Facecam, and Razer’s Kiyo Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Assuming you actually like the effect and you opted for HP’s new monitor with IPS Black, for example, over the Z24m with an integrated webcam and similar tech, it’s another way to get it set up on your desk or in your office
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are also dual microphones, similar to Dell’s 2K webcam, that provide better noise reduction and clarity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The webcam can be mounted on your monitor, tripod, or stand on any surface
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also has a 360-degree swivel, and it’s got a top hinge that can rotate the camera 90 degrees downward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During presentations, it can apply a keystone correction effect when presenting documents on camera

                Liverpool have been advised to make a move for Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves by former Manchester United player Luke Chadwick

            <p>
                Before Liverpool’s clash with Bournemouth on Saturday, however, the German tactician admitted that he is now interested in signing a new midfielder before the closure of the transfer window on September 1

            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Neves having age on his side but also being an experienced Premier League player, he does certainly fit Liverpool’s transfer criteria and it will be interesting to see if we confirm our interest in the former FC Porto star
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Jude Bellingham expected to make the switch to Merseyside next season, we’ll just have to wait and see how much money the club are willing to splash on a midfielder this summer

                Apple's new iPhone 14 line is expected to have its big reveal at the company's "Far Out" event on Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is where the 2022 iPhone series is expected to launch, and rumors further point to the iPhone 14 getting a Sept

            <p>
                After introducing the notch on the iPhone X back in 2017, Apple could finally ditch it this year -- though apparently only on the Pro models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead of lighting up your entire display like your lock screen does, an always-on display only activates a portion of the screen to save power.   Apple didn't make any price changes between the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineup, but Wedbush analyst Dan Ives expects a price hike for iPhone 14 pro models to the tune of $100
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, the iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099.   That's backed up by Kuo, who recently said he expects the average selling price of the iPhone 14 lineup to increase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple's last two iPhone lineups have featured the same 6.1-inch size for the base model, going up to 6.7 inches for the Pro Max

                Apple's new iPhone 14 line is expected to have its big reveal at the company's "Far Out" event on Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is where the 2022 iPhone series is expected to launch, and rumors further point to the iPhone 14 getting a Sept

            <p>
                Instead of lighting up your entire display like your lock screen does, an always-on display only activates a portion of the screen to save power.   Apple didn't make any price changes between the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineup, but Wedbush analyst Dan Ives expects a price hike for iPhone 14 pro models to the tune of $100
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, the iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099.   That's backed up by Kuo, who recently said he expects the average selling price of the iPhone 14 lineup to increase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple's last two iPhone lineups have featured the same 6.1-inch size for the base model, going up to 6.7 inches for the Pro Max

                Adding emojis to Google Docs is about to get easier thanks to a new feature that allows people to search and insert the popular pictograms directly when typing, Google said in a blog post Monday.  Inserting an emoji requires typing the "@" followed by relevant text, such as "smile" or "dog." A dropdown menu will appear, allowing for quick selection.  Here's how Google Docs' new emoji insertion feature works.  Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment

                But Press Start reports that the new models are on shelves in many Australian retailers right now, including manuals listing their official weights at 8.6 lbs (3.9 kg) for the Disc Drive Edition and 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg) for the Digital Edition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The CFI-11XX models—which also hit Australia first in August 2021— came in at 9.25 lbs (4.2 kg) and 7.9 lbs (3.6 kg) for their Disc and Digital Editions, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That effectively splits the weight difference between the launch model and the newest model hitting Australia today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If those trends continue at the same rates, the Disc Drive Edition of the PS5 will weigh exactly zero pounds on August 31, 2034, with the Digital Edition hitting weightlessness on March 20, 2035

                But Press Start reports that the new models are on shelves in many Australian retailers right now, including manuals listing their official weights at 8.6 lbs (3.9 kg) for the Disc Drive Edition and 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg) for the Digital Edition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The CFI-11XX models—which also hit Australia first in August 2021— came in at 9.25 lbs (4.2 kg) and 7.9 lbs (3.6 kg) for their Disc and Digital Editions, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That effectively splits the weight difference between the launch model and the newest model hitting Australia today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If those trends continue at the same rates, the Disc Drive Edition of the PS5 will weigh exactly zero pounds on August 31, 2034, with the Digital Edition hitting weightlessness on March 20, 2035

                According to Kuo, “whether iPhone 14 will offer satellite communication service depends on whether Apple and operators can settle the business model.” Kuo says this hurdle may have already delayed the feature once — according to him, the hardware that would’ve let the iPhone 13 communicate with satellites was finished, but Apple couldn’t figure out the business end with carriers

            <p>
                “There’s no reason from the carrier perspective why this should be a problem unless they have some kind of exclusive deal with SpaceX not to use any other satellite service,” he said

            <p>
                However, during its presentation, T-Mobile said it would have to work with messaging app developers to make their systems compatible with its satellite tech — if Apple wants to use the carrier’s SMS and voice systems in its satellite communications feature, it may be a similar situation

            <p>
                One other question that could hold things up — between the carrier, Apple, the satellite provider, and iPhone users, who ends up paying for satellite messaging, and how? “In the case of T-Mobile and SpaceX, that’s fairly straightforward

                However, during its presentation, T-Mobile said it would have to work with messaging app developers to make their systems compatible with its satellite tech — if Apple wants to use the carrier’s SMS and voice systems in its satellite communications feature, it may be a similar situation

                AMD is expected to launch four CPUs in its Ryzen 7000 series (the “X” line) this evening, and a few hours ahead of the announcement, the pricing has already leaked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 7000 series is the direct successor to the 5000 desktop series — the 6000 series (currently trickling out in certain laptop models) skipped the desktop chips
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Much of what we know about these upcoming Ryzen 7000 CPUs comes from AMD’s Computex keynote earlier this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pricing, if confirmed, would not come as a surprise — the Ryzen 5000 generation was widely considered to be priced high at release, and the new generation brings a significant increase in clock speed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, some PC enthusiasts may see $300 for a six-core part as a bad deal since Intel’s competing Core i5-12400 part has a suggested retail price of under $200, and AMD’s own Ryzen 7 5700X (an eight-core chip from the last generation) can currently be found all over the place for under $300
            </p>

                Numerous Apple-watching outfits have reported that the company is working on a rugged, fitness-minded "Apple Watch Pro," to be announced at its September 7 event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The device could be even more of an upgrade than some expect, as the latest rumor has the wider, more square-shaped "Pro" watch requiring all-new bands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The user embedded an image from Twitter account Apple Hub, which offered a quirky rendering of the rumored Pro design and cited a price "close to $1,000." According to Mac Otakara, the upcoming Apple Watch Series 8 “Pro” will feature a larger 47mm size and a flat display

            <p>
                For those not going on day-long bikepacking or ultra-marathon excursions, the expected Apple Watch 8 and Apple Watch SE are likely to see a spec bump or other minor improvements, such as a body temperature sensor and the same kind of low-power but still app-capable mode as the Pro

                Will Apple host an event in October? What could be announced? We know for certain that Apple is hosting an event on September 7, where the company is widely expected to unveil its next flagship iPhone, the iPhone 14, as well as the Apple Watch Series 8 and possibly other models.  However, Apple is expected to hold a second event later in the year as it has previously, likely an event focused on Mac and iPad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This could mean that Apple is also hoping to hold its second fall event earlier in the month of October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple unveiled the MacBook Pro at its October event on October 18 last year, and its virtual October event for 2020 was held on October 13
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We're also expecting a new Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There could be other supplementary products like Apple's AirPods Pro 2, or even a new HomePod
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An October event is undoubtedly a prime candidate.  More likely, Apple is expected to unveil a new M2-powered version of its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro

                Huawei will unveil the Mate 50 series on September 6 with at least four phones expected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There may be a surprise appearance as the Chinese wireless authority posted images of a foldable phone that appears to be the successor to the Huawei P50 Pocket (which was unveiled in December of last year)

                The device, known only by its ‘BAL-AL80’ model number for now, is only the second clamshell foldable from Huawei, which prefers the larger horizontal foldable design

            <p>
                Second generation Huawei clamshell foldable (‘BAL-AL80’) The images show a two-tone design – seemingly glass and leather – and show a triple camera

                This is because we were not aware of its existence in Malaysia until we stumbled upon the desktop machine alongside both gaming laptops at Thunder Match Technology’s HP booth during last weekend’s Malaysia IT Fair

                A handwritten note by Nissan Z chief product specialist Hiroshi Tamura sighted by Car Expert offered reasons for the 370Z no longer selling as well as the carmaker had hoped, as well as setting out targets for what its successor, the latest Nissan Z, should achieve
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 370Z’s lack of sales success was attributed to its exterior design, performance, and the lack of updates, according to Tamura’s handwritten note, Car Expert reported
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, the targets set for the new Z was to have an all-new exterior, a partial interior update and an engine output of around 400 hp, which was considered only doable with a twin-turbo engine, according to the note
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, Tamura believes that Nissan’s approval for the Z to go on sale was due to the new car’s relative affordability for both the carmaker and for the customers by being able to produce a car that could meet performance expectations with the existing twin-turbo engine already developed for Infiniti, and on a platform already used to build the 370Z

                Got no money to develop new car so recycle parts from old cars, recycle design from old car

            <p>
                Under Ghosn, 350Z was new, GTR was new, 370Z was new, so this is karma biting Jap arses for being ungrateful

                The CFI-1200, a lighter PS5 model, is reportedly on sale in Australia There's a newer, lighter PS5 on sale in Australia, according to Press Start (opens in new tab)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Australian site reports that the CFI-1200 model, first listed by Japanese retailers, is currently available for purchase in stores.  Both disc and disc-less PS5 models are lighter than their original counterparts, with the new digital PS5 weighing a little over 5lbs and the new disc version weighing about 8.5lbs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That means that the new model of the PS5 weighs about a pound and a half less than the original (which was just shy of 10lbs) and less than the digital PS5 did at launch (which weighed about 8.6lbs).  While it's not clear what Sony has done to make the new versions of the PS5 lighter, it's likely something to do with what's going on under the hood
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Canada, the standard PS5 is now CAD $649.99 while the digital is CAD $519.99, in Australia, it's AUD $799.95 and AUD $649.95 respectively

                The CFI-1200, a lighter PS5 model, is reportedly on sale in Australia There's a newer, lighter PS5 on sale in Australia, according to Press Start (opens in new tab)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Australian site reports that the CFI-1200 model, first listed by Japanese retailers, is currently available for purchase in stores.  Both disc and disc-less PS5 models are lighter than their original counterparts, with the new digital PS5 weighing a little over 5lbs and the new disc version weighing about 8.5lbs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That means that the new model of the PS5 weighs about a pound and a half less than the original (which was just shy of 10lbs) and less than the digital PS5 did at launch (which weighed about 8.6lbs).  While it's not clear what Sony has done to make the new versions of the PS5 lighter, it's likely something to do with what's going on under the hood
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Canada, the standard PS5 is now CAD $649.99 while the digital is CAD $519.99, in Australia, it's AUD $799.95 and AUD $649.95 respectively

            <p>
                Samsung’s first device to run software based on Android 12L is the new Galaxy Z Fold4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, the tablet-centric version of Android is coming to Samsung’s tablets too, starting with the Tab S8 series

            <p>
                The Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 series is getting updated to Android 12L What’s new? The taskbar feature lets you quickly switch between and launch apps (including app pairs in split-screen mode), without having to use DeX mode
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also, a two-finger gesture can be used to flip between full-screen and split-screen modes
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Another leakster, Kioriku, reports that the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max will only charge at 30W near 0% and before dropping down to 27-25W (that’s how a typical charge curve works)

                Snapchat is bringing its “Dual Camera” feature front and center on the app’s main camera toolbar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you click that icon, you’ll be given four dual camera options

                Snapchat’s timing in rolling out this feature doesn’t seem entirely coincidental

            <p>
                Instagram just brought its own two-camera feature (also called dual) to the toolbar screen on Reels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Snapchat’s dual camera does actually offer a different experience, though

            <p>
                Instagram’s latest feature test is about being BeReal  Instagram’s Dual camera feature copies BeReal, but misses the point

            <p>
                The feature appears as an icon in the main camera menu that looks like two cameras on top of each other
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instagram also introduced a dual camera mode earlier this year, but Snapchat's dual camera works with all its AR lenses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Snapchat, the dual camera feature was originally intended for Snap's Creator Cam in Director Mode, but the feature's expanded to the main Snapchat app..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The AR elements of Snapchat's dual camera feature look the most intriguing and transformative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the moment, the dual camera mode runs on iOS, needing an iPhone XS or later to work
            </p>

                According to Wccftech, the pricing of Ryzen 7000 series has now been leaked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The flagship 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X CPU is said to cost 799 USD, the same price as Ryzen 9 5950X at launch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In fact, even the 12-core Ryzen 9 7900X should cost 549 USD, which is again the same MSRP as 5900X with Zen3 architecture
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 8-core Zen4 CPU called Ryzen 7 7700X will cost 449 USD, same MSRP as 5800X and 5800X3D at launch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no 7800X SKU for now, but it may appear later with 3D V-Cache. Finally, the 6-core Ryzen 5 7600X would cost 299 USD, which was the initial MSRP for 6-core Ryzen 5 5600X and later 8-core Ryzen 7 5700X
            </p>

                Destiny 2 While this bug has been going on since the launch of Destiny 2’s Season of Plunder, I didn’t really experience it in full until I ran the King’s Fall raid last night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You may notice it a bit in normal seasonal content like Expeditions or Ketchcrash, but it is really noticeable when you do harder content like the raid or stuff at a higher power level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I was trying to run arc 3.0 Warlock last night during the raid, and I barely dragged myself through Totems

            <p>
                Destiny 2 The bug seems to go above and beyond just turning Resilience off, as I feel like it almost makes you take more damage than you would have before Resilience was changed to a damage-reducing stat

                Destiny 2 While this bug has been going on since the launch of Destiny 2’s Season of Plunder, I didn’t really experience it in full until I ran the King’s Fall raid last night

            <p>
                You may notice it a bit in normal seasonal content like Expeditions or Ketchcrash, but it is really noticeable when you do harder content like the raid or stuff at a higher power level

            <p>
                Next to her are Lee Jae Min, Seoyeon High School’s most popular student who always puts on a smiling face, followed by Yoon Bo Mi, the school queen who is kind and pretty, and Choi Jin Young, who looks tough on the outside but is unexpectedly kind

                Sony's gaming chief Jim Ryan in May outlined plans to radically broaden the games portfolio beyond the PlayStation 5 console and the group's focus on single player games with more releases on PC and mobile

            <p>
                Savage Game Studios, which was established two years ago and is working on a live service action title for mobile, will become part of a new mobile division of PlayStation Studios, Sony said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>

                According to Kopite7kimi, NVIDIA is now considering two possible specifications for its RTX 4070 graphics card.   One step forward, one step back
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Initial rumors claimed RTX 4070 will launch with 10 GB and 160-bit GDDR6 memory configuration, later to be ‘updated’ to 12GB and 192-bit spec
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, this card would have limited memory size to 10 GB and as a result narrower bus width to 160-bit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kopite earlier claimed that the total board power is 300W, but now it is said to be 285W or 250W depending on the SKU
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Total board power is not the same spec as TDP though, but it should still be higher than RTX 3070 non-Ti
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The RTX 4070 is expected to make a debut in October alongside RTX 4090 and RTX 4080

                AMD will be unveiling the Zen 4 Raphael Ryzen 7000 mainstream desktop processors later today

                Raw performance gains aside, AMD might just have another trick up its sleeve to best Intel's upcoming Raptor Lake generation.

            <p>
                Weibo user "Venom Warlock Marvin" has indicated that the 16-core 32-thread Ryzen 9 7950X might be able to boost up to an F-max of 5.85 GHz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether such a modification will be possible or not with Ryzen 7000 can be gleaned only when we get to know some of the architecture and other deep-dive details.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We also get to know that the two CCDs on the Ryzen 9 7950X are called Durango while the individual cores are named Persephone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Ryzen 9 7950X will fight it out with the Core i9-13900K, which is pegged to boost up to 5.8 GHz, in a battle for the maximum clocks.

                AMD will be unveiling the Zen 4 Raphael Ryzen 7000 mainstream desktop processors later today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Raw performance gains aside, AMD might just have another trick up its sleeve to best Intel's upcoming Raptor Lake generation.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weibo user "Venom Warlock Marvin" has indicated that the 16-core 32-thread Ryzen 9 7950X might be able to boost up to an F-max of 5.85 GHz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether such a modification will be possible or not with Ryzen 7000 can be gleaned only when we get to know some of the architecture and other deep-dive details.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We also get to know that the two CCDs on the Ryzen 9 7950X are called Durango while the individual cores are named Persephone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Ryzen 9 7950X will fight it out with the Core i9-13900K, which is pegged to boost up to 5.8 GHz, in a battle for the maximum clocks.

                Samsung has just unveiled a new virtual avatar, a weird-looking cartoon bug called G-NUSMAS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Borrowing an idea from Internet meme, which shows customers’ affectionate interest in Samsung Electronics, a friendly and pleasant avatar has come out into the world… By letting our whimsical and brilliant alien show different sides of Samsung to the public, I hope our consumers can feel more familiar with our brand,” said YH Lee, the Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Global Marketing at Samsung Electronics
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And if you haven’t figure it out by now, G-NUSMAS is also SAMSUNG backwards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for what Samsung plans to do with this virtual avatar, they said that they will be releasing a series of short-form videos about the story of G∙NUSMAS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The series will start from birth and accidental arrival on Earth, to its journey as it works, plays, and has “a variety of experiences” at Samsung’s headquarters.  “G∙NUSMAS’ bright and cheerful personality will shine through the videos as it sings, dances and interacts with a variety of Samsung devices, from jumping around on a monitor to dancing on the screen of a smartphone,” continued Samsung
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even though I think Sam, a leaked mascot for Samsung, would have been a more popular character, I can see why Samsung was a bit unsure to launch her

                The series will start from birth and accidental arrival on Earth, to its journey as it works, plays, and has “a variety of experiences” at Samsung’s headquarters.  “G∙NUSMAS’ bright and cheerful personality will shine through the videos as it sings, dances and interacts with a variety of Samsung devices, from jumping around on a monitor to dancing on the screen of a smartphone,” continued Samsung

                If you often forget to mute yourself back after chiming in during a Google Meet call, the search giant is introducing a handy shortcut to its video conferencing service to address this issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google has announced in a blog post (opens in new tab) that it will roll out the ability to unmute yourself in a Google Meet conference by just holding down the space bar

                The update comes at a time when Google's merger of Meet and Duo is still perplexing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google changed Duo's icon and name a few weeks ago to reflect Meet's takeover
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google is now bringing back the Duo icon, which, when tapped, takes you to Meet

                If you often forget to mute yourself back after chiming in during a Google Meet call, the search giant is introducing a handy shortcut to its video conferencing service to address this issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google has announced in a blog post (opens in new tab) that it will roll out the ability to unmute yourself in a Google Meet conference by just holding down the space bar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nonetheless, it's an excellent addition to Meet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The update comes at a time when Google's merger of Meet and Duo is still perplexing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google changed Duo's icon and name a few weeks ago to reflect Meet's takeover
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Google is now bringing back the Duo icon, which, when tapped, takes you to Meet
            </p>

                On June 21, this year, the Shah Alam High Court acquitted and discharged Samirah, 47, who is Nazrin's widow and the two teenagers aged 19 and 16 after finding that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against the trio

            <p>
                In his decision, the judge ruled that the evidence that Samirah and the teenagers were the last persons with the Nazrin, cannot be said to lead to his murder

            <p>
                On June 23, the Attorney General's Chambers filed its notice of appeal against the High Court's decision to acquit Samirah and the teenagers from the murder charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, on June 30, Samirah and the teenagers also filed an appeal to challenge certain of the High Court's findings of facts including the findings that the fire which broke out in Nazrin's room was "done deliberately"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court judge, in his oral judgment, had said the court accepted the testimonies of the Kuala Lumpur Fire and Rescue Department director Edwin Galan Teruki and investigating officer Halim Zulkefeli, in which they concluded that the fire was deliberately lit

                On June 23, the Attorney General's Chambers filed its notice of appeal against the High Court's decision to acquit Samirah and the teenagers from the murder charge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, on June 30, Samirah and the teenagers also filed an appeal to challenge certain of the High Court's findings of facts including the findings that the fire which broke out in Nazrin's room was "done deliberately"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The High Court judge, in his oral judgment, had said the court accepted the testimonies of the Kuala Lumpur Fire and Rescue Department director Edwin Galan Teruki and investigating officer Halim Zulkefeli, in which they concluded that the fire was deliberately lit

                Oris just announced a pretty sweet tool watch as part of Geneva Watch Days, which kicked off today in Switzerland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new release is part of the main Divers Sixty-Five collection, features the company's in-house-designed caliber 400, and has an unexpected bezel format, featuring 12 one-hour markers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Believe it or not, today's release is actually the very first Divers Sixty-Five with the caliber 400 to enter serial production
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Oris Divers Sixty-Five Caliber 400 12H is offered on either a black leather strap or a stainless steel bracelet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In my view, the Divers Sixty-Five is Oris' way of exploring vintage tool watch design, using its own history in the category through the mid-1960s Oris Star collection as a platform
            </p>

                As for me, I think I'll stick with my Divers Sixty-Five Caliber 400 Limited Edition for HODINKEE

                The Chronograph GMT Automatic Earlier this year the good folks at Bulgari released two slightly funky, titanium 'Sketch' Octo Finissimo watches, an Octo Finissimo Automatic and an Octo Finissimo Chronograph GMT, to celebrate 10 years of the Octo line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The GMT Chronograph gets a rose gold makeover while the Automatic gets punched up in either rose or yellow gold.  The Chronograph GMT Automatic is a cool 3.3mm thick (still the slimmest chrono out there, honey) and runs on the automatic BVL Calibre 318, just like the 'Sketch' GMT from March
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 43mm case is satin-brushed rose gold, with a brown lacquered dial, applied rose gold indexes, and a brown alligator strap.  The Automatics in rose and yellow gold, while not entirely new, are new to this version of the OFA, and in the case of the yellow gold, very limited
            </p>
            
            <p>
                James went hands-on with the brushed gold Octo Finissimo Automatic in 2020 and there are a few very subtle changes (the new version of the BVL 138 movement has a new automatic winding system and structure for the escapement and balance, according to Bulgari) as well as a few more obvious updates (the dial is brown now! The bracelet and case are a mix of brushed and polished!).  Yellow gold Octo Finissimo Automatic The yellow gold version of the OFA is an extremely limited American-only LE of 50 pieces to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the first Bulgari boutique in the States
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From the pictures, the combination of the rose gold and brown lacquered dial gives the GMT a pleasantly '70s (almost "Root Beer") vibe and warms up what can be something of a cold watch.  Nothing is more celebratory than decking oneself out in gold and cultivating an air of exclusivity, so I think the yellow gold automatic is about as on-the-nose as you can get for an anniversary watch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rose gold version of the Octo Finissimo Automatic.  I am curious to see how the wrist presence of the watch changes with the precious metal

                A passer-by stumbled upon the 73-year-old woman’s lifeless body lying on the shore and immediately alerted the police at about 6.45am on Monday (Aug 29)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                City police chief OCPD Asst Comm Mohd Zaidi Abdullah said the passer-by spotted the body near a meteorology station at Tanjung Aru Beach 3
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said policemen from the nearby Tanjung Aru police station subsequently rushed to the location after the distress call

            <p>
                He, however, advised witnesses to the incident to get in touch with the police.

                Ahmad Zahid is testifying as the first defence witness in his own defence in the trial

            <p>

                At one point, Zaidi sought to ask Ahmad Zahid to say whether the activities of the private company TS Consultancy & Resources — which received RM360,000 of Ahmad Zahid's charity Yayasan Akalbudi funds — were focused on a specific location

            <p>
                The judge then noted that this means the matter has already been explained previously in cross-examination, but Zaidi said he wanted to "expand" the matter in his re-examination of Ahmad Zahid

Ahmad Zahid's lead defence lawyer Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik then said the defence team should be entitled to expand on the matter and there ought to be no limit since the point was raised by the prosecution during cross-examination, and argued that the question should be admissible to explain the point

                An interesting report from SmartphoneDigest has claimed that the Sony Xperia 5 IV has turned up on Geekbench, which in turn has revealed some of the compact flagship smartphone’s specifications
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the report, the codename Sony XQ-CQ62 pertains to the Sony Xperia 5 IV (apparently the US variant), which makes sense as the XQ-CQ part has been associated with the Xperia 5 range in the past
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There were some hopes for the Plus variant to be planted into the Mark 4 model of the Xperia 5 but these were optimistic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Further evidence of the chip being the regular variant is the 1-core speed of 3.00 GHz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The top clock rate for the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 is 3.2 GHz, and this does have an effect in synthetic benchmark such as Geekbench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, the RAM amount states “6.91 GB”, which signposts to a total of 8 GB of memory for the Sony Xperia 5 IV, which would be the same amount as its predecessor

            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the report, the codename Sony XQ-CQ62 pertains to the Sony Xperia 5 IV (apparently the US variant), which makes sense as the XQ-CQ part has been associated with the Xperia 5 range in the past
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There were some hopes for the Plus variant to be planted into the Mark 4 model of the Xperia 5 but these were optimistic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Further evidence of the chip being the regular variant is the 1-core speed of 3.00 GHz
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The top clock rate for the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 is 3.2 GHz, and this does have an effect in synthetic benchmark such as Geekbench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, the RAM amount states “6.91 GB”, which signposts to a total of 8 GB of memory for the Sony Xperia 5 IV, which would be the same amount as its predecessor
            </p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 29 — Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi today again insisted that he faced politically-motivated prosecution after the Barisan Nasional coalition lost in the 14th general election (GE14) in May 2018

            </p>
            
            <p>
                And there were more than 81 division leaders that were also forced to be hauled to and charged in court who allegedly obtained funds from an organisation under the administration of the former prime minister," he claimed in the High Court today

                Ahmad Zahid then spoke of his trust in the court being just and that justice is a correct legal system, but then suggested that the legal system should not be used to take revenge

            <p>
                “The Sarawak government will continue with the initiative to provide 5 to 25 per cent discount on monthly electricity bills of domestic households and of commercial and industrial users – including food operators and retailers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aside from that, Abang Johari said discount of 25 per cent will be given for assessment rates exceeding RM400 a year and 30 per cent discount for assessment rates below RM400 for residential, commercial, industrial and special holdings from July to December this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This measure will benefit more than 500,000 premises under the local authorities (PBT) and at the same time ease the burden on the people and traders in Sarawak, costing the state government RM54 million, he added

            <p>
                As at June this year, Malaysia’s inflation rate increased by 3.4 per cent compared to the same month last year; while Sarawak’s inflation rate increased by 3.2 per cent compared to the same period last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “As a government that listens and is concerned about the people’s complaints, the Sarawak government has decided to continue providing assistance to ease the burden of the people of Sarawak who are affected by the increase in the cost of living, especially those with low income,” Abang Johari said.

                The well-known tipster Ice universe has been frequently commenting on the Samsung Galaxy S23 series, offering tidbits about specifications and design of the much-anticipated trio of flagship smartphones

            <p>
                As we have previously reported, only small design changes are expected from the Galaxy S22 Ultra to the Galaxy S23 Ultra, and as many people are fans of the terrific aesthetic of the former it’s no wonder Samsung plans more of the same for the latter.

                According to the source, the width of the middle section of the frame of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra will be made larger, and in return this will force the curved display to be a little less curvy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This might be due to practical reasons, as it is rumored that Samsung will pack as much as possible into the Galaxy S23 Ultra, including a new Qualcomm 3D Sonic Max ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor and, hopefully, UFS 4.0 storage

                Now that they’re here, Meta seems to be promoting Reels content over other types
            </p>
            
            <p>
                HypeAuditor analyzed 77.6 million Instagram posts to discover how different types of content flourish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The most popular type of content in July 2022 was the Image post, with 42.2% of posts analyzed being image posts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reels took the third spot, with 22.1% of the content in July 2022 being Reels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instagram is heavily favoring Reels content, which relies on the discovery algorithm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reels prioritizes the discovery of new content by letting an algorithm serve up content from people you don’t follow but that it thinks you might like.

                Zaid, Liew Teck Huat and Rueben Mathiavanam say they will initiate legal action against Cheah if the retraction and apology are not forthcoming by Sept 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They allege that the press release on Aug 19, which formed the basis of news reports appearing in the Edge, Malay Mail and The Star on the same day, “falsely and maliciously” contained statements concerning their conduct in Najib’s appeal in the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Issued on Aug 26 via their law firm, Zaid Ibrahim Suflan TH Liew & Partners, the letter identifies several paragraphs in Cheah’s press statement which the lawyers claim showed a “reckless disregard as to whether the imputations complained of (were) true”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib had on July 25 appointed Zaid’s law firm to replace Shafee & Co as solicitors in his final SRC International criminal appeal before the Federal Court, with Hisyam Teh Poh Teik roped in to be lead counsel in place of Shafee Abdullah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the apex court turned down several requests for additional time to prepare for the appeal, Najib discharged the firm as solicitors as well as Zaid, Liew and Rueben as co-counsel on Aug 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 23, the Federal Court unanimously affirmed Najib’s conviction on all seven charges of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering brought in respect of SRC International funds totalling RM42 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The conviction and sentence were first handed down by the Kuala Lumpur High Court on July 28, 2020 and affirmed by the Court of Appeal on Dec 8 last year

                An Indiana bankruptcy judge last Friday rejected 3M’s bid to temporarily halt the avalanche of lawsuits accusing the manufacturing giant and a bankrupt subsidiary of selling faulty combat earplugs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                3M said it would appeal, but that was little relief for investors, who sent its shares down the most in the S&P 500 Index by last Friday’s close

            <p>
                “The expectation was that 3M’s bankruptcy strategy would be vigorously contested.” 3M announced the surprise move to put its Aearo subsidiary into bankruptcy late last month as it reported second-quarter earnings, and plans to spin off its massive health-care products division

            <p>
                But last Friday’s bankruptcy decision threatens to keep 3M under a cloud of uncertainty, at least until the appeals process runs its course

                The developer of Nanominer has added support recently for Intel's new Arc GPU, where it's been benchmarked with some Ethereum mining..
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ethereum miners are preparing for Proof of Stake in the coming weeks, making Ethereum mining on the Intel Arc A380 kinda useless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's good to see the performance and whatnot of Intel's new GPU, but when the DAG size for Ethereum is 5127MB, then the VRAM on the Intel Arc A380 becomes an issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                this is an issue if the Arc A380 is your primary GPU and is busy (VRAM being consumed) running other things
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If it's dumped into a miner with other Arc GPUs, the 6GB of VRAM won't be an issue..

                Such a feature not only incentivizes players to interact with the game on a daily basis but also rewards them for it, further establishing the habit of booting up the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Genshin Impact is somewhat different in how it deals with claiming daily log-in rewards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, this feature was not implemented until version 1.6 of the game’s release
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here, players can click or tap on their reward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Next, they must log into the game and claim their item via the in-game mailbox
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Genshin Impact is available on PC, Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5

                A well-regarded Marvel's Avengers insider has recently shared good news about the popular superhero game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While this move was previously known to be happening, the deal becoming official led to fans wondering what would now happen to the ongoing support of Marvel's Avengers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Luckily, it doesn't sound like much should be changing in the near future.  According to a Marvel's Avengers leaker that goes by the name Miller, Embracer group is now said to be working out a deal with Marvel Games that will allow Crystal Dynamics to continue supporting the project moving forward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although nothing official is said to be getting announced about this partnership in the near future, Miller shared that those within Crystal Dynamics are continuing to work on Marvel's Avengers "relatively unabated." While he stressed that this could end up changing in the future, it seems like the shift in companies that own Crystal Dynamics hasn't altered how the development team within the studio is operating.  From the outside looking in, it seems like Embracer are in the middle of working out a deal with Marvel that extends well beyond Avengers (which is understandable with recent news suggesting both EA and Ubisoft have Marvel content in the pipeline.) In a general sense, this isn't too shocking to hear given that Crystal Dynamics recently outlined its plans for Marvel's Avengers in the coming months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While it seemed possible that Embracer would shut down these plans, instead, the new parent company seems to be committed to keeping the game alive.  Likely the most interesting part of this new information from Miller is that Embracer may be looking to make a larger deal with those at Marvel which would allow its studios to work on other projects tied to the comic book brand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Clearly, Embracer is now looking to establish a relationship with Marvel that could go beyond the continued support of Avengers.  Are you glad to hear that the development of Marvel's Avengers is seemingly going to continue for the long haul? And how would you like to see the game evolve in the future? Let me know either down in the comments or message me on Twitter at @MooreMan12

            <p>
                While all of the individual pieces themselves might not be a problem, some players are arguing that being bombarded with these screen-blocking notices is a serious problem

            <p>
                This issue came under the microscope when a player shared a video of a notification that blocked their screen just as they got into a crucial gunfight

            <p>
                For the members of the community who can change their Field-of-View, this might not be such a problem, but as one commenter noted, it can be a real game-ruiner for those who are stuck on the default setting

            <p>
                While having a wider area of vision in Warzone can certainly help, there are also other ways that the game keeps players alert to their surroundings, but not all of them are super helpful according to another player

            <p>
                It’s likely too late in Warzone’s lifespan for big changes to be made to the notification system, but with Warzone 2 on the way, there is still hope that Activision will bring more customization to the user experience eventually.

                Three separate filings show trademarks for “Reality One,” “Reality Pro,” and “Reality Processor,” matching the realityOS name that cropped up in Apple’s code and a trademark application that potentially refers to the headset’s operating system

            </p>
            
            <p>
                All three filings mention “virtual and augmented reality headsets, goggles, glasses, and smartglasses.” It’s possible that the “Reality One” trademark refers to the name of the headset itself, while “Reality Pro” indicates a spec-boosted version that Apple has planned down the road, in line with the same “Pro” moniker Apple applies to its higher-end devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the name “Reality Processor” may allude to the headset’s processing unit, which is rumored to be an M2 chip

            <p>
                The applications surfaced just a little over a week before Apple’s “Far Out” event, but it’s unlikely that the mixed reality headset will make an appearance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The headset is rumored to allow for both augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences and games, including VR versions of Apple Maps and FaceTime, and potentially even experiences based on Hollywood movies

                Guardian Ranks were unveiled during the Destiny 2 2022 showcase, alongside an in-game Looking-For-Guardian (LFG) system, and a new Commendations system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Altogether, these new individual mechanics make up a social overhaul coming to Destiny in Lightfall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We're going to run you through Guardian Ranks specifically
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given that Lightfall doesn't launch until February of 2022, there's still plenty of time for Bungie to make changes to the Guardian Rank system, so bear that in mind going forward.   Destiny 2 Guardian Ranks are a new type of endgame grind that Bungie will be introducing with Lightfall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The plan is for it to be integrated with the new Commendations system, with a Guardian's rank serving as a simple indicator of how much they've done in Destiny 2, and how many new people they've helped access endgame activities.  The idea behind Destiny 2 Guardian Ranks is to incentivize veteran players to help New Lights (newer players) access some of the game's harder content
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Guardian Ranks are trying to fix that issue
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Newer players will see veterans with high Guardian Ranks and now they can trust them to help them out.  Destiny 2's new Guardian Ranks are just one part of a whole brand new social system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bungie is implementing a new in-game LFG system, which combined with Commendations and Guardian Ranks should serve as a way for newer, solo players to finally access some of the game's Pinnacle content, including Grandmaster Nightfalls and raids.  That's all we really know about Guardian Ranks right now

                Under the new regulations, employers with five or more workers have to increase their workers’ minimum wage from either RM1,100 or RM1,200 to RM1,500
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said cash flow was the major issue faced by mainly MSMEs (micro and small and medium enterprises) on implementing the new minimum wage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Minimum wage is only be viable if jobs are available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Otherwise, minimum wage will only be good on paper,” Syed Hussain said

            <p>
                He said the timing of the minimum wage implementation had been a problem for SMEs

            <p>
                What the government could do was re-categorise companies that could be excluded from implementing the minimum wage, he said

                On August 25th, Sony announced a near-global price hike for the PlayStation 5, citing inflationary pressure and the reduced value of some countries’ currencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This led gamers to ask whether the Xbox or Nintendo Switch would receive a similar price hike—the answer is “no.” Both Nintendo and Microsoft will continue to sell their consoles at current prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our Xbox Series S suggested retail price remains at $299 (£250, €300) the Xbox Series X is $499 (£450, €500).” Earlier this year, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told shareholders that “we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country.” When Eurogamer asked if plans had changed on August 26th, Nintendo simply responded with the previous quote
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, there’s no guarantee that Nintendo or Microsoft will permanently maintain their pricing

                Xbox has recently been trialling letting subscribers share Game Pass with family members, but a recent leak suggests you'll be able to do it with friends too

                Earlier this month, Microsoft started testing a family plan of Game Pass in Colombia and Ireland, which lets you share Game Pass benefits with your family

            <p>
                Currently, in Ireland the cost of the family plan of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs €21.99, a little under double the usual cost of €12.99
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whatever the final branding does end up being, either way it will mean that up to five people will be subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which gives you access to online multiplayer, Game Pass on console and PC, and EA Play access

                Your guide to a better future The Galaxy Watch 5 and 5 Pro are the latest Samsung smartwatches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today only, Woot is offering the first chance we've seen to grab them on sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Samsung's line of Galaxy Watches has long been setting the standard for Android smartwatches -- frequently claiming a top spot on our list of the best smartwatches for the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can pick up a brand-new Galaxy Watch 5 starting at $250, $30 off the usual price, or grab an advanced Galaxy Watch 5 Pro for $400, $50 off its usual price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The step-up Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is only available with a 45mm display, and is on sale for $400 today, which is $50 off the usual price
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's fairly similar to the standard Galaxy Watch 5 in terms of function, but it does feature a more durable titanium body and a larger 590-mAh battery that can keep it going for multiple days at a time

                "I told Aaron-Wooi Yik that, in terms of speed, they’re better and can challenge Ahsan-Hendra, but they need to build self-confidence,” he said in a post-match interview with the Badminton World Federation (BWF) on Sunday (Aug 28)

            <p>
                Rexy said since returning to the BAM as Deputy Coaching Director last October, he had focused more on setting a winning mindset and building confidence in Aaron-Wooi Yik
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I keep telling them, just play for yourself and your parents, and in Aaron’s case - his wife and kids

                "I am very proud of that, and to be honest, I have to say thanks to God, because for the whole week I have been praying to God, asking his blessings for the players to deliver the first title for Malaysia,” he said

                BAM new deputy coaching director Rexy Mainaky reports for duty, Wednesday December 1, 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I told Aaron-Wooi Yik that, in terms of speed, they’re better and can challenge Ahsan-Hendra, but they need to build self-confidence,” he said in a post-match interview with the Badminton World Federation (BWF) on Sunday (Aug 28)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rexy said since returning to the BAM as Deputy Coaching Director last October, he had focused more on setting a winning mindset and building confidence in Aaron-Wooi Yik
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I keep telling them, just play for yourself and your parents, and in Aaron’s case - his wife and kids
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I am very proud of that, and to be honest, I have to say thanks to God, because for the whole week I have been praying to God, asking his blessings for the players to deliver the first title for Malaysia,” he said
            </p>

                Adding another 6.7-inch iPhone to the mix could detract from the iPhone 14 Pro Max's appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple's rumored iPhone 14 Pro Max is expected to have a higher resolution camera, a new processor and a giant 6.7-inch screen like the current iPhone 13 Pro Max
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The iPhone 14 Pro will likely begin at $1,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are a few things Apple could do to make the iPhone 14 Pro Max stand out alongside the regular iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Max
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The iPhone 13 Pro Max, by comparison, has a lot in common with the iPhone 13 Pro, aside from its larger screen and longer battery life
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The iPhone 12 Pro Max was also the second best-selling phone globally in 2021, Counterpoint Research also reported.  Still, until a foldable iPhone comes along, the iPhone Pro Max will be Apple's most expensive and most premium iPhone

                Granted, the price for Malaysian plans is likely to be lower, but would you pay so much money for a streaming plan with ads? In the U.S., Netflix’s current Basic plan starts at USD 9.99 (RM44.84) per month, but it’s only for one user and it does not include HD streaming

                For HD streaming, you’d have to pay at least USD 15.49 (RM69.52) for the Standard plan

                The Malaysian Bar, the Sabah Law Society and the Advocates’ Association of Sarawak jointly such demands for interference in Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s criminal conviction and for the attorney general to be replaced were against Malaysia’s constitutional democracy and its institutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the joint statement, Malaysian Bar president Karen Cheah Yee Lynn, Sabah Law Society president Roger Chin, and Sarawak's Advocates Association president Antonio Sims said that political interference in any case — especially one of tremendous public interest — would encroach on the functions and duties of the attorney general and the court

                “We trust that the prime minister will do the right thing and not to act to the contrary, as that would be an unconscionable abuse of power and a travesty to justice.” The groups reminded the politicians that the primary duty of the attorney general is to uphold the integrity of the justice system within his powers under the Federal Constitution, and the primary duty of the judiciary is to interpret and give effect to the law
            </p>

                “The Malaysian Bar, the Sabah Law Society and the Advocates’ Association of Sarawak condemn any act of politicians seeking for an intervention by the prime minister in an ongoing matter before the judiciary at all material points,” they said

                A new Apple Watch SE and this rugged Apple Watch Pro are also rumored to be announced at the “Far Out” keynote

            <p>
                Longer battery life is going to be a key factor for the “extreme sports” buyers of this Apple Watch, and that is seemingly something Apple is aware of.  Much like the Apple Watch Series 8, this new Apple Watch Pro is expected to add support for body temperature measurements

                In an update on the Google Workspace blog, the company announced that Google Meet will soon give you the ability to unmute yourself by holding down the spacebar and to mute yourself again by releasing it

                If you frequently use Zoom, this feature might sound a lot like its push-to-talk feature — and that’s because it’s essentially the same thing

            <p>
                Once it arrives, it won’t be turned on by default, so you’ll have to enable it from Google Meet’s settings.

                Confusingly, Google’s efforts to merge Duo and Meet have left us with the new Meet app (the one that combines both Duo and Meet), the old Meet (Original) app, and a Duo shortcut that leads to Meet

                The Education Minister said several factors were taken into consideration in preparing the school calendar including the possibility of floods in the East Coast states at the end of the year following the north-east monsoon and the long interval before students could resume their studies after the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) examination
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In managing an examination, one of the biggest challenges faced by the Examination Board is to hold the SPM examination during floods, at times several technical issues arise, making it difficult to conduct the examination," he told reporters after the Tanya DRJ special session during the Hulu Langat District Education Office Open Day here Sunday (Aug 28)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, he said with the existing calendar, students’ learning momentum will be kept going because after the SPM examination, they need not have to wait too long before they could continue their studies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Radzi said all District Education Offices (PPD) need to work on changing the community, school administrators and teachers’ perception that the PPD is only out to find fault when visiting schools even though this was not true
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We want to send the message that the PPD is always open and that we at the Education Department and PPD levels are aware of what is happening down there," he said adding that this would allow top-down and bottom-up communications
