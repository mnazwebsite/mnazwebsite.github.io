            <p>
                Zahid added that the opposition was “spinning” issues to attack BN-Umno but its arguments were incoherent

                Yesterday, the Pejuang chairman was reported to have said that BN-Umno was likely to “win big” if GE15 was held in two to three months as the party felt that the public still looks up to it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid said Mahathir’s admission makes a strong argument for the government to meet the demands of the Umno leadership and grassroots to hold GE15 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Hurry up or Umno and BN will lose GE15,” he said

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 20 — Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob was an unexpected choice to succeed Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, but political observers believe his appointment as Malaysia’s ninth prime minister last year is keeping the nation moving forward through economic and political crises both at home and globally

                Bantuan Keluarga Malaysia, better known as BKM locally, is the direct cash aid initiative under Ismail Sabri’s “Keluarga Malaysia” concept targeted to benefit Malaysian wage earners in the bottom 40 percentile
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia political analyst Kartini Aboo Talib commended Ismail Sabri for enlarging his “Keluarga Malaysia” concept to “Keluarga Global” as instrumental for political stability within Asean during the Covid-19 era

            <p>
                Incidental nation-builder Universiti Sains Malaysia’s political scientist Ahmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid said that Ismail Sabri’s ability to weather the storm shaking Malaysia’s political stability might have helped the 62-year-old increase his support among Malaysians

            <p>
                Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, an associate director with Vriens & Partners — a public policy, government affairs and political risk consultancy — said Ismail Sabri’s biggest contribution in his first year as PM was showing he has political will to push through institutional and health reforms

                Ravinthran, and Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, also affirmed the decision of the High Court that disallowed Aminah Abdullah’s application for a declaration that six million shares in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd were also part of her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision in an online proceeding yesterday, dismissed the appeal brought by Jamaluddin’s children – Ikhwan Hafiz and Nur Anis – and the cross-appeal by Aminah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah was appealing against the High Court’s dismissal of her application to include the Alpine Motion and Ivory Insights shares as part of her son’s estate, while her grandchildren were appealing against the High Court’s ruling to put the Rantai Wawasan shares in the list of their father’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan said the Rantai Wawasan shares should be included in Jamaluddin’s estate as the trust deed which was created in 2009 when Jamaluddin was alive was valid and that the trust deed created in 2015 by Jamaluddin’s children after his (Jamaluddin’s) demise was null and void
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah is seeking to include the three million Rantai Wawasan shares worth RM1.44bil, six million Alpine Motion shares worth RM233mil and two Ivory Insights shares worth RM80mil in her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her statement of claim, Aminah claimed that her grandchildren failed to enter the shares of the three companies – Rantai Wawasan, Alpine Motion and Ivory Insight – as part of the deceased’s estate with the intention of denying her rights and interests as a beneficiary

                The four assemblymen are also seeking to stop the state assembly from declaring their seats vacant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The state government has said it intends to table a motion in the state assembly to declare the seats vacant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The assembly will meet in October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He contended that the provision in the state constitution is valid, based on a recent unanimous decision of the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We also want to know the court’s decision regarding this issue after the Federal Court’s ruling,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any special sitting (of the state assembly to declare the seats vacant) would have to wait for the court decision, he told reporters in response to a call by DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng for a special sitting of the Penang state assembly

                Thomas, who resigned as AG on Feb 28, 2020 was a founder and consultant or partner of the legal firm, while his partners also had financial interest in the firm

                In the statement of claim, Mahathir alleged that Ahmad Zahid's statement was done in malice, defamatory and with the intention of having the people hate him
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, Ahmad Zahid sought the court to strike out Mahathir's suit with costs

            <p>
                Prior to this Ahmad Zahid had also filed a defamation suit against Mahathir for alleging that the Umno president had sought his help with his ongoing court cases

            <p>
                The JKSTUPKK report disclosed that Zahid, as defence minister in 2011, had sided with the contractor, Boustead Naval Shipyard (BNS) instead of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN), the end-user for the six LCS ordered by the government

                Lim said Zahid owes the public an explanation on why he ignored the RMN’s recommendation for Sigma LCS and instead unilaterally chose to go with the Gowind LCS

                He also took to task Defence Minister Datuk Hishamuddin Hussein for still keeping quiet about his ministry’s decision to halve the number of LCS that must be completed and delivered to the RMN by the contractor with no additional government funds

            <p>
                “When Hishammuddin appeared before the Public Accounts Committee on 25th January 2022, he spoke about ‘corporate restructuring’ of the RM9 billion LCS contract and that the contractor, BNS, will have to deliver two LCS without any new cost to the government

                The Human Resources Minister said the scheme to cover homemakers against injuries suffered while tending to their chores would be managed by the Social Security Organisation (Socso)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 26, the Dewan Rakyat passed the Housewives Social Security Bill (HSS), which allows husbands to voluntarily contribute to the scheme for their wives below the age of 55
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if the definition of housewife would be widened to cover husbands who assume the role of homemakers as well, Saravanan said the ministry would need an in-depth study to see the number of house husbands involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No action would be taken against any husband who did not contribute.” However, he noted that husbands who have signed up to contribute and failed to maintain it monthly would be fined RM10,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saravanan also said the amendments passed in the Employment Insurance System Act 2017 (Act 800) and Employees’ Social Security Act 1969 (Act 4) to increase the maximum monthly salary ceiling limit from RM4,000 to RM5,000 would come into effect next month

            <p>
                RECENTLY, it has been said that a lawyer climbed across balconies into an adjacent unit to record a video of a neighbour bathing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As their toilets were next to each other, Yeo could tell when the victim was in the shower by listening for her voice or the sound of videos playing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the evening of Nov 23, 2020, he deduced that she was bathing and climbed over the parapet and into her balcony to film her
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He held his phone outside the shower window but the victim caught a glimpse of the phone before he could start recording
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He later deleted the video

                The movement, he added, planned to highlight at least 30 issues that arose under Ismail’s government — which celebrates its first year anniversary tomorrow — including inflation, the lack of employment opportunities, price hikes and exorbitant house prices

                The secretariat’s spokesman, Syahmi Shamsudin, said the movement, which comprises 10 organisations and NGOs, would hold talks and protests to urge the public to reject the current government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The movement, he added, planned to highlight at least 30 issues that arose under Ismail’s government — which celebrates its first year anniversary tomorrow — including inflation, the lack of employment opportunities, price hikes and exorbitant house prices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syahmi said the movement was in the midst of planning the nationwide tour

            <p>
                Commenting on the change of strategy, Muda secretary-general Amir Abd Hadi said it was best for them to mobilise the campaign nationwide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Amir said the campaign was not limited to only opposition parties but to everyone, including supporters of pro-government parties who reject Ismail

                “Umno does not want the opposition to continue its attacks against BN in the months to come, if the polls are only held next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid added that the opposition was “spinning” issues to attack BN-Umno but its arguments were incoherent

                Yesterday, the Pejuang chairman was reported to have said that BN-Umno was likely to “win big” if GE15 was held in two to three months as the party felt that the public still looks up to it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zahid said Mahathir’s admission makes a strong argument for the government to meet the demands of the Umno leadership and grassroots to hold GE15 this year
            </p>
            
            <p>

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 20 — Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob was an unexpected choice to succeed Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, but political observers believe his appointment as Malaysia’s ninth prime minister last year is keeping the nation moving forward through economic and political crises both at home and globally

                Bantuan Keluarga Malaysia, better known as BKM locally, is the direct cash aid initiative under Ismail Sabri’s “Keluarga Malaysia” concept targeted to benefit Malaysian wage earners in the bottom 40 percentile
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia political analyst Kartini Aboo Talib commended Ismail Sabri for enlarging his “Keluarga Malaysia” concept to “Keluarga Global” as instrumental for political stability within Asean during the Covid-19 era

            <p>
                Incidental nation-builder Universiti Sains Malaysia’s political scientist Ahmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid said that Ismail Sabri’s ability to weather the storm shaking Malaysia’s political stability might have helped the 62-year-old increase his support among Malaysians

            <p>
                Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, an associate director with Vriens & Partners — a public policy, government affairs and political risk consultancy — said Ismail Sabri’s biggest contribution in his first year as PM was showing he has political will to push through institutional and health reforms

                Ravinthran, and Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, also affirmed the decision of the High Court that disallowed Aminah Abdullah’s application for a declaration that six million shares in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd were also part of her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision in an online proceeding yesterday, dismissed the appeal brought by Jamaluddin’s children – Ikhwan Hafiz and Nur Anis – and the cross-appeal by Aminah
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah was appealing against the High Court’s dismissal of her application to include the Alpine Motion and Ivory Insights shares as part of her son’s estate, while her grandchildren were appealing against the High Court’s ruling to put the Rantai Wawasan shares in the list of their father’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan said the Rantai Wawasan shares should be included in Jamaluddin’s estate as the trust deed which was created in 2009 when Jamaluddin was alive was valid and that the trust deed created in 2015 by Jamaluddin’s children after his (Jamaluddin’s) demise was null and void
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aminah is seeking to include the three million Rantai Wawasan shares worth RM1.44bil, six million Alpine Motion shares worth RM233mil and two Ivory Insights shares worth RM80mil in her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In her statement of claim, Aminah claimed that her grandchildren failed to enter the shares of the three companies – Rantai Wawasan, Alpine Motion and Ivory Insight – as part of the deceased’s estate with the intention of denying her rights and interests as a beneficiary

                The four assemblymen are also seeking to stop the state assembly from declaring their seats vacant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The state government has said it intends to table a motion in the state assembly to declare the seats vacant
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The assembly will meet in October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He contended that the provision in the state constitution is valid, based on a recent unanimous decision of the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We also want to know the court’s decision regarding this issue after the Federal Court’s ruling,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any special sitting (of the state assembly to declare the seats vacant) would have to wait for the court decision, he told reporters in response to a call by DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng for a special sitting of the Penang state assembly

                Thomas, who resigned as AG on Feb 28, 2020 was a founder and consultant or partner of the legal firm, while his partners also had financial interest in the firm

                In the statement of claim, Mahathir alleged that Ahmad Zahid's statement was done in malice, defamatory and with the intention of having the people hate him
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, Ahmad Zahid sought the court to strike out Mahathir's suit with costs

            <p>
                Prior to this Ahmad Zahid had also filed a defamation suit against Mahathir for alleging that the Umno president had sought his help with his ongoing court cases

            <p>
                The JKSTUPKK report disclosed that Zahid, as defence minister in 2011, had sided with the contractor, Boustead Naval Shipyard (BNS) instead of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN), the end-user for the six LCS ordered by the government

                Lim said Zahid owes the public an explanation on why he ignored the RMN’s recommendation for Sigma LCS and instead unilaterally chose to go with the Gowind LCS

                He also took to task Defence Minister Datuk Hishamuddin Hussein for still keeping quiet about his ministry’s decision to halve the number of LCS that must be completed and delivered to the RMN by the contractor with no additional government funds

            <p>
                “When Hishammuddin appeared before the Public Accounts Committee on 25th January 2022, he spoke about ‘corporate restructuring’ of the RM9 billion LCS contract and that the contractor, BNS, will have to deliver two LCS without any new cost to the government

                The Human Resources Minister said the scheme to cover homemakers against injuries suffered while tending to their chores would be managed by the Social Security Organisation (Socso)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On July 26, the Dewan Rakyat passed the Housewives Social Security Bill (HSS), which allows husbands to voluntarily contribute to the scheme for their wives below the age of 55
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked if the definition of housewife would be widened to cover husbands who assume the role of homemakers as well, Saravanan said the ministry would need an in-depth study to see the number of house husbands involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No action would be taken against any husband who did not contribute.” However, he noted that husbands who have signed up to contribute and failed to maintain it monthly would be fined RM10,000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saravanan also said the amendments passed in the Employment Insurance System Act 2017 (Act 800) and Employees’ Social Security Act 1969 (Act 4) to increase the maximum monthly salary ceiling limit from RM4,000 to RM5,000 would come into effect next month

                In a statement this afternoon, he said that the report found that LCS subcontractors had paid €43.69 million, equivalent to RM210 million, based on invoices from a French firm

            <p>
                RECENTLY, it has been said that a lawyer climbed across balconies into an adjacent unit to record a video of a neighbour bathing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As their toilets were next to each other, Yeo could tell when the victim was in the shower by listening for her voice or the sound of videos playing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the evening of Nov 23, 2020, he deduced that she was bathing and climbed over the parapet and into her balcony to film her
            </p>
