                Once Auto realizes she’s “gone,” it can take multiple minutes for it to then auto-connect to my phone

                In a blog post, Google explains that it’s launching a new cross-device software development kit (SDK) that contains the tools developers need to make their apps play nice across Android devices, and, eventually non-Android phones, tablets, TVs, cars, and more

                In April, Esper’s Mishaal Rahman spotted an upcoming Nearby Share update that could let you quickly share files across the devices that you’re signed into Google with

                Qualcomm has launched three chipsets based on the 4nm manufacturing process under the new naming scheme until now - Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, and Snapdragon 7 Gen 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thanks to reliable leakster Evan Blass, we now know the company will also launch a Snapdragon 6 series chip with the same naming convention, called Snapdragon 6 Gen 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC consists of a Kryo CPU clocked at up to 2.2GHz, but we don't know the number of cores
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 will also be able to record 4K HDR videos at 30 FPS and slow-mo videos at 240 FPS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Snapdragon 6 Gen 1's specs There's no word from Qualcomm about the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 yet, but we might see it go official alongside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 flagship chip at this year's Snapdragon Summit, which will be hosted in Hawaii between November 15-17

                According to an army statement today, the PT-91M Pendekar had just finished taking part in the parade and was on its way to the vehicle parking area before stopping suddenly due to engine problems at 10.30am

            <p>

            <p>
                As per a report from GalaxyClub, Google and Samsung are already working on a third-generation Tensor SoC, which should power next year's Pixel 8 lineup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the one hand, it's no surprise that Google and Samsung will continue to work on their joint venture but on the other, it's not the first time Google has killed a project or two
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, the first-generation Tensor chipset isn't exactly on par with the competition from Qualcomm and Apple
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Tensor's advantage, however, is that Google has the freedom to tailor the SoC to its needs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the leak doesn't go into details so aside from the Tensor 3's S5P9865 model number and the fact that it's being tested on a developer board codenamed "Ripcurrent", there's nothing else we can work with

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Much like Inazuma, players can collect blueprints for five craftable weapons in Sumeru
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The special currency "Stories of You and the Aranara" can be exchanged with Aravinay who will be located near the Tree of Dreams in Vanarana
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fortunately, Genshin Impact players can use the crafting bench to craft Midlander Billets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lastly, Genshin Impact players will require 50 Crystal Chunk, 50 White Iron Chunk, and 500 Mora to forge the desired craftable weapon
            </p>

                Stating that he has received reports of the public’s “deteriorating trust in BN”, Muhyiddin said that he read with great interest a recent statement by Umno president (Ahmad Zahid Hamidi) that GE15 — which can be held as late as mid-September 2023 — should be held this year

                Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob yesterday played down speculation that the decision to bring the tabling of Budget 2023 forward by three weeks was linked to GE15, which is expected by many to be held this year

            <p>
                Touching on Budget 2023, Muhyiddin said it was likely that Parliament will be dissolved the day after it is tabled, that is on Oct 8

                Hendra, 38, and Ahsan, 35 next month, are possibly one of the oldest pairs to reach the final and Kien Keat urged Aaron, 25, and Wooi Yik, 27, to take advantage of the age factor

            <p>
                But Hendra is 38 while Ahsan is 35 and Aaron-Wooi Yik should take the age factor to their advantage

                Adding another 6.7-inch iPhone to the mix could detract from the iPhone 14 Pro Max's appeal

                Apple's rumored iPhone 14 Pro Max is expected to have a higher resolution camera, a new processor and a giant 6.7-inch screen like the current iPhone 13 Pro Max

                There are a few things Apple could do to make the iPhone 14 Pro Max stand out alongside the regular iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Max
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The iPhone 13 Pro Max, by comparison, has a lot in common with the iPhone 13 Pro, aside from its larger screen and longer battery life

            <p>
                The iPhone 12 Pro Max was also the second best-selling phone globally in 2021, Counterpoint Research also reported.  Still, until a foldable iPhone comes along, the iPhone Pro Max will be Apple's most expensive and most premium iPhone

                ADOR, the agency of NewJeans, has shared an explanation regarding the controversy over the group’s song “Cookie.” “Cookie” is one of the four tracks of their first EP, and fans pointed out that it isn’t an appropriate song for minors to sing because of the sexual connotations
            </p>

            <p>
                The underlying message of the song is the value of NewJeans’ attempt to make new and original music
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s why, even though we produce NewJeans’ music and all the related content for everyone to enjoy, it “ain’t for free” and can only be found at our place ADOR, pointing listeners toward the whole message the group ultimately aims to convey through their debut album
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ADOR team didn’t take any issue with the lyrics to “Cookie” when we were making the album because our vision for original and wholesome music was crystal clear to us
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Everyone at ADOR will do their best going forward to prevent any further misunderstanding

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The underlying message of the song is the value of NewJeans’ attempt to make new and original music
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s why, even though we produce NewJeans’ music and all the related content for everyone to enjoy, it “ain’t for free” and can only be found at our place ADOR, pointing listeners toward the whole message the group ultimately aims to convey through their debut album
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The ADOR team didn’t take any issue with the lyrics to “Cookie” when we were making the album because our vision for original and wholesome music was crystal clear to us
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Everyone at ADOR will do their best going forward to prevent any further misunderstanding

                Speaking at the Perikatan Nasional Convention here on Saturday (Aug 27), Abdul Hadi said Pakatan spent too much time bickering over the prime ministership that it ignored real issues
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abdul Hadi added that a crisis was caused by squabbling over the prime minister’s post, saying that Pakatan forgot about the real issues that should be prioritised

                Being the mid-season update, October 5 is our best guess for the final mid-season update the title will receive

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The final mid-season update for the game will be released soon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Being the mid-season update, October 5 is our best guess for the final mid-season update the title will receive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Two more villains from the series will come to the game with the mid-season update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are yet to see how the mid-season update changes the game, but till then, we can only wait and speculate.

            <p>
                Rosmah was charged with three counts of corruption linked to the RM1.25 billion Sarawak rural schools’ solar energy project

                With the argument that a 6-inch smartphone cannot really be considered “compact” and Sony using the tagline “Go compact” in its new teasers, it could be argued that an unexpected compact phone is about to be launched.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Interestingly, the Sony Xperia 5 IV or Xperia Compact in the clip appears to have a light gold colorway, although there is nothing else that is too discernible about the device’s showing here.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fortunately, the new Sony Xperia is much less shy in the next clip, which also has Burns talking about her recording experiences with the smartphone

            <p>
                In addition, the potential Sony Xperia 5 IV here has a slightly different, but still distinctive and appealing, shape than that of the Xperia 5 III.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the Xperia 5 IV expected to have a 6-inch display, there has been some call for Sony to produce what could be considered an actual compact smartphone akin to something like the iPhone 13 mini, which offered a 5.4-inch diagonal for its screen

                There are certainly pointers that this particular Xperia device being teased now could end up being a new Xperia Compact, perhaps even a distant successor to 2018’s Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact that packed a powerful punch behind a 5.0-inch display

                Liverpool need to start Fábio Carvalho at Anfield against Bournemouth

            <p>
                £5m signing Fábio Carvalho is simply a must against Bournemouth — a team he started against last season for Fulham in the Championship — and he could really help Liverpool move things around

            <p>
                Alongside him could sit Jordan Henderson in a midfield two — more than enough against Bournemouth, particularly at home
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In front of that duo could be an attacking three of Carvalho, Luis Díaz and Elliott
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bringing Carvalho into the side is not a drastic change for Klopp to make for Bournemouth, and given that is the case, a move to a proper 4-2-3-1 — rather than a 4-3-3 where the midfield balance is not quite right — makes perfect sense

                The recent PS5 console price increase seems to have gotten Japanese gamers in a flap over the fact they’ve got to pay out more money for the machine to be able to play Final Fantasy 16
            </p>
            
            <p>

                According to @aitaikimochi on Twitter (thanks GamesRadar), many Japanese players are worried that PS5 console shortages coupled with the roughly 20% increase in the price of the console in their country — now ¥60,478 for the disc version and ¥49,478 for the digital version — means they won’t be able to play Final Fantasy 16 when it is released

                While many were worried they wouldn’t be able to play Final Fantasy 16 on PS5, others started to petition for a Steam version or even a version on Epic Games Store

                The best way to deal with these issues is to reset the earbuds

            <p>
                For this step, your Galaxy Buds 2 Pro should already be set up and successfully paired with your device of choice

                Look for an Earbuds Settings or General option to choose

                Confirm that you want to fully reset your Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro

            <p>
                Once out of the case, the app should detect the earbuds and ask if you want to set them up

                If that doesn’t fix the problem, you need to try to couple the earbuds together again

                The best way to deal with these issues is to reset the earbuds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For this step, your Galaxy Buds 2 Pro should already be set up and successfully paired with your device of choice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Look for an Earbuds Settings or General option to choose
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Confirm that you want to fully reset your Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once out of the case, the app should detect the earbuds and ask if you want to set them up
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If that doesn’t fix the problem, you need to try to couple the earbuds together again

                Earlier this month, the company rebranded its Duo video chat app as Meet and brought over Meet’s features
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That left the original, to-be-phased-out Meet app with a new “Meet (Original)” name

            <p>
                With the latest update to the Meet app for Android, Google has brought back the original Duo icon and name as a separate shortcut that appears in the app launcher

            <p>
                Google told 9to5Google and Droid Life that it made this move intentionally so that users would be able to launch Meet by searching for “Duo,” just like they had done before it was rebranded

                Someday we’ll end up with just Messages, Google Chat, and Google Meet after all of this — sadly, without the clean, simple FaceTime alternative that Duo once was — but the road there is proving quite convoluted

                The three-page document was published on the Malaysia Today portal run by Raja Petra, titled; “Rosmah Mansor will be pronounced guilty on 1st September 2022”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decision for Rosmah’s solar hybrid graft trial at the High Court is scheduled to be delivered on September 1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Raja Petra, the alleged guilty verdict was not written by the trial judge but on behalf of the trial judge by persons unknown

                At the time of writing, the Office of the Chief Registrar of the Federal Court of Malaysia has yet to issue any official statement over the purported leak

            <p>
                Last week, court officials lodged a police report over the leaked draft judgment in relation to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s final appeal at the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a similar fashion, the alleged leaked documents were published on Raja Petra’s portal, with the Office of the Chief Registrar of the Federal Court of Malaysia insisting that it was a draft judgment that had not been finalised yet, and that the document had been modified.

                Former national shuttler Roslin Hashim feels that world number five Zii Jia had wasted a golden opportunity to prove that his decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games was right by getting bundled out in the third round in Japan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Commenting on yesterday’s game, Roslin said one could see that Jun Peng was fully prepared to take on Zii Jia while the Malaysian clearly seemed to be playing under pressure, especially when the China shuttler bounced back from the first-game defeat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another former national shuttler, Ong Ewe Hock believes that Zii Jia must use the disappointment in Japan as a lesson to do even better in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ewe Hock, however, admitted that perhaps Zii Jia still needs time to get used to his decision to go professional after quitting the Badminton Association of Malaysia early this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Regarding Zii Jia, I don’t know whether he failed or not (in Tokyo) because I believe he was under a lot of pressure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gerard had previously expressed his disappointment and shock at Zii Jia’s decision to skip the Commonwealth Games 2022 as the shuttler was one of Malaysia’s gold medal prospects at the quadrennial Games in Birmingham

                Former national shuttler Roslin Hashim feels that world number five Zii Jia had wasted a golden opportunity to prove that his decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games was right by getting bundled out in the third round in Japan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Commenting on yesterday’s game, Roslin said one could see that Jun Peng was fully prepared to take on Zii Jia while the Malaysian clearly seemed to be playing under pressure, especially when the China shuttler bounced back from the first-game defeat
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another former national shuttler, Ong Ewe Hock believes that Zii Jia must use the disappointment in Japan as a lesson to do even better in the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ewe Hock, however, admitted that perhaps Zii Jia still needs time to get used to his decision to go professional after quitting the Badminton Association of Malaysia early this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Regarding Zii Jia, I don’t know whether he failed or not (in Tokyo) because I believe he was under a lot of pressure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gerard had previously expressed his disappointment and shock at Zii Jia’s decision to skip the Commonwealth Games 2022 as the shuttler was one of Malaysia’s gold medal prospects at the quadrennial Games in Birmingham

                The former 1MDB chief executive officer said this during cross-examination by defence lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah in the 1MDB audit tampering trial where Arul is the co-accused, along with former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak

            <p>
                Muhammad Shafee, who represents Najib, was questioning Arul about former auditor-general Tan Sri Ambrin Buang's frustration with the lack of cooperation by 1MDB throughout the audit process

                Muhammad Shafee then asked who was responsible for the suppression of information from auditors, to which Arul said the former 1MDB chief financial officer (CFO) Azmi Tahir was the person in charge with dealing with the NAD
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib, 69, is accused of abusing his position to order amendments to the 1MDB final audit report to avoid any action being taken against him while Arul Kanda is accused of abetting Najib in making the amendments

                Manchester United are keen to complete a deal for Ajax and Brazil winger Antony this month Erik ten Hag is desperate to add further signings to build on Man United's win over Liverpool One player they hope to bring in is Ajax winger Antony who has been linked with a reunion with his former boss, while United are also interested in a £38million move for Dutch winger Cody Gakpo from PSV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Antony may have beaten Gakpo to the league title with PSV finishing just two points behind Ten Hag's side last season, but the Dutch star outshines Antony in numerous measures
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gakpo's 3.6 dribbles per game would have him clear compared to United's players last year, while he created 3.3 chances per game in the Eredivisie in contrast to Antony's 1.9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite Antony's undoubted class and pedigree, along with his close working relationship with Ten Hag from their time in Holland, the statistics of Gakpo do raise questions over the move for Antony

                He is top class.' Antony's form has alerted several top European clubs, but United are favourites for his signature  While Ajax are insistent that Antony won't be sold, the Brazilian has made it clear he wants to join United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A second £80m bid is expected from United and Antony is confident that he will be able to conclude a move before the transfer window shuts

                But the iPhone is much more than that and this year the world could do with having one released just a little earlier than usual
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Apple may just save the day, at least cosmetically
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s little evidence to suggest that timing has any influence on total sales of a given iPhone model, but the release date has a direct impact on the financial period during which revenue is recorded.  Apple, in its cute, idiosyncratic way, has a unique earnings calendar with the quarter and financial year ending around a week before the end of September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One week out of 52 doesn’t seem like much, but the iPhone’s annual release cycle coupled with anticipatory excitement makes that initial sales period the most important seven-day window of Apple’s financial year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Recent data show that timing impacts what proportion of iPhone revenue occurs during that September quarter
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                But the iPhone is much more than that and this year the world could do with having one released just a little earlier than usual
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Apple may just save the day, at least cosmetically
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s little evidence to suggest that timing has any influence on total sales of a given iPhone model, but the release date has a direct impact on the financial period during which revenue is recorded.  Apple, in its cute, idiosyncratic way, has a unique earnings calendar with the quarter and financial year ending around a week before the end of September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One week out of 52 doesn’t seem like much, but the iPhone’s annual release cycle coupled with anticipatory excitement makes that initial sales period the most important seven-day window of Apple’s financial year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Recent data show that timing impacts what proportion of iPhone revenue occurs during that September quarter

                Amir, 31, pleaded not guilty to the charge before magistrate Fardiana Haryanti Ahmad Razali
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the charge sheet, Amir, as the organiser of the gathering, had failed to inform the officer in charge at the Dang Wangi district police headquarters five days before holding the assembly in front of the Sogo Complex at Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman at 2pm on Aug 14
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The charge was framed under Section 9 (1) of the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012, with the offence punishable with a maximum fine of RM10,000 under Section 9 (5) of the same Act, upon conviction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deputy public prosecutors Radzi Shah Ab Razak and Fatin Hanum Abdul Hadi offered bail of RM10,000 and proposed that Amir surrender his passport to the court and refrain from making any comment on the case on social media

            <p>
                Another defence lawyer, Raj Surian Pillai, objected to the proposal for Amir to surrender his passport, saying he was not a flight risk

                From the iPhone 14 to the Apple Watch Series 8, there are a few products that feel like shoo-ins this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple has released a new iPhone every September (except for 2020, when the pandemic pushed things back a month), and we're not expecting things to be any different in 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Apple Watch also tends to receive an upgrade at the same time as the iPhone 14 – although changes to Apple's wearable are often a little more incremental
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But while the Apple Watch Series 8 (opens in new tab) is expected to borrow the same design (again!), rumours of a brand new Watch model are a little more intriguing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The so-called Apple Watch Pro is said to be offering the first redesign since the Apple Watch Series 4 (when things got a tiny bit rounder and thinner)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If there's one Apple product that's due some design love, it's the entry-level iPad

                The PKR deputy president was responding to Dr Abdul Latiff’s latest Facebook post this morning denying again that he was married to a woman named Zainab Mohd Salleh or having any links to the naval procurement assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If Dr Latiff has nothing to do with Zainab Mohd Salleh and he (or his family) are not involved with the LCS project contracts or naval defence, he should immediately file a lawsuit against BHIC (the owner of the LCS forensic report), Alliance Alliance IFA (M) Sdn Bhd (the BHIC appointed auditor that investigated the LCS project) and me (who exposed this matter),” Rafizi said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi also said that Dr Abdul Latiff did not address the forensic report findings that Mega P Asia Sdn Bhd was a company controlled by Zainab that had been awarded the naval defence contracts or that records from the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) showed they were joint owners of the company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Dr Abdul Latiff’s Facebook denial is akin to accusing SSM of cheating,” he said

                The PKR deputy president was responding to Dr Abdul Latiff’s latest Facebook post this morning denying again that he was married to a woman named Zainab Mohd Salleh or having any links to the naval procurement assets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If Dr Latiff has nothing to do with Zainab Mohd Salleh and he (or his family) are not involved with the LCS project contracts or naval defence, he should immediately file a lawsuit against BHIC (the owner of the LCS forensic report), Alliance Alliance IFA (M) Sdn Bhd (the BHIC appointed auditor that investigated the LCS project) and me (who exposed this matter),” Rafizi said in a statement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi also said that Dr Abdul Latiff did not address the forensic report findings that Mega P Asia Sdn Bhd was a company controlled by Zainab that had been awarded the naval defence contracts or that records from the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) showed they were joint owners of the company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Dr Abdul Latiff’s Facebook denial is akin to accusing SSM of cheating,” he said

                More info Liverpool could ultimately be forced to miss out on the signing of a new central midfielder this summer, with two of their reported targets said to be on course to join other clubs ahead of next week's all-important deadline
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp has been urged to move for a new playmaker before the summer transfer window slams shut and a number of potential targets, including the likes of Leandro Paredes and Marco Asensio, have been linked with Liverpool over the last few weeks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Talks are now underway at club level in order to reach a compromise over a transfer fee, which suggests that Liverpool will come up short in the race to secure the Argentina international's signature in the near future.Liverpool have also been tentatively linked with a move for Asensio, who has been tipped to leave Real Madrid in the final days of the summer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Spaniard is said to have emerged as a target for Manchester United, with the Red Devils having been on the lookout for a new midfielder all summer but to no avail as of yet

                Talks are now underway at club level in order to reach a compromise over a transfer fee, which suggests that Liverpool will come up short in the race to secure the Argentina international's signature in the near future.Liverpool have also been tentatively linked with a move for Asensio, who has been tipped to leave Real Madrid in the final days of the summer window

                However, the Spaniard is said to have emerged as a target for Manchester United, with the Red Devils having been on the lookout for a new midfielder all summer but to no avail as of yet

                So the biggest upgrade to the iPhone 14 lineup this year is likely to be the addition of the iPhone 14 Max
            </p>
            
            <p>
                iPhone 13 runs on the A15 processor, this means that iPhone 14 series will be powered by the A16
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They claim that A16 would be reserved for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                while iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max models would get the year-old A15 processor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 cost the same as their predecessors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, some reports claim that this feature may be exclusive to the high-end iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 26 — Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Special Functions) Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad today denied that his wife is named Zainab Mohd Salleh, the name of the woman linked to the controversial littoral combat ship (LCS) scandal
            </p>

                On Monday, news portal MalaysiaNow reported that Zainab is allegedly one of the owners of a company which is involved in the LCS project as being "dubiously addressed in Paris although payment to it was released in Singapore, a pattern rampant among other contractors awarded with the LCS work." It also reported that Zainab’s name was allegedly linked to another company that had received millions of dollars for the LCS project through suspicious foreign accounts

                In Malaysia, four variants will be offered, namely the Tech, Pro, Ultra and Ultra G
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both the Tech and Pro will come with a 47.8-kWh lithium iron phosphate battery that can provide up to 400 km of range in the NEDC cycle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That crossover has a WLTP range of 305 km
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Note that the Good Cat’s quoted range is in the older NEDC standard, and not the latest WLTP cycle that most carmakers use today – WLTP typically pulls the range figure down by around 20% – we explain this in the review
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kit wise, what you see here should be very close to our range-topping Ultra G

                In Malaysia, four variants will be offered, namely the Tech, Pro, Ultra and Ultra G
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both the Tech and Pro will come with a 47.8-kWh lithium iron phosphate battery that can provide up to 400 km of range in the NEDC cycle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That crossover has a WLTP range of 305 km
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Note that the Good Cat’s quoted range is in the older NEDC standard, and not the latest WLTP cycle that most carmakers use today – WLTP typically pulls the range figure down by around 20% – we explain this in the review
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kit wise, what you see here should be very close to our range-topping Ultra G

                On the role of masks in preventing the spread of Covid-19, Prof Moy said prior to the vaccines, ecological studies found that transmission was 7.5 times higher in countries that did not have a mask mandate or require universal mask use

                Fortunately, there are other apps that do what MyFitnessPal does, and many of them do it better
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcode scanners are standard in the free version of plenty of apps, so let’s highlight one excellent alternative, and a few honorable mentions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The free version of Cronometer has a barcode scanner
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (I’m sure they’re in there somewhere.) And from a few items I scanned around the house, it sure seems like Cronometer’s barcode scanner is better than MFP’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s no option to maintain your weight or to gain weight, only different rates of weight loss
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you get started, though, the interface is straightforward, and the barcode scanner works well

                Fortunately, there are other apps that do what MyFitnessPal does, and many of them do it better
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcode scanners are standard in the free version of plenty of apps, so let’s highlight one excellent alternative, and a few honorable mentions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The free version of Cronometer has a barcode scanner
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (I’m sure they’re in there somewhere.) And from a few items I scanned around the house, it sure seems like Cronometer’s barcode scanner is better than MFP’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s no option to maintain your weight or to gain weight, only different rates of weight loss
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you get started, though, the interface is straightforward, and the barcode scanner works well

                According to the daily, it is estimated that RM984 million was spent to build the 82 PLKN campsites in the country, most of which are now redundant, even though the government had tried to revive these camps by renting them out to other parties

                Many leaders in Umno privately want the king to pardon Najib but it will take some time to see through the process
            </p>

                In Najib’s case, there’s no indication yet that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob will back a petition for a royal pardon.  “It depends on what sort of deal Najib can get with Ismail Sabri and whether the PM will support him,” said James Chin, a professor of Asian Studies at the University of Tasmania who looks at governance issues in Southeast Asia

                His decision saw Umno retake the reins of power following a two-year absence.  Many leaders in Umno privately want the king to pardon Najib but it will take some time to see through the process

                Najib has to serve some jail time first before getting his pardon, though he has to make the petition within 14 days from the date of the appeal decision or else he loses his Parliament seat.  If he fails to get a pardon, he will be disqualified from the elections for five years after he is released from jail

                The king deliberates on petitions in consultation with the Pardons Board.  Mahathir told Bloomberg News earlier this week that he saw a “50-50 chance” that Najib would eventually get a pardon

                But more recently, the three tech giants have become competitors with one another when it comes to high-end wireless earbuds.  Samsung's latest entry is the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, while Google joined in on the fun with the Pixel Buds Pro, and Apple has long had the AirPods Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why? Because the Pixel Buds Pro supports multipoint connections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And that's true regardless of what company makes the devices involved.  For instance, during my testing of the Pixel Buds Pro, I often had them connected to a Pixel 6 Pro and a MacBook Air
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the AirPods Pro, you pair them with a single device – let's say an iPhone – and your AirPods are instantly linked to every Apple device that's signed in using the same iCloud account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's similar to 360 Audio on the Buds 2 Pro, while the Pixel Buds Pro are supposed to get Spatial Audio later this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I've yet to find another pair of wireless earbuds that comes close to the overall sound quality of the AirPods Pro

            <p>
                But more recently, the three tech giants have become competitors with one another when it comes to high-end wireless earbuds.  Samsung's latest entry is the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, while Google joined in on the fun with the Pixel Buds Pro, and Apple has long had the AirPods Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why? Because the Pixel Buds Pro supports multipoint connections
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And that's true regardless of what company makes the devices involved.  For instance, during my testing of the Pixel Buds Pro, I often had them connected to a Pixel 6 Pro and a MacBook Air
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the AirPods Pro, you pair them with a single device – let's say an iPhone – and your AirPods are instantly linked to every Apple device that's signed in using the same iCloud account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's similar to 360 Audio on the Buds 2 Pro, while the Pixel Buds Pro are supposed to get Spatial Audio later this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I've yet to find another pair of wireless earbuds that comes close to the overall sound quality of the AirPods Pro
            </p>

                We’ve had a chance to try out Samsung’s kickstand case for the Galaxy Z Fold 4, which looked promising but ultimately isn’t quite what most were expecting.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The “Slim Standing Cover” for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 is a two-piece case that includes a bumper for the front display, a full cover for the back of the phone, and a kickstand built-in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unfortunately, this isn’t what the “Slim Standing Cover” for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 does

            <p>
                That’s not to say this is a bad case

            <p>
                But, it’s a little disappointing that the kickstand isn’t adjustable at all

                I’d love to see Samsung take a note from Nintendo in the Fold 4’s kickstand case

                @NexusBen As Android 13 makes its way to Pixels and other devices, Samsung is working on its own take on the update with the One UI 5.0 beta, which just picked up its second version that includes a new “Privacy Detection” feature.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Available now in select regions – now including India and the UK – One UI 5.0 beta 2 brings a relatively minor update on top of the first beta
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond that, One UI 5.0 beta 2 also adds a new “Smart Suggestions” widget which can suggest which apps to open
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s also the new Maintenance Mode which prevents personal data from being accessed when you send in a phone for repair
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another new feature is Privacy Detection

                @NexusBen As Android 13 makes its way to Pixels and other devices, Samsung is working on its own take on the update with the One UI 5.0 beta, which just picked up its second version that includes a new “Privacy Detection” feature.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Available now in select regions – now including India and the UK – One UI 5.0 beta 2 brings a relatively minor update on top of the first beta
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond that, One UI 5.0 beta 2 also adds a new “Smart Suggestions” widget which can suggest which apps to open
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s also the new Maintenance Mode which prevents personal data from being accessed when you send in a phone for repair
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another new feature is Privacy Detection

                Honor has announced two new mobile devices, the Honor 70 smartphone and the Honor Pad 8 tablet, both of which will be available at the beginning of September in the U.K
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since being sold by Huawei, Honor has released the Honor Magic4 Pro phone globally, and it really impressed in our review
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Honor is talking up the camera on the back of the Honor 70
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Honor 70 doesn’t share a family resemblance with the Magic4 Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Honor has never released a tablet internationally before, so this is a first for the brand

            <p>
                Like the Honor 70, the Pad 8 uses Honor’s Magic UI 6.1 software built over Android 12, with the added benefit of multitasking for four apps

                Since that announcement, Xbox fans and commentators from across the gaming sphere have wondered if Microsoft would follow suit with the Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Microsoft has won a lot of ground in the current console generation by focusing on value via Xbox Game Pass, and the more affordable Xbox Series S, which targets 1080p while bringing next-gen speeds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement to Windows Central, a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that there are no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X or the Xbox Series S, reiterating that they will remain at their baseline RRPs in various currencies, including USD, GBP, and EUR
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our Xbox Series S suggested retail price remains at $299 (£250, €300) the Xbox Series X is $499 (£450, €500).” While this isn’t a hard guarantee that we will never see a price hike for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles, it’s certainly an encouraging sign that Microsoft has no intentions to do so in the short term

                A little under three months after it was first announced in China, Honor has launched its midrange Honor 70 smartphone in the UK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Compared to last year’s Honor 50, the Honor 70’s camera specs are a lot better balanced this time around
            </p>
            
            <p>
                (An Honor 60 was announced in China in December but never saw a global release.) Rather than pairing an incredibly high-resolution 108-megapixel camera with three extra sensors totaling just 12-megapixels in resolution between them, the Honor 70 balances a 54-megapixel main sensor with a 50-megapixel ultrawide (which also handles macro shots) and a 2-megapixel depth sensor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Otherwise, the Honor 70 has a similar overall design to the Honor 50
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alongside its new smartphone, Honor is also announcing the Pad 8 tablet, which Gizmochina reports that it launched as the Honor Tablet 8 in China last month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’ll cost £270 in the UK and will be available direct from Honor tomorrow or on September 2nd from Amazon

                As part of its first-anniversary celebration, Pokemon UNITE has revealed details on the newest Pokemon that will be joining the fray next month, as well as some new details on the latest events and features players can be expected in September
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The biggest piece of news is that the Pokemon UNITE will be adding the Mythical Pokemon Mew to its roster on September 2, 2022, the first of three new Pokemon previously teased to be coming to the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Mythical Pokemon Mew will be the first of the three new fighters added to Pokemon UNITE on September 2, and as seen in the newest trailer, players will need to collect mural fragments in order to unlock Mew’s Unite license
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mew will have more learnable moves than any other Pokemon in Pokemon UNITE, as well as the ability to forget and re-learn moves throughout the battle
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finally, a new event called the Legacy Trainer Showdown will also be added for a limited time to Pokemon UNITE on September 9
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In it, players will be able to do battle against iconic Pokemon trainers from across the series, including Leon, Korrina, Raihan, and Leaf, who will be using their signature Pokemon

                Loh Kean Yew of Singapore plays a shot against Kunlavut Vitidsarn of Thailand during a badminton game of the men's singles quarterfinal in the BWF World Championships in Tokyo Friday, Aug

            <p>
                "I just tried my best to fight for every point and that was all that matters." The 21-year-old Vitidsarn is a three-time junior world champion who is seen as one of world badminton's best young players

            <p>
                Marin is feeling her way back into competition after suffering a horror knee injury last year that forced her to miss the Tokyo Olympics and kept her out of action for a year

            <p>
                She returned to the court in May this year but current world number one Yamaguchi was too strong in their world championships quarter-final in Tokyo, advancing with a 21-17, 21-17 win
            </p>
            
            <p>
                China's Chen, who won gold last year in Tokyo, beat Canada's Michelle Li 21-18, 21-17, while Taiwan's Tai advanced with a 21-16, 21-9 win over Thailand's Busanan Ongbamrungphan

                To do this, press the “three dots” icon that is usually located on the top right corner of a post and then select QR Code

            <p>
                Doing so will bring up a customisation pop-up which lets you change the colour of the code before saving it onto your device’s camera roll

                Instagram has rolled out a new feature that allows you to now share individual content via QR codes

                To do this, press the “three dots” icon that is usually located on the top right corner of a post and then select QR Code

                This is because the brand never released a OnePlus 10, only a 10 Pro, so this should technically sit below the Pro variant despite its housing of a more powerful chip

                I haven’t used a OnePlus since the 3T, so to me, this phone felt more like a generic, but still powerful, mobile device rather than a quirky and unique flagship killer — the type of phone the brand was initially famous for

                HP isn’t the first company to debut a monitor with an IPS Black panel, a technology that doubles the contrast ratio of IPS to provide richer contrast and darker blacks

                But OLED aside, and within the realm of tech that’s more commonly used in PC monitors, IPS Black seems to push well ahead of both VA and TN in terms of color accuracy and contrast ratio

                Dell’s 32-inch IPS Black monitor currently costs $859.99 (it seems to be on sale, as it’s normally priced at $1,149.99), but HP hasn’t yet shared a price for this monitor

                It may sound a bit too early for Galaxy S23 Ultra leaks but this one comes from a pretty reliable source, Ice Universe

                The Steelrising beta went live just a few minutes ago, and will continue to be available all the way until September 7, one day before the full game's worldwide release

                Beta progress does not carry over to the full game, however, so think of it as more of a demo that'll help you get familiar with the game's combat and setting

                Oppo has completed the Reno 8 series of phones in Malaysia with the launch of the Reno 8 Z today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reno 8 Z is available in just one variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, priced at RM1,799
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s a good RM600 cheaper than the standard Reno 8
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Underneath the rejigged design the Reno 8 Z is practically identical to the Reno 7 Z
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reno 8 Z also ships with Android 12, skinned with ColorOS 12.1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the outside, the Reno 8 Z shares the Reno 8 design language, with the camera section expanded to the edges of the device

                Oppo has completed the Reno 8 series of phones in Malaysia with the launch of the Reno 8 Z today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reno 8 Z is available in just one variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, priced at RM1,799
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s a good RM600 cheaper than the standard Reno 8
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Underneath the rejigged design the Reno 8 Z is practically identical to the Reno 7 Z
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reno 8 Z also ships with Android 12, skinned with ColorOS 12.1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the outside, the Reno 8 Z shares the Reno 8 design language, with the camera section expanded to the edges of the device

                According to Oppo, the device retains its emphasis on photography, particularly in taking portraits, maintaining the Bokeh Flare Portrait feature present in previous Oppo devices that blurs the background while boosting the bokeh light spots to highlight the subject
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Oppo Enco Buds2 are priced at RM129 and come in Midnight and Moonlight colour options

            <p>
                The device will be available in two colour variants – Dawnlight Gold and Starlight Black – while featuring the company's Integrated Oppo Glow, a fingerprint resistant coating which also gives the device's backplate a shimmering appearance

            <p>
                Those who purchase the device at Oppo's Portrait Carnival at the Sunway Velocity Mall before Aug 31 will also be eligible for a free pair of TWS earbuds (worth RM109), hotel vouchers (RM250), and a powerbank (RM79)
            </p>

                Oppo also showed off their Enco Buds2, which like the Reno8 Z 5G will be available from Aug 26, which the company claims boasts a seven-hour battery life, with a total of 28 hours worth of charge stored in the charging case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both the Reno8 Z 5G and Enco Buds2 will be available at My Oppo Spaces, Oppo Brand Stores, Oppo Official Online Stores, Oppo Telco partners, Oppo ecommerce partners, and Oppo chain-store partners

            <p>
                On Tuesday, Najib became the first former prime minister in the country's history to be sent to prison after the Federal Court upheld the High Court's conviction and sentence

                On July 28, 2020, the Kuala Lumpur High Court sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and a total fine of RM210mil after being found guilty of seven charges of criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of position in the RM42mil SRC International case

            </p>
            
            <p>
                With many smartphone manufacturers already starting the Android 13 beta program for their devices, Nothing CEO Carl Pei announced that the Phone 1 will get Android 13 beta sometime by the end of the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pei made the statement after Nothing was facing criticism that the final update would only arrive in 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Running on Android 12 out of the box, Carl Pei said they are not in a rush to update the Phone 1 ‘at the expense of user experience.’  Nothing OS based on Android 13 will be getting a stable release in early 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This also applies to Nothing OS based on Android 13 where we aim to ship a beta version by the end of the year, with a full release in early 2023

                The phone has a fingerprint sensor on the side and can charge via USB-C. As of now, the smartphone is not available on the T-Mobile website, but there are placeholders for it, so it should only be a matter of time

            <p>
                The FreeBuds Pro 2 is also certified with the HWA and Hi-Res Audio Wireless Certification and of course, you can expect Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on a 4-Mic Call Noise Cancellation system and Huawei's deep neural network (DNN) noise cancellation algorithm, it can accurately capture voices with noise cancellation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the other hand, the FreeBuds Pro 2 features an Intelligent Dynamic ANC 2.0 that can identify the environment and choose a suitable noise cancelling mode that eliminates noise.  The FreeBuds Pro 2 is compatible with all Huawei devices, selected smartphones, tablets, PC, smartwatches, Android and Windows systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can now visit the Huawei Official Website, Huawei Official Store on Shopee or Huawei Flagship Store on Lazada and get your hands on the Freebuds Pro 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But that's not the only product they launched, there's also the new Huawei Freebuds 3 wireless headset and the Huawei Watch GT 2 as well.

                If they can pay, they pay fine and they therefore avoid the ‘in default imprisonment’,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because the extra five-year jail time starts at the end of Najib’s current jail sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So when someone is given an imprisonment and fine, the failure to pay the fine will result in imprisonment that is over and above the existing prison sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He has time from the current 12-year sentence to pay, and by the end of it, he doesn’t pay the RM210 million, the five-year sentence will begin,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If a prisoner is sentenced to jail for more than six years (such as Najib’s 12 years) AND a fine, he has to pay the fine before the end of the existing jail term (before the end of 12 years in Najib’s case) to avoid spending even more time in jail, Salim confirmed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if remission of sentence happens while the 12-year sentence is still being served midway by Najib, for example, he would have to pay the fine “before he ends the entire sentencing after remission”, Salim said

                If they can pay, they pay fine and they therefore avoid the ‘in default imprisonment’,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is because the extra five-year jail time starts at the end of Najib’s current jail sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So when someone is given an imprisonment and fine, the failure to pay the fine will result in imprisonment that is over and above the existing prison sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He has time from the current 12-year sentence to pay, and by the end of it, he doesn’t pay the RM210 million, the five-year sentence will begin,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If a prisoner is sentenced to jail for more than six years (such as Najib’s 12 years) AND a fine, he has to pay the fine before the end of the existing jail term (before the end of 12 years in Najib’s case) to avoid spending even more time in jail, Salim confirmed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if remission of sentence happens while the 12-year sentence is still being served midway by Najib, for example, he would have to pay the fine “before he ends the entire sentencing after remission”, Salim said

                It seems Valve felt that way, too, because it’s now beta testing a new version of the app that looks dramatically different and, if you ask me, dramatically better
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, the app now has a navigation bar on the bottom of the screen where you can navigate to things like the store, your news feed, and the Steam Guard section

                But the app doesn’t just have a refreshed coat of paint; it’s built on a “new framework” and has some additional features

            <p>
                My personal favorite? You can now scan a QR code from the Steam Guard section to sign into your Steam account, like what you might be familiar with from Discord’s mobile app
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Valve also says the new Steam app has “ smarter notifications, an improved Library, and multi account support,” and you’ll still be able to do things like browse the store and confirm any trades

                Valve is currently beta testing the app on iOS and Android, so it isn’t widely available just yet

            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Although voters have a chance to boot out self-serving politicians in the 15th general election (GE15), they have also been reminded that no politician is above the law
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said such politicians will only cause chaos and create political instability, which would hurt the country and create a negative impression of the nation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Today, voters can see the national damage that the self-serving political class have caused through corruption and abuse of power
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Corruption has not only cost the country billions of ringgit but also created a bad impression among foreign investors and leaders
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “If the people fail to vote in leaders with integrity, the country will continue to go down the drain.” Jeniri said there is a need for the Political Funding Bill to be passed to address corruption as politicians can always claim the money they received was for political funding, although it went into their own pockets

                Apple today released a new update for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple first introduced in March 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download

                XDA’s official marketplace for buying and selling tech Premium videos Google has announced that Google Play Games beta on Windows is available in a couple more countries starting today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The service is still in beta, but Google has also made some improvements to make Play Games more accessible on Windows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finally, Google has also lowered the storage requirements, so you should be able to use Google Play Games with just 10GB of free internal storage, as opposed to the 20GB that were required previously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As Google continues to work towards a full release of Google Play Games on Windows, this will ensure many more people are able to play these games on their PC, in addition to their phones
            </p>

                Samsung didn’t specifically mention if it’s compatible with the PlayStation 5 (which can accept third-party SSDs if they are fast enough), but the older Samsung 980 Pro worked with the PS5, so it’s a safe bet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s up to 55% faster than the 980 Pro, which was released in 2020
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The drive is also up to 50% more power efficient than the 980 Pro

            <p>
                Samsung will sell the drive with and without a heatsink — the latter option has RGB lights, because do you really have a gaming PC if you don’t have RGB everywhere? The new drive once again places Samsung near (or at) the lead in NVMe SSDs, but there’s still plenty of competition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pricing for the Samsung 990 Pro and 990 Pro with Heatsink will be $179 for the 1 TB model, and $309 for 2 TB, with both arriving in stores around October 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, if you know you’ll benefit from faster speeds (like gaming at higher quality settings), the 990 Pro is promising

                On Monday, Apple expanded its DIY repair program to include MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops equipped with M1 chips (including the Pro and Max)

            <p>
                The repair manual for replacing the 14-inch MacBook Pro’s battery, for example, is a whole 162 pages long
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A user needs to replace the entire top case and keyboard in order to replace the battery, because Apple does not currently sell replacement batteries on their own for the 14-inch model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The “top case with battery” part that you’ll need to purchase for the 2020 and 2021 MacBook Pro models is not cheap — after rooting around Apple’s store, Verge editor Sean Hollister found that you can expect to pay well upwards of $400 for the top case with battery after the repair credit

                @technacity YouTube Music is significantly redesigning its Library tab on Android with a focus on making it faster to start playing content.
            </p>

                The redesign switches to a list view that immediately shows content instead of requiring users to first select a page

                As such, you can permanently have the Library tab always show media stored offline

                We’re seeing this YouTube Music Library redesign widely rolled out today on Android phones and now tablets, but not iOS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the app’s biggest UI refresh in quite a while as the playlist and album page redesigns are still only on Android tablets.

                @ChaosRomero Wordle is the word game we’ve all come to know and has been making waves since its release in 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since the game was acquired by New York Times, the puzzle game has been gaining improvements, one of which is the addition of Wordle to the New York Times Crossword app.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To add to that, Wordle is taking on a new upgrade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                New York Times has announced that Wordle will be joining other games in the New York Times Crossword app on Android and iOS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Wordle, you’ll just need to sign up for a free NYT account, which you can do through Google for quick and easy access.

            <p>
                Since the game was acquired by New York Times, the puzzle game has been gaining improvements, one of which is the addition of Wordle to the New York Times Crossword app.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To add to that, Wordle is taking on a new upgrade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                New York Times has announced that Wordle will be joining other games in the New York Times Crossword app on Android and iOS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Wordle, you’ll just need to sign up for a free NYT account, which you can do through Google for quick and easy access.

                The Samsung 990 Pro SSD has random read speeds up to 1,400K IOPS, while write speeds go up to 1,550K IOPS

                Man United take on Southampton at the St Mary’s Stadium in gameweek four of the Premier League and they go into this game on the back of a fantastic win against Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Southampton played a midweek EFL Cup tie against Cambridge United and in that game, several of the first-team regulars played the full 90 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This unwanted fixture means the home side will have one less day to rest and this could be a key factor if Man United maintain the same intensity as they did against Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Surprisingly, Man United haven’t been able to beat Southampton in their last two meetings but if they can replicate their form from Monday then Ten Hag’s side should be picking up an easy win
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Casemiro was unveiled to the Old Trafford crowd on Monday and Erik ten Hag will waste no time in bringing him into the side
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Man United managed to play a much more aggressive game without Ronaldo in the side and we don’t think the manager will be willing to lose this advantage

                Casemiro was unveiled to the Old Trafford crowd on Monday and Erik ten Hag will waste no time in bringing him into the side

                Man United managed to play a much more aggressive game without Ronaldo in the side and we don’t think the manager will be willing to lose this advantage

                Several Lowyat.NET’s Instagram followers noted that they eventually managed to purchase the card by being persistent enough to try again and again

            <p>
                If you are tired of the experience that you faced on the app today, what you can do is check out this list of petrol stations that are authorised to sell the card, find the one that is nearest to your location, and give them a call to check in-premise availability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Wiser has a rather interesting theory that TNG apparently releases the card into its e-wallet app every two weeks

                “The government’s thirst for extra revenue can be met with the 15% global tax rate on MNEs,” the former finance minister said, adding that this would be enough to offset gains expected from the 10% online sales tax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He noted that the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN) had said in October last year that 136 countries had agreed to impose a minimum tax rate of 15% to certain MNEs from 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tax rate of 15% would reallocate profits of more than US$125 billion from about 100 of the world’s largest and most profitable MNEs to all 136 countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia, having agreed in principle to the 15% minimum tax, will be one of those countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lim said there were about 3,000 MNEs under the LHDN multinational tax branch, which would garner “hundreds of millions in extra revenue” when the global tax rate is imposed from Jan 1

                Samsung has announced a new version of its flagship PCIe SSD, dubbed the 990 Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not only does the PCIe 4.0 M.2 storage device get even closer to being as fast as it can theoretically be, but there’s also the option of getting it with a heatsink that comes complete with RGB lighting (though, if you get that version to upgrade a PlayStation 5, which requires add-on SSDs to have a heatsink, those lights will likely get lost behind a layer of textured plastic)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Impressive as it is, the performance jump isn’t anywhere near what we saw from the 970 Pro to the 980 Pro when Samsung upgraded from PCIe 3.0 to 4.0
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Samsung didn’t immediately answer The Verge’s question on how it was able to squeeze even more speed out of its SSDs without upgrading to a newer version of PCIe, but its press release does mention that the 990 Pro has a “newly designed controller” handling the task of actually reading and writing bits to and from the NAND flash chips
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s even true if you’re looking to upgrade the somewhat picky PS5; Samsung sells a version of the 980 with the required heatsink

            <p>

                He's not at his best

            <p>
                Prannoy beats Momota! HS Prannoy has utterly dominated Kento Momota, winning against the home contender 21-17, 21-16
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is HS Prannoy's 1st win over Kento Momota in 9 matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Momota can't catch a break ! And then there's Prannoy's backhand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not quite a game style, Prannoy fancies

                With The Last of Us Part 2 being removed from PlayStation Now as part of the January 2022 lineup refresh, there has been a significant hole in the streaming service’s catalog for many months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While its return would be cool, it’d be better to see the game headline the PS Plus September 2022 selection
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Last of Us Part 1 releases on September 2, so having TLOU Part 2 made available on September 6 would no doubt entice newcomers to grab the pair
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mass Effect Legendary Edition has recently been featured in several free game promotions on other platforms, so it wouldn’t be a surprise to see it also making an appearance in the PS Plus September 2022 lineup

            <p>
                The August 2022 free update, update 1.20, will be bringing in another muscle car, another Porsche, and surprisingly an F1 car

            <p>
                Gran Turismo Sport previously had the 2017 Mercedes-AMG F1 car, though that didn’t make it to GT7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At least now the game has its token licensed F1 car in its roster of cars

                Another month, another set of three cars being added to Gran Turismo 7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The August 2022 free update, update 1.20, will be bringing in another muscle car, another Porsche, and surprisingly an F1 car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And it’s not just an F1 car
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gran Turismo Sport previously had the 2017 Mercedes-AMG F1 car, though that didn’t make it to GT7
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At least now the game has its token licensed F1 car in its roster of cars

                The 23-year-old requires just one more grandmaster norm title to attain the grandmaster title — a feat he aims to achieve within the next two or three years

            <p>
                The 23-year-old explained that it would become more difficult to attain the title as chess players mature into working adults, leaving them less time to improve on their game

                The Nothing Phone (1) is probably one of the most talked about mid-range smartphones of the year and its biggest feature is the unique LED lights at the rear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the recent release of Android 13 for Google Pixel devices, Nothing co-founder and CEO Carl Pei was asked if there’s any official announcement on Android 13 for the Nothing Phone (1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That gave the impression that Nothing is taking its own time to deliver the latest Android operating system for its maiden smartphone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This also applies to Nothing OS based on Android 13 where we aim to ship a beta version by the end of the year, with a full release in early 2023

                The Nothing Phone (1) is probably one of the most talked about mid-range smartphones of the year and its biggest feature is the unique LED lights at the rear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Following the recent release of Android 13 for Google Pixel devices, Nothing co-founder and CEO Carl Pei was asked if there’s any official announcement on Android 13 for the Nothing Phone (1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That gave the impression that Nothing is taking its own time to deliver the latest Android operating system for its maiden smartphone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This also applies to Nothing OS based on Android 13 where we aim to ship a beta version by the end of the year, with a full release in early 2023

                The DualSense Edge Wireless Controller is the latest hardware from Sony, and it's, well… ugly

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Targeted at an elite gamer who needs to adjust the controller to their needs the DualSense Edge is pure function over form
            </p>

                You can watch a video of the new DualSense Edge below to see for yourself

            <p>
                I'm being a little harsh on Sony's entry into the pro gamer space for PS5; considering you can break the DualSense Edge down and adjust it to how you need it to work, it does remain a sleek controller but with a new industrial, well… edge

                This gaming hub provides quick and easy access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, and Nvidia GeForce Now game streaming services
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Samsung’s Gaming Hub is built directly into all four of these models for quick access to game streaming services, but there’s also a new Game Bar tool that lets PC gamers view gaming settings and modify response times, screen ratios, and game modes easily
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can even use these monitors without a PC, thanks to Samsung’s Smart Platform integration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Samsung lets G70B and G65B owners wirelessly connect to PCs or Macs, mirror an iPhone or iPad screen using Apple AirPlay 2, or even use Samsung DeX — one of the closest things we have to using our phones as PCs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Samsung hasn’t released full specs, release dates, or pricing for the Odyssey G70B and G65B yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These new models “will be available globally from Q4,” says Samsung

                Apple will launch a high-end Apple Watch Series 8 "Pro" model with an all-new design this year, according to recent reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gurman said that this year's high-end Apple Watch model will be "a good bit bigger" than the current Apple Watch models owing to a five to seven percent larger display, so much so that "it might only appeal to a subset of customers." The high-end Apple Watch will reportedly feature the first new design since the launch of the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gurman recently reported that Apple is planning to host an event on Wednesday, September 7 to unveil new iPhone and Apple Watch models

                Apple will launch a high-end Apple Watch Series 8 "Pro" model with an all-new design this year, according to recent reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gurman said that this year's high-end Apple Watch model will be "a good bit bigger" than the current Apple Watch models owing to a five to seven percent larger display, so much so that "it might only appeal to a subset of customers." The high-end Apple Watch will reportedly feature the first new design since the launch of the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2018
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gurman recently reported that Apple is planning to host an event on Wednesday, September 7 to unveil new iPhone and Apple Watch models

            <p>
                The successor to the Galaxy A03, it retains some of the same aesthetics from the smartphone but with some refinements and a specs bump.  According to Samsung’s press release, the Galaxy A04 is powered by an unnamed octa-core processor under the hood which is believed to be the company’s own Exynos 850 SoC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s no 5G connectivity, unfortunately, whereby the Galaxy A04 only supports 4G
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, Samsung has yet to reveal the price of the device or its availability
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given the specs of the device, we expect it to be priced well below RM1000 and should be a competitive offering in the affordable smartphone segment.  What do you guys think?

            <p>
                The score of 1,146,594 for the phone with model number ASUS_AI2203_D may be unofficial and an outlier in AnTuTu terms, but it is still 2-3% more than the very same ROG Phone 6 Pro, powered by a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1
            </p>

                Asus is still staying silent on any new ROG phone launches but we expect the 6D to arrive soon, as the device was already certified at 3C with 65W fast charging

                Earlier this month, we reported that iPadOS 16 may potentially be delayed and not be released together with iOS 16
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, Apple themselves have come out with a statement to confirm the matter, saying that iPadOS 16 won’t be getting a public release until after iOS 16 has been rolled out to supported iPhones.  Previously, reliable tipster Mark Gurman claimed that for the first time in years, Apple will not be releasing the iPadOS update in September or at the same time as the iOS update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Like many of Gurman’s predictions, the claim turns out to be true as today, Apple told TechCrunch that iPadOS 16 will indeed be delayed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another peculiar thing is that Apple will be releasing an update directly to iPadOS 16.1 instead of iPadOS 16
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company released iPadOS 16.1 beta to enrolled developers earlier today

                Bandai Namco Entertainment Asia has just released a new gameplay trailer for Park Beyond which is set to be released in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X & S and PC
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The trailer shows off characters from the game’s campaign who are busy making their craziest ideas a reality and giving more insight into modular building with extensive customisation to create a fully personalised park
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Developed by studio Limbic Entertainment, Park Beyond is a brand-new take on theme park management simulation games and as a visionary architect, players will take on the fantastic task of building and managing every detail of their own amusement park with a twist
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While creating rides for their parks, players will soon discover there is no such thing as impossible in Park Beyond with the game’s Impossification feature, which is a concept where technology, money and gravity are no insurmountable obstacles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Park Beyond will feature thousands of assets that are split into various themes such as a Western theme, a DaVinci theme, Candyville and others which let players design entire themed districts in their park or mix and match any elements for a close to infinite number of possibilities
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Kang Tae Oh boasts his masculine beauty in a new pictorial with GQ Korea! In the pictorial, Kang Tae Oh draws attention with his nonchalant expressions and sexy atmosphere as opposed to the soft image he showed in “Extraordinary Attorney Woo.” “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” is a drama which tells the story of Woo Young Woo (Park Eun Bin), a young lawyer on the autism spectrum who joins a major law firm

                Fitbit's launch event teaser Fitbit has teased a launch event due to take place today, on August 24 at 6am PT
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fitbit wrote “be sure to check back tomorrow at 6am PT” in response to a user who asked “when can I get the Fitbit Sense 2” and “we hear you” to another fan who commented that they want a new Fitbit with a physical button
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So is that it? Fitbit is to announce a Sense 2 watch at 6am PT, and it will have a physical button? To me the teaser image seems to show a watch with a capacitive button, just like the original Sense — because it looks more concave than convex
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The biggest news here, though, is that the Fitbit Sense 2 is likely to be the first Fitbit watch powered by WearOS, something Fitbit has talked about ever since it was acquired by Google in early 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its timing means the Fitbit Sense 2 will arrive long before the Pixel Watch, which is expected in October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also a chance Fitbit will announce not one but two new lines today, with the Fitbit Versa 4
            </p>

                So is that it? Fitbit is to announce a Sense 2 watch at 6am PT, and it will have a physical button? To me the teaser image seems to show a watch with a capacitive button, just like the original Sense — because it looks more concave than convex
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The biggest news here, though, is that the Fitbit Sense 2 is likely to be the first Fitbit watch powered by WearOS, something Fitbit has talked about ever since it was acquired by Google in early 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Its timing means the Fitbit Sense 2 will arrive long before the Pixel Watch, which is expected in October
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also a chance Fitbit will announce not one but two new lines today, with the Fitbit Versa 4

                Late last year, Apple announced its Self Service Repair program that would give customers access to parts, tools, and detailed repair manuals for Apple products
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Apple has just updated its Self Service Repair program with parts and repair manuals for all M1 MacBook models including the 13-inch MacBook Air, and the 13, 14, and 16-inch MacBook Pro models

                The realme Watch 3 was unveiled by the company last month with a bigger display and significantly cut-down battery life
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To recap, the smartwatch sports a 1.8-inch LCD display with a peak brightness of 500 nits, making it about 35% larger than the Watch 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The software also provides the Watch 3 with over 100 watch faces to choose from
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The highlight of the watch is Bluetooth calling, powered a Dual-Mode Bluetooth chip with supports both the regular standard and Bluetooth Low Energy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The battery life of the device is a bit odd, because despite having slightly bigger 340mAh battery compared to its predecessor’s 315mAh capacity, it only has a seven-day battery life, almost half of the Watch 2’s 12-day usage claim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The realme Watch 3 comes in black and grey options on Shopee with a price tag of RM259

            <p>
                The realme Watch 3 was unveiled by the company last month with a bigger display and significantly cut-down battery life
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To recap, the smartwatch sports a 1.8-inch LCD display with a peak brightness of 500 nits, making it about 35% larger than the Watch 2
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The software also provides the Watch 3 with over 100 watch faces to choose from
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The highlight of the watch is Bluetooth calling, powered a Dual-Mode Bluetooth chip with supports both the regular standard and Bluetooth Low Energy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The battery life of the device is a bit odd, because despite having slightly bigger 340mAh battery compared to its predecessor’s 315mAh capacity, it only has a seven-day battery life, almost half of the Watch 2’s 12-day usage claim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The realme Watch 3 comes in black and grey options on Shopee with a price tag of RM259

                The WRX is offered in a total of nine colours, including Ceramic White, Crystal White Pearl, Ice Silver Metallic, Magnetite Grey Metallic, Crystal Black Silica, Sapphire Blue Pearl, World Rally Blue Pearl, Solar Orange Pearl and Ignition Red

                Known as the WRX Sportswagon in Australia and the WRX GT Wagon in New Zealand, the more practical offering only comes with a CVT and is actually priced less than the WRX at 2.959 million baht (RM367,012)

                Nazri and MIC have been at odds since last week, when the party announced its intention to run for 12 parliamentary seats in GE15
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nazri likened MIC to beggars and attributed the party’s victories in the Melaka and Johor state elections to Umno’s goodwill

            <p>
                “At the end of the day, MIC will compromise on any decision made by Umno.” He told FMT he believed MIC wanted to contest in Sungai Siput for “nostalgic” reasons, but added that Umno was more likely to consider the demographics of the constituency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The seat was occupied by MIC president VT Sambanthan from 1959 to 1974 and then by the next party chief, S Samy Vellu, until 2008, when he lost it to Dr Michael Jeyakumar of Parti Sosialis Malaysia

                “At the end of the day, MIC will compromise on any decision made by Umno.” He told FMT he believed MIC wanted to contest in Sungai Siput for “nostalgic” reasons, but added that Umno was more likely to consider the demographics of the constituency

                The seat was occupied by MIC president VT Sambanthan from 1959 to 1974 and then by the next party chief, S Samy Vellu, until 2008, when he lost it to Dr Michael Jeyakumar of Parti Sosialis Malaysia

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 24 — Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak could write to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah in a bid for clemency over his conviction in the SRC International Sdn Bhd corruption case, but he will have to serve time first, former attorney-general (AG) Tan Sri Abu Talib Othman reportedly said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abu Talib was a prosecutor in the late 1970s when the late former Selangor chief minister Datuk Harun Idris was convicted for corruption and the AG in 1982 when the late former culture, youth and sports minister Datuk Mokhtar Hashim was convicted for the murder of Datuk Mohamad Taha Talib, the then-speaker of Negri Sembilan legislative assembly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He also reportedly said that the Agong must act on advice despite the power of pardon being vested in him and that the decisions of any pardons board are currently beyond review by courts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The royal pardon falls under Article 42(1) of the Federal Constitution, which gives the Agong or Sultan the powers to grant a pardon or reprieve to a convict, wiping clean any legal punishments to provide a "clean slate”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Najib failed in his final appeal against the High Court's guilty conviction, which saw the Federal Court ordering him to serve his 12-year sentence with immediate effect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat said that the findings of the High Court on the defence were correct and that the learned trial judge had undertaken a thorough analysis of the evidence produced by the defence, correctly evaluating all the evidence led in relation to the defence and did not believe the defence narrative

                The only hope for their only child, Zayn Nabeel Abdat, is a S$3 million (RM13.5 million) medication called Zolgensma — a one-time treatment dubbed the world’s most expensive drug

                Even if they can get their child to receive the Zolgensma therapy, Nabeel and Ms Syahirah know that Zayn will have to go through physiotherapy and other treatments after that

                The only hope for their only child, Zayn Nabeel Abdat, is a S$3 million (RM13.5 million) medication called Zolgensma — a one-time treatment dubbed the world’s most expensive drug
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zayn did not test positive for Covid-19
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Nabeel who stayed with Zayn in the ward
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even if they can get their child to receive the Zolgensma therapy, Nabeel and Ms Syahirah know that Zayn will have to go through physiotherapy and other treatments after that
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We hope Zayn can grow up as healthy as possible..
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Since the Federal Court is the highest court in Malaysia and Najib had failed to overturn the previous decisions in the Court of Appeal and High Court which found him guilty in the SRC case, that was his final appeal
            </p>

                He explained that it would be a “must” for Najib to attend criminal cases’ proceedings in court, while he would only have to attend court proceedings for civil cases “if there’s a need”

            <p>
                Vivekananda explained that only when the judge in a civil case sees it necessary for a prisoner to attend, such as in an application for evidence in court, a court order to produce the prisoner in court can then be issued for the person to attend

            <p>
                According to the post, the exploit can allow a malicious app to appear as an app store so that it can bypass Android 13's new security measures
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now if you download an app from outside of an official app store, it will be harder for that app to access your contacts to spread spam or appear over other apps
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All apps downloaded from the Play Store or third-party app stores like F-Droid, or the Amazon App Store are exempt from this restriction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Allowing apps downloaded from official app stores to access accessibility services in Android 13 makes sense as, just like Google does on the Play Store, other official stores screen new apps to ensure they aren’t malicious by carefully checking their code
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First things first, you should never sideload apps on your Android smartphone and should instead download them from official app stores

                The former prime minister, who will be serving a 12-year sentence after the apex court affirmed his conviction, said that the political world and public service had its pros and cons

                He said he was also unable to join his family for dinner as he had to attend meetings

                “A journey that was joyous with your presence but unfortunately I overlooked and could not always be there for you,” he said in the letter addressed to “my family, my love” which was posted on his Facebook account
            </p>

                The letter had apparently been left on his table

                On July 28, 2020, Najib was convicted on all seven charges for abuse of power, misappropriation and money laundering involving RM42 million of funds belonging to SRC International

                Earlier today, Najib filed an application to recuse Tengku Maimun from hearing the appeal on grounds that Zamani had “negative sentiments” towards his leadership, which the latter had expressed in a Facebook post in the aftermath of the 14th general election

            <p>
                In the post, Zamani spoke about the fall of the Barisan Nasional government on May 9, 2018, and that he was “happy because Najib had been dethroned”

                In my view, that does not mean that the legal threshold for bias and recusal has been met
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [5] The Federal Court, in Public Prosecutor v Tengku Adnan bin Tengku Mansor [2020] 5 MLJ 220, has recently affirmed that in order to recuse a judge the test is the ‘real danger of bias test’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [6] The question is whether the grounds of the application to recuse successfully raise a real danger of bias
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This case stands for the proposition that the views of a spouse of a judge cannot in itself be used as a ground for recusal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I do not see how this discloses any fear or real danger of bias sufficient to recuse me
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [15] Finally, the fact that certain other judges recused themselves in cases involving the appellant in this case does not itself present a reason for me to recuse myself in this case

                In my view, that does not mean that the legal threshold for bias and recusal has been met
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [5] The Federal Court, in Public Prosecutor v Tengku Adnan bin Tengku Mansor [2020] 5 MLJ 220, has recently affirmed that in order to recuse a judge the test is the ‘real danger of bias test’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [6] The question is whether the grounds of the application to recuse successfully raise a real danger of bias
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This case stands for the proposition that the views of a spouse of a judge cannot in itself be used as a ground for recusal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I do not see how this discloses any fear or real danger of bias sufficient to recuse me
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [15] Finally, the fact that certain other judges recused themselves in cases involving the appellant in this case does not itself present a reason for me to recuse myself in this case
            </p>

                Rafizi said there was “enough evidence” to back his claim that the woman, Zainab Mohd Salleh, was Abd Latiff Ahmad’s wife

            <p>
                The evidence, he said, could be found in a recently declassified audit report by Boustead Heavy Industries Corp naming Zainab as Latiff’s wife as well as the pair’s connection to offshore companies linked to the project

            <p>
                He also said the schemes to misappropriate LCS funds using companies allegedly linked to Latiff, who was the then deputy defence minister, was no coincidence

                The main opposition party, and nearly two-thirds of Thais questioned in an opinion poll, believe Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who took power in a 2014 coup, should step down by August 24 because his time as junta chief counts towards his term

                If the duo leave, the Blaugrana will be left short-handed in the centre-forward department even though Xavi can use both Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres can deputise for Robert Lewandowski

            <p>
                So, there is a possibility that Barcelona might look to secure a low-cost signing in the attacking department to replace the departing duo, who scored 26 goals between them in the last season

            <p>
                And, as per SPORT, manager Xavi Hernandez would ideally prefer a player like Luuk de Jong, who was on loan at Barcelona last season

            <p>
                The Dutchman had signed from Sevilla on the transfer deadline day of the last summer as a replacement for Antoine Griezmann but struggled to make much of an impact upon arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As per the report, Xavi would prefer a player like de Jong, who would accept being a substitute, continue training professionally and offer quality from the bench and deliver goals when needed, if both Depay and Aubameyang left
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcelona have reportedly been offered a chance to sign Andrea Belotti, Adnan Januzaj and Edinson Cavani

                So, there is a possibility that Barcelona might look to secure a low-cost signing in the attacking department to replace the departing duo, who scored 26 goals between them in the last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And, as per SPORT, manager Xavi Hernandez would ideally prefer a player like Luuk de Jong, who was on loan at Barcelona last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Dutchman had signed from Sevilla on the transfer deadline day of the last summer as a replacement for Antoine Griezmann but struggled to make much of an impact upon arrival
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As per the report, Xavi would prefer a player like de Jong, who would accept being a substitute, continue training professionally and offer quality from the bench and deliver goals when needed, if both Depay and Aubameyang left
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcelona have reportedly been offered a chance to sign Andrea Belotti, Adnan Januzaj and Edinson Cavani

                Liwan, who is also state deputy utility and telecommunication minister, castigated Hadi for his recent disparaging remarks describing non-Muslims and non-Bumiputera as being the “roots of corruption” in the country

                About Us Advertise IPOH, Aug 23 — Barisan Nasional (BN) is aiming to win 16 parliamentary seats in Perak in order to help the coalition form the government at the federal level in the 15th general election (GE15), said BN deputy chairman Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan

            <p>
                If we work hard this might not be impossible to win

            <p>
                If we get all nine seats and defend the 27 seats, we can acquire a stable majority to form the state government in Perak,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad also urged BN members to set aside misunderstandings and personal interests as the priority right now is to win the election and form the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No point we enter the election if we are not ready, since an election is like a war

                About Us Advertise IPOH, Aug 23 — Barisan Nasional (BN) is aiming to win 16 parliamentary seats in Perak in order to help the coalition form the government at the federal level in the 15th general election (GE15), said BN deputy chairman Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If we work hard this might not be impossible to win
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If we get all nine seats and defend the 27 seats, we can acquire a stable majority to form the state government in Perak,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohamad also urged BN members to set aside misunderstandings and personal interests as the priority right now is to win the election and form the government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                No point we enter the election if we are not ready, since an election is like a war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We don’t have any other choice than to win

                Manchester United ran 19km more against Liverpool than in the poor 4-0 defeat to Brentford United had a much higher success rate than Liverpool in duels, as they made 11 more tackles It wasn't only about the distance United covered, they made a huge total of 155 sprints compared to the 65 that they made against the Bees.  The high-pressing style of play led to plenty more interceptions as they had 12, double Jurgen Klopp's side total of six during the match
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Those goals came despite a lack of possession with just 29.6 per cent against Liverpool while they had 67 per cent against Brentford

            <p>
                This week, the free-kick count was only 11-7 against the hosts.  United also only mustered two corners last time out and improved that total to six in the win over Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United improved their discipline, although Bruno Fernandes was booked in both matches United made a total of 273 passes, 57 being long passes, with a passing accuracy of 65.9 per cent during the win over title challengers Liverpool
            </p>

                A key statistic being the passing accuracy in the opponents' half which was a total of 53.6 per cent while they only had a 12.5 per cent crossing accuracy in their total of eight crosses.  It's crazy what difference a week can make and of course a few tweaks with the former Ajax manager making the bold decision to drop captain Harry Maguire and superstar forward Cristiano Ronaldo from the starting line-up

                According to the FCC listing, the Sony Xperia 5 IV measures at 155.74 mm in length and 67.1 mm in width, while its display is recorded at 153.5mm – equivalent to 6.04-inches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Surprisingly, this suggests that the fourth iteration of the smartphone is slightly smaller than its predecessor, which measures at 6.1-inches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, the listing also suggests that it will also be equipped with wireless charging capability, which is a first for Sony’s compact flagship smartphone model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the listing did not provide any details on the allegedly upcoming smartphone’s key specifications such as its chipset, memory capacities, battery size and so on
            </p>
            
            <p>

                According to the FCC listing, the Sony Xperia 5 IV measures at 155.74 mm in length and 67.1 mm in width, while its display is recorded at 153.5mm – equivalent to 6.04-inches

                The New Generation Patrol Vessel project called for the construction of 27 patrol vessels, but only six ships were eventually completed, with the cost going up from RM5.35 billion to a total of RM6.75 billion through an additional contract

                A PAC report two weeks ago said that funds meant for the troubled RM9 billion littoral combat ship project had been used to resolve debts from the NGPV project

            <p>
                PAC chief Wong Kah Woh called for the NGPV report to be declassified since the LCS contractor, Boustead Naval Shipyard, had used funds meant for that project to resolve debts related to the patrol vessel project

            <p>
                He said the report showed that there had yet to be an in-depth probe into all activities related to the project’s implementation up until 2018, which meant that some important facts could have been left out

                With the numbers advantage, ONIC PH secured the Enhanced Lord, which eventually helped the team push towards the base of RSG to get the 1-0 lead

                After securing the Lord nine minutes into the game, ONIC marched with the buff in the top lane to try and end the game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was such a dominant game for the ONIC that RSG wasn’t able to get any kills throughout the game, compared to ONIC who had eight kills in 11 minutes of play

                SUPER FRINCE was the most valuable player of the game after securing 100% kill participation in the game

                Mahathir sought a full royal pardon for his former ally after they joined forces to win the elections that year, on the back of public anger on Najib’s handling of 1MDB

                His new party could form a minority government and Mahathir said he didn’t rule out a coalition with Anwar again, despite earlier squabbles over succession plans.  Still, Mahathir said he isn’t interested in becoming prime minister for a third time

                He said at about 6.50am on Saturday, the two suspects, claiming to be immigration officers, approached two Indonesian women near a hospital in Pandan Indah, Ampang, Selangor, purportedly wanting to check their passports and permits

                Another former ministerial colleague, Murad Saeed, told domestic television channels that the police had issued orders for Khan’s arrest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Islamabad police declined to confirm this, however
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Khan’s aide, Fawad Chaudhry, told reporters outside an Islamabad court that the party had applied for bail for the leader ahead of any arrest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saturday’s police report, seen by Reuters, cited Khan’s comments that he “would not spare” Islamabad’s police chief and a female judge for the arrest of his aide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The purpose of the speech was to spread terror amongst the police and the judiciary and prevent them from doing their duty,” police said in the report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The military, which has ruled directly for over three decades of Pakistan’s 75-year history, has rebuffed Khan’s claim

                The defence wanted to challenge the credibility of the 13th prosecution witness, Rafiq Hakim Razali, who is the former Angkatan Bersatu Anak Muda (Armada) assistant treasurer, following discrepancies between his testimony in court and the statement recorded from him by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) in 2020 on the withdrawal of RM1 million from Armada’s bank account

                Penang PAS committee member Abdul Razib Abd Rahim said the state committee supported the central committee’s ummah unification agenda
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Penang is well known for being the heartland of Pakatan Harapan (PH)-DAP, so the agenda of unifying Malay parties is even more important here to prevent PH from taking advantage of any split in Malay-Muslim votes,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The slogan ‘Islam unites the ummah’ should be backed by all PAS supporters, so that efforts to unite Malay political parties are successful and in line with shariah and party policy.” Razib said the parties, which he did not name, must be committed towards this cause to ensure Malay-Muslim interests were not denied and neglected in Penang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Penang PAS calls for all parties to forgo their personal interests in GE15, and ensure that the Malay-Muslim vote can be united for the well-being and harmony of the people,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, PAS secretary-general Takiyuddin Hassan said some divisions had proposed to strengthen the ummah and Muafakat Nasional (MN) in line with the party’s stance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have 197 divisions nationwide submitting their motions to PAS central for debate at the party’s 68th annual assembly on Sept 3 and 4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said PAS would continue to avoid clashes with Umno in GE15 because it would be detrimental to the solidarity of the ummah

                Penang PAS committee member Abdul Razib Abd Rahim said the state committee supported the central committee’s ummah unification agenda
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Penang is well known for being the heartland of Pakatan Harapan (PH)-DAP, so the agenda of unifying Malay parties is even more important here to prevent PH from taking advantage of any split in Malay-Muslim votes,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The slogan ‘Islam unites the ummah’ should be backed by all PAS supporters, so that efforts to unite Malay political parties are successful and in line with shariah and party policy.” Razib said the parties, which he did not name, must be committed towards this cause to ensure Malay-Muslim interests were not denied and neglected in Penang
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Penang PAS calls for all parties to forgo their personal interests in GE15, and ensure that the Malay-Muslim vote can be united for the well-being and harmony of the people,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previously, PAS secretary-general Takiyuddin Hassan said some divisions had proposed to strengthen the ummah and Muafakat Nasional (MN) in line with the party’s stance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have 197 divisions nationwide submitting their motions to PAS central for debate at the party’s 68th annual assembly on Sept 3 and 4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said PAS would continue to avoid clashes with Umno in GE15 because it would be detrimental to the solidarity of the ummah

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — PKR deputy president Rafizi Ramli claimed money for the littoral combat ship (LCS) project was funnelled into offshore companies owned by the wife of a former deputy minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said, in a statement, he received this information from internal investigations into the LCS scandal and from cross-checking with the database of offshore companies in the Paradise Papers, a 2017 tranche of leaked confidential records related to offshore investments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that it would have been impossible for then Finance Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and then Defence Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to not have known about this as it occurred with projects that they both managed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Thursday, Rafizi claimed that RM192 million had been funnelled from the LCS project to nonexistent, untraceable offshore accounts

            <p>
                “The invoice is sent from one company, but the payment instructions are for the invoice to be paid to an account registered under a company whose name is almost the same but a different company,” Rafizi said.

                The grainy clips showed a man shouting “siau lang” (meaning maniac) in Hokkien while destroying furniture at a Taoist temple in Batu Itam, Balik Pulau
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In multiple videos that have since gone viral on social media, the man – carrying a backpack and wearing a yellow long-sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans – went on wrecking spree, destroying the temple furniture in the foyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The footage also showed him desecrating the temple by urinating in front of the shuttered doors to the shrine hall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                OCPD Supt Kamarul Rizal Jenal said they were made aware of the incident yesterday after two videos of the man misbehaving at the temple grounds began circulating on social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Supt Kamarul said the case would be investigated under Section 295 of the Penal Code for defiling a place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class and Section 427 of the Penal Code for committing mischief

                The grainy clips showed a man shouting “siau lang” (meaning maniac) in Hokkien while destroying furniture at a Taoist temple in Batu Itam, Balik Pulau
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In multiple videos that have since gone viral on social media, the man – carrying a backpack and wearing a yellow long-sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans – went on wrecking spree, destroying the temple furniture in the foyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The footage also showed him desecrating the temple by urinating in front of the shuttered doors to the shrine hall
            </p>
            
            <p>
                OCPD Supt Kamarul Rizal Jenal said they were made aware of the incident yesterday after two videos of the man misbehaving at the temple grounds began circulating on social media
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Supt Kamarul said the case would be investigated under Section 295 of the Penal Code for defiling a place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class and Section 427 of the Penal Code for committing mischief

                Police and forensic investigators gather at the scene where suitcases with the remains of two children were found, after a family, who are not connected to the deaths, bought them at an online auction for an unclaimed locker, in Auckland, New Zealand, August 11, 2022 in this still image taken from video
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The woman, a Korean-born New Zealander, arrived in South Korea in 2018 and had no record of departure since then, a police officer told Reuters

                "New Zealand police had requested confirmation whether the person who might be related to a crime case was in South Korea," the police officer said, adding that given her past address and age, she could be the mother of the kids

                About Us Advertise LONDON, Aug 22 — Prince William and his wife Kate announced today that they will send all three of their children to the same private school after moving their main home to Windsor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kensington Palace said that from September third-in-line Prince George, aged nine, Princess Charlotte, seven, and four-year-old Prince Louis will attend Lambrook School, near Ascot in southern England
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The announcement came as the family are shifting their base from their London apartment at Kensington Palace to Adelaide Cottage, in the private Home Park near Windsor Castle, where Queen Elizabeth II lives most of the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family also have a country estate in Norfolk in eastern England and a holiday cottage in Scotland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                George and Charlotte previously went to a school in west London, Thomas’s Battersea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move announcement comes as William’s brother Prince Harry and his wife Meghan plan to stay in Frogmore Cottage, a short distance from Adelaide Cottage at Windsor, while visiting the UK to attend charity events in September

                About Us Advertise LONDON, Aug 22 — Prince William and his wife Kate announced today that they will send all three of their children to the same private school after moving their main home to Windsor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kensington Palace said that from September third-in-line Prince George, aged nine, Princess Charlotte, seven, and four-year-old Prince Louis will attend Lambrook School, near Ascot in southern England
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The announcement came as the family are shifting their base from their London apartment at Kensington Palace to Adelaide Cottage, in the private Home Park near Windsor Castle, where Queen Elizabeth II lives most of the time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family also have a country estate in Norfolk in eastern England and a holiday cottage in Scotland
            </p>
            
            <p>
                George and Charlotte previously went to a school in west London, Thomas’s Battersea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move announcement comes as William’s brother Prince Harry and his wife Meghan plan to stay in Frogmore Cottage, a short distance from Adelaide Cottage at Windsor, while visiting the UK to attend charity events in September
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the structural shift triggered by the pandemic will see demand remain at a higher level compared to the pre-pandemic period and resume a longer-term upward trend once the current demand-supply disequilibrium rebalances in time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are expecting the market to remain weak, competition to be intense and profit margins to continue to moderate,” the company said

                “Authorities should investigate the buildings’ structure to prevent a tragedy from happening.” Phra Khanong district deputy chief Warunluck Pholhan said she had instructed officials to check the structural integrity of the shophouses, measure the angle of tilt, and monitor for cracks or structural weakness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                District officials will also coordinate with the owners of Ture Digital Park and other neighbouring buildings to seek ways to secure the slumping shophouses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The district will issue an order for immediate demolition if the building is found to be a danger to the public,” she added.

                “Authorities should investigate the buildings’ structure to prevent a tragedy from happening.” Phra Khanong district deputy chief Warunluck Pholhan said she had instructed officials to check the structural integrity of the shophouses, measure the angle of tilt, and monitor for cracks or structural weakness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                District officials will also coordinate with the owners of Ture Digital Park and other neighbouring buildings to seek ways to secure the slumping shophouses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The district will issue an order for immediate demolition if the building is found to be a danger to the public,” she added.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 21 — Rafizi Ramli’s ‘Ayuh Malaysia’ campaign that aims to persuade people to vote will be ready to tour the country in one or two months

                He said the team would focus on the marginal seats to ensure Pakatan Harapan (PH) will be ready for the 15th General Election (GE15)

            <p>
                “We managed to reduce the backlog by 92%,” added Khairy

                The Health Minister said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob has given his commitment to gradually increase Malaysia’s public healthcare expenditure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Khairy said he had informed Ismail Sabri last week that Malaysia’s public healthcare expenditure is at 2.58% of the GDP, which is considered low for an upper-middle income country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the symposium, Khairy tabled achievements by the Health Ministry since he was appointed as the minister, nearly a year ago on Aug 26
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We managed to reduce the backlog by 92%,” added Khairy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This is the biggest increase since 2016,” said Khairy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Khairy said he was unapologetic over criticism for being stern in Malaysia’s Covid-19 immunisation programme

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Aug 21 — The investigation paper on the trial judge who heard Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s case over the misappropriation of RM42 million of government-owned firm SRC International Sdn Bhd is not with the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC), Tan Sri Idrus Harun said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last week, in a statement posted on Twitter, Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan claimed that a document alleged to be the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) investigation papers on judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali had been leaked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Maslan noted the Federal Court’s unanimous decision to reject Najib’s bid to admit new evidence on Mohd Nazlan’s purported conflict of interest as part of his final appeal over his conviction in the SRC International case, and that the MACC investigation paper on the judge was sent to the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) on May 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then said Umno is of the view that “MACC has to confirm or deny the validity of the investigation papers that have gone viral”, and that the “Attorney General’s Chambers has to announce if there will be further action for those investigation papers”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 23, news portal Malaysiakini reported Idrus as saying that the AGC is still examining the investigation papers by the MACC on Mohd Nazlan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We are perusing the investigation paper before we make our decision,” he was quoted as saying via a text message.

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 21 — PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Abdul Hadi Awang’s “racist and extremist anti-non-Bumi and anti-non-Muslim rhetoric” blaming them for being the root of corruption is a shrewd strategy designed to strengthen PAS’ electoral prospects in the general election, DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Marang MP also accused non-Muslims and non-Bumiputera of making up the bulk of what he called the “roots of corruption” to the detriment of the country’s economy and politics

            <p>
                “They then damage our politics as they are the roots for corruption and the majority of them are non-Muslims and non-Bumiputras,” he said in a posting on his Facebook page

            <p>
                By putting a racial and religious slant on corruption with false and baseless claims, Hadi has clearly positioned himself as the principal proponent against non-Bumis and non-Muslims in Malaysia,” Lim added

                The court had set Aug 15 to 19 and Aug 23 to 26 to hear the appeal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Haniff Khatri Abdulla said this was because the court could decide based on the written submissions filed previously by Najib’s defence team at the Court of Appeal last year

            </p>

                The lawyer once again asked the court to postpone the hearing to this Thursday as he had other cases on Tuesday and Wednesday, but it was rejected by the court

            <p>
                On Aug 16, the court had dismissed Hisyam’s application to postpone the appeal hearing and ordered the appeal to proceed on Aug 18
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last December, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s decision and dismissed Najib’s appeal to set aside his conviction and jail sentence as well as the fine

            <p>
                He said the Keluarga Malaysia government under his leadership always appreciated the sacrifices of civil servants, including members of the security forces, under the leadership of the Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Mohd Zuki Ali

                Two members of the Family Frontiers group said they had reports of Malaysian women unable to return to Malaysia with their children because of the citizenship problem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group’s lead coordinator, Bina Ramanand, said one Malaysian living overseas who contacted Family Frontiers had said she was trapped in an abusive marriage as her husband would not allow her to return to Malaysia with her children
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing another case handled by Family Frontiers, she said there was a Malaysian forced to remain in South America, where her child was born
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Their problem is that their children are not automatically made Malaysian citizens although their mother is Malaysian
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 5, the Court of Appeal ruled in a split decision that children born overseas to Malaysian mothers could be denied citizenship by law
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Non-citizen children cannot be enrolled in schools until all their Malaysian counterparts have been registered, which could be up to 10 months later

                Two members of the Family Frontiers group said they had reports of Malaysian women unable to return to Malaysia with their children because of the citizenship problem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The group’s lead coordinator, Bina Ramanand, said one Malaysian living overseas who contacted Family Frontiers had said she was trapped in an abusive marriage as her husband would not allow her to return to Malaysia with her children
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Citing another case handled by Family Frontiers, she said there was a Malaysian forced to remain in South America, where her child was born
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Their problem is that their children are not automatically made Malaysian citizens although their mother is Malaysian
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Aug 5, the Court of Appeal ruled in a split decision that children born overseas to Malaysian mothers could be denied citizenship by law
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Non-citizen children cannot be enrolled in schools until all their Malaysian counterparts have been registered, which could be up to 10 months later

                This could happen once the police applies to impose these penalties against negligent parents under Section 33 of the Child Act 2001 in order to hold parents accountable when their underaged children end up as illegal racers, said Penang deputy police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Fisol Salleh

            <p>
                “Non-Muslims would return willingly to their hometown to vote, unlike Muslims, who do not want to take part in the electoral process which ultimately led to political power being snatched by others,” he said

                Hadi also wrote a Facebook posting that put the focus on non-Muslims and non-Bumiputeras as being the majority involved in corruption
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “In fact the majority of those involved in ruining the country’s politics and economy, were non-Muslims and non-Bumiputeras,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier, in his convention speech warning Muslims not to be apathetic about voting, he said that non-Muslims never disregarded politics, even if they were working in “the jungles of Sabah and Sarawak” or overseas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Non-Muslims would return willingly to their hometown to vote, unlike Muslims, who do not want to take part in the electoral process which ultimately led to political power being snatched by others,” he said

            <p>
                Hadi went on to say that it has become PAS’ responsibility to raise awareness among Malays about the importance of taking part in the country’s politics

                About Us Advertise SINGAPORE, Aug 21 — With the Covid-19 pandemic situation stabilising in Singapore, the Government will further relax rules on wearing of face masks in public, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To curb the spread of the coronavirus, people here used to have to put on face masks when they leave their homes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This rule was relaxed from March 29, with the wearing of face masks mandated only in indoor settings, though people were still encouraged to wear them when they leave home, especially in crowded areas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that beyond the infection controls, Singapore must learn the lessons from the pandemic, and be ready for a possible future where “a new virus will emerge, more transmissible, more adaptable and more dangerous than Covid-19”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The most important lesson is to maintain the spirit of personal and social responsibility,” Lee said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Continue to nurture the trust in our society — day in, day out — during normal times, so that during the next crisis, we can again draw upon a deep reservoir of trust to see us through, just like we have done during Covid-19.” In his speech, Lee also announced a new special state award called the Covid-19 Resilience Medal that will be presented to people who played a direct part in the fight against the pandemic.

                The embassy, in a Facebook post on Saturday (Aug 20), said it will accept visa applications from Malaysian students receiving long-term academic education in China from now on

            <p>
                The responsible departments of China and Malaysia have been working closely with each other on the return of Malaysian students to China and have made some progress," it said

            <p>
                According to media reports, about 8,000 Malaysian students have not been able to return to China to resume their studies due to the Covid-19 lockdowns

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 20 — Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob was an unexpected choice to succeed Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, but political observers believe his appointment as Malaysia’s ninth prime minister last year is keeping the nation moving forward through economic and political crises both at home and globally

                Bantuan Keluarga Malaysia, better known as BKM locally, is the direct cash aid initiative under Ismail Sabri’s “Keluarga Malaysia” concept targeted to benefit Malaysian wage earners in the bottom 40 percentile

            <p>
                Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia political analyst Kartini Aboo Talib commended Ismail Sabri for enlarging his “Keluarga Malaysia” concept to “Keluarga Global” as instrumental for political stability within Asean during the Covid-19 era

            <p>
                Incidental nation-builder Universiti Sains Malaysia’s political scientist Ahmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid said that Ismail Sabri’s ability to weather the storm shaking Malaysia’s political stability might have helped the 62-year-old increase his support among Malaysians

            <p>
                Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, an associate director with Vriens & Partners — a public policy, government affairs and political risk consultancy — said Ismail Sabri’s biggest contribution in his first year as PM was showing he has political will to push through institutional and health reforms

                Ravinthran, and Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, also affirmed the decision of the High Court that disallowed Aminah Abdullah’s application for a declaration that six million shares in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd were also part of her son’s estate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Justice Mohd Nazlan, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision in an online proceeding yesterday, dismissed the appeal brought by Jamaluddin’s children – Ikhwan Hafiz and Nur Anis – and the cross-appeal by Aminah

                Aminah was appealing against the High Court’s dismissal of her application to include the Alpine Motion and Ivory Insights shares as part of her son’s estate, while her grandchildren were appealing against the High Court’s ruling to put the Rantai Wawasan shares in the list of their father’s estate

            <p>
                In her statement of claim, Aminah claimed that her grandchildren failed to enter the shares of the three companies – Rantai Wawasan, Alpine Motion and Ivory Insight – as part of the deceased’s estate with the intention of denying her rights and interests as a beneficiary

                After failing to get more time to handle his appeal the court heard today that Najib would discharge Zaid's firm from his case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib explained that he opted to discharge Muhammad Shafee and his team after losing both his case and his appeal at the High Court and the Court of Appeal respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The hearing at the country’s supreme court had been scheduled to take place over nine days, from August 15 to August 19, and will resume after this weekend from August 23 to August 26
            </p>
            
            <p>
                August 15 and 16 were spent hearing Najib’s bid to add new evidence and seek a postponement that was ultimately disallowed by the Federal Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The court then fixed August 18 as the start of the main SRC International appeal hearing
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The case is now at the Federal Court, and it is Najib’s last chance to convince the judges that his conviction and punishment should be overturned.
