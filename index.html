                “Thus, it is relevant for us to establish that he is in a position to make the payment out of his personal money,” he said, adding that the defence had asked a prosecution witness from Parliament, Rosli Mat Jinun, to produce Shahrir’s monthly salaries and allowances starting from 1978

                Earlier today, Firoz questioned Rosli on Shahrir’s monthly salaries and allowances after Shahrir was elected as Johor Bahru MP more than 40 years ago

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Court of Appeal also upheld his 12-year jail sentence and RM210 million fine, which was also not paid

                Today, deputy public prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin submitted that Najib had obtained the stay of sentence and conviction “at one go” in the High Court, which was maintained by the Court of Appeal

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Devanandan said the prosecution’s argument that Peter was not entitled to stay his conviction because he had partially fulfilled his sentence, was flawed

                "This system will be operational in three more weeks under the supervision of the Malaysia-Indonesia Joint Working Group," he said in a joint statement with his Indonesian counterpart Ida Fauziyah on Thursday (July 28)

                Saravanan believes that the resolution of the issues in the MoU of the PDI will lead to the smooth entry of Indonesian workers into Malaysia in the domestic service sector as well as other sectors that are allowed to employ foreign workers

                On July 13, Indonesia announced the decision to temporarily freeze the entry of all the country's workers into Malaysia for not using the single system as previously agreed
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saravanan was in Jakarta in conjunction with the meeting of the Joint Working Group between Malaysia and Indonesia as outlined in the MoU regarding the PDI which was completed on July 27

                In June 2019, the defence ministry had lodged a report with MACC over the purchase of the six helicopters in 2015, which it had yet to receive at that time

                The Singapore Court of Appeal said LFL had abused the system by joining the pair in filing a criminal motion seeking a review of an earlier decision to uphold the death sentences, The Straits Times reported
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Charles Yeo, the counsel for Singaporean Roslan Bakar and Sabahan Pausi Jefridin, was also ordered to pay S$4,000 in costs to the attorney-general

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court said the motion filed by the duo and LFL caused the Singaporean attorney-general to incur unnecessary cost in both proceedings
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Roslan and Pausi were arrested in 2008 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death two years later

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The duo were initially scheduled to be sent to the gallows on Feb 16, but Yeo filed a criminal motion seeking a review of the apex court’s 2018 decision

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Public Bank Bhd banking services manager Tan Kok Kiong, 32, said he also could not confirm that the money which was deposited through a cheque dated March 22, 2014, into a Public Bank account in the name of ZAM Engineering & Construction was entrusted to Shahrir

                “What will happen to the bill if Parliament is dissolved before it is passed?”, asked Hassan Karim (PH-Pasir Gudang) while debating the anti-hopping bill
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Is there enough time to pass the bill in both Houses (Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara) as well as to present it to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong for his assent?” Hassan urged Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob and law minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar to guarantee that the dissolution of Parliament would not stop the bill from being enacted

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The current Parliament’s term is until July 16 next year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A political agreement signed between Ismail’s government and Pakatan Harapan (PH) last September states that the next general election cannot be held before July 31

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 27 — A bank officer today told the High Court that he could not confirm whether the money amounting to RM63,800 which was deposited into a bank account in the name of an engineering and construction company, belonged personally to Tan Sri Shahrir Ab Samad

                Public Bank Berhad Banking Services manager Tan Kok Kiong, 32, said he also could not confirm that the money which was deposited through a cheque, dated March 22, 2014, into Public Bank’s account in the name of ZAM Engineering & Construction, was entrusted to Shahrir

                Tan, who works at Muar branch of Public Bank agreed with the lawyer’s suggestion that he could not confirm if the money that went into the company’s bank account was actually a reimbursement

                Meanwhile, the witness said the RM63,800 was a normal transaction that was not suspicious because it was not a large amount for a company account

                Larry Sng (PBM-Julau) said the proposed bill would put independent MPs at a disadvantage because they would have to vacate their seats should they join a party
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The minister (Wan Junaidi) must recognise political realities and consider all factors involving independent MPs,” he told the Dewan Rakyat when debating the anti-hopping bill
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sng questioned why an independent MP had to vacate his seat if he joined a party, yet an MP who was sacked by his party was not required to do so
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                RSN Rayer (PH-Jelutong) interjected, pointing out that Sng was an independent MP before joining PKR, only to leave the party to become independent again and later formed Parti Bangsa Malaysia
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sng responded by saying the law should not be based on the actions of one or two individuals and called for a more comprehensive law to protect independent MPs

            <p> </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                DAP’s Lim Yi Wei said the status of the plan was not included in a written reply by women, family and community development minister Rina Harun
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “How is the ministry measuring the progress of the national strategic plan (in handling the causes of child marriage)? “What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the six factors outlined in the plan?” the Kampung Tunku assemblyman said in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to the national plan, the six factors are low household income and poverty; lack of access to sexual reproductive health education and parenting skills; lack of access to education and poor school attendance; stigma on child marriages to address problems; vague laws that provide for marriage under the age of 18; and coordination of marital data and underage divorce
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim also called on the ministry to provide figures on the number of child marriages in 2021, noting reports that such unions had taken place despite the Covid-19 pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim went on to chide the ministry’s response to PKR MP Maria Chin Abdullah as “generic”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The minister and her deputy should tackle child marriages more aggressively instead of providing generic written replies in Parliament.” The national plan was launched by then deputy prime minister Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who was also women, family and community development minister, in 2020

                "We have collectively agreed there is no need for a new MOU or agreement," he told reporters after launching PTPTN’s 25th Silver Jubilee Anniversary celebrations at Matrade Exhibition and Convention Centre Wednesday (July 27)

                Instead, what matters more was that issues stated in the MOU were resolved, he said, adding that this includes the Anti-Party Hopping law and laws on political funding

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said the MOU did not explicitly state an end date but only that it would be in effect until Parliament was dissolved

                With the formation of Malaysia in 1963, Malaysia then continued making such annual payments and without interruption until 2013
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But Thomas said the Sulu claimants are not entitled at all to make such an argument over what Sabah is worth now in 2022, as the Sulu sultan had already given away Sabah when he signed the 1878 documents and no longer owns these lands
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Thomas also alleged that the Spanish arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa — whose appointment as arbitrator had been challenged by Malaysia — was a “rogue” arbitrator who had “rewrote” the 1878 document when deciding on February 28, 2022 to order Malaysia to pay US$14.9 billion to the eight Sulu claimants

                Even while disputing the entire arbitration, Thomas also said the US$14.9 billion award was made against the government of Malaysia and which means only Malaysia’s assets can be subject to execution
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                The award does not bind Petronas, and cannot be enforced against the assets of Petronas,” Thomas said of the US$14.9 billion award

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To another question, Zarul Ahmad told the court he was instructed by Lim to issue media statements for the purpose of discrediting a RM22 million graft allegation levelled against the company back in July 2018
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim is facing an amended charge of using his position as Penang chief minister back then to receive a bribe of RM3.3 million in helping the company owned by Zarul Ahmad to obtain a construction project worth RM6,341,383,702

                Azli had told the court last month that what Zarul asked him and Ibrahim to process from 2012 to 2017 were bribes to Lim

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Today, Zarul said he knew that using fake payment vouchers and invoices was a criminal offence

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim is standing trial on charges of using his position as then Penang chief minister to ask Zarul for a 10% cut of the profits from the undersea tunnel project and accepting RM3.3 million in kickbacks from the businessman
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Zarul also told the court that Lim instructed him to give statements to the media, after Zarul was released from Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) detention

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court had heard that between 2013 and 2014, Zarul paid a total of RM200,000 to Lim to “fulfil” part of his promise to give him a 10% cut of the project’s profits
            </p>

                Simon explained that the most common form of bullying is verbal, but non-verbal actions such as ignoring a subordinate as well as cyber bullying are also common in the manufacturing and services sectors

                A recent research revealed that if workplace bullying goes unnoticed or is ignored, the victim can potentially be driven to suicide

                In a parliamentary written reply, Rina said the statistics department reported 1,856 child marriages in 2018, which went down to 1,459 in 2019 and reduced further to 1,124 in 2020

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Responding to a question from Maria Chin Abdullah (PH-Petaling Jaya), Rina said her ministry was implementing its national strategic plan in handling the causes of child marriage, which involves the federal and state governments, NGOs and international organisations

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She said the strategic plan looked at issues across various sectors, such as the law, education, health, parenting, social support and poverty eradication in addressing child marriages at the grassroots level

                THE Thai authorities have apprehended wanted Malaysian fugitive Tedy Teow Wooi Huat after police there cracked down on gambling syndicates in Southern Thailand

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to Thai police, Teow is believed to be the major financier for online gambling rings in the kingdom

                The final straw for Malaysian authorities came in 2021 was when police busted a huge Macau syndicate and linked it to Teow and his two sons as their main suspects

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                According to the police, the syndicate would get victims to transfer money to a mule account which they would then syphon off into other accounts

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 — Kashturi Patto (Batu Kawan-PH) was ejected from Dewan Rakyat after she repeatedly challenged Deputy Speaker Datuk Rashid Hasnon over his ruling on Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman’s (Pasir Salak-BN) remarks from last week
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Kashturi earlier asked about her letter to the Speaker regarding an alleged sexist remark Tajuddin said off-microphone when debating the Anti-Sexual Harrasment Bill on July 20, and Rashid said today that he already took action

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 -- The highly controversial Independent Police Conduct Commission (IPCC) Bill 2020 has been passed in Parliament after being tabled by Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainuddin for its second reading today
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The IPCC Bill was tabled for its first reading in the Dewan Rakyat by then Deputy Home Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Mohamed Said in August 2020
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The IPCC Bill was introduced to replace the Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission (IPCMC) Bill that was tabled in Parliament by the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government in 2019
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The IPCMC Bill had proposed that "the Commission may initiate investigations notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the Commission may commence an investigation on its own initiative but only if the Commission is satisfied that the subject matter of the investigation is of significant interest to the public or that it is in the public interest to do so whether or not there is a complaint of misconduct relating to it”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Other recommendations removed under the IPCC include suggested disciplinary jurisdiction over any misconduct committed by any member of the police force and the powers to exercise disciplinary jurisdiction over any complaint concerning the misconduct of any member of the police force
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It added that the IPCC will further weaken the already inadequate oversight mechanism, the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission (EAIC), when Malaysia is in desperate need of an independent commission overseeing the police.

                In submitting a memorandum on the issue to the home ministry, outside the Parliament building, the PKR-backed group said 68% of commercial crimes since May 2020 involved online scams

                Khairy said that the disruption of supply was due to the total lockdown in China where most of the supply for active ingredients for pharmaceutical products are produced and the Russia-Ukraine war where an ingredient which is added to the active ingredient was produced

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairy (BN-Rembau) added that the ministry has also agreed to release its stockpile to the private sector

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To ensure the country's drug security and self-reliance in times of crisis, local pharmaceutical companies are encouraged to produce their own active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) through public-private partnerships

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In addition to that, Khairy added that the ministry would also advocate pharmaceutical product patency by strengthening its cooperation with the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia to prevent patent ever-greening

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In a related note, Khairy said the ministry was looking into the implementation of price control through the price transparency mechanism
