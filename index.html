                founder Jeff Bezos is taking off
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stock market has been wildly unpredictable and extremely volatile this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether it's from the words of Elon Musk or Jerome Powell, the market fluctuates as a result
            </p>
            
            <p>
                may be moving from a housing boom into a housing bust
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Home prices and interest rates are high
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time, the stock market is as volatile as ever, if not floundering, so people are looking for safer options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bezos not only made a bet on this being the case last year, but he doubled down on it earlier this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em — Bezos certainly stands to make money off his gamble, but so can the average investor with as little as $100 to invest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Investing in fractional ownership will not only to diversify your portfolio, but help hedge against a volatile market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first of these offerings was fully funded in under 30 minutes Fractional real estate allows investors to use dollar cost averaging and invest through all market cycles, instead of having to time the market and predict the right time to buy

                The Kop will be sad to see him depart, though in reality at 31 years old, Liverpool will definitely be saying farewell to Firmino at the right time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, should Firmino, who made another 16 goal contributions last season and already six in eight games this season, depart next summer, Liverpool will have to find another player to maintain Jürgen Klopp's depth in attack
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And in order to find him, the Reds may have been given an ideal glimpse at a player who could be the perfect potential replacement for Firmino
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Flamengo's 25-year-old forward, Pedro, is regarded by many as one of the heirs to Firmino's throne in the national team, and it's easy to see why
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The forward has a similar work rate and is blessed with a technical ability that is on par with Firmino
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! This season, Pedro has already scored 24 goals for Flamengo in 53 games, but just like Firmino, his game doesn't solely rely on goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the most recent international break, Pedro showed a glimpse of his talent for the Brazilian national team, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That goal highlighted Pedro's ability to step up and play at a higher level
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He may not just be an ideal heir to Firmino's throne at international level, but perhaps at Anfield, too.

                No.8 bus in Bangkok, which is known for overtaking

            <p>
                Welcome aboard the No.8 bus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Infamous in the Thai capital, the No.8 route has spawned parody songs, viral TikToks, horrified YouTube videos and even a feature-length Fast & Furious-style film
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is a competition,” said driver Aphisak Sodmui, who has helmed his “hot” bus – as the non-airconditioned open-windowed models are known – for the past decade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The problem, according to Thai transport expert Sumet Ongkittikul, lies with the private firms that lease the route concession from the central Bangkok Mass Transit Authority
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Driver Aphisak supplements his daily wage of between 150 and 200 baht (RM18.50 and RM24.50) with 10% of the daily ticket sales
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have to complete the route at least four times a day for us to have enough money to live,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Passenger Sai Pin, 47, said she had seen a change since the transition to the new buses with a slightly higher fare of 15 baht (RM1.85)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With the old buses, you might encounter lots of fast driving

                No.8 bus in Bangkok, which is known for overtaking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Welcome aboard the No.8 bus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Infamous in the Thai capital, the No.8 route has spawned parody songs, viral TikToks, horrified YouTube videos and even a feature-length Fast & Furious-style film
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is a competition,” said driver Aphisak Sodmui, who has helmed his “hot” bus – as the non-airconditioned open-windowed models are known – for the past decade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The problem, according to Thai transport expert Sumet Ongkittikul, lies with the private firms that lease the route concession from the central Bangkok Mass Transit Authority
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Driver Aphisak supplements his daily wage of between 150 and 200 baht (RM18.50 and RM24.50) with 10% of the daily ticket sales
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We have to complete the route at least four times a day for us to have enough money to live,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Passenger Sai Pin, 47, said she had seen a change since the transition to the new buses with a slightly higher fare of 15 baht (RM1.85)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “With the old buses, you might encounter lots of fast driving

                Premier League • England A pundit reckons David Moyes could take the surprise decision to drop Jarrod Bowen amid his struggles in the Premier League recently
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This helped West Ham finish seventh in the league and reach the last four of the Europa Conference League, where they lost to eventual winners Eintracht Frankfurt
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bowen’s impressive campaign has also seen him become part of the England squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bowen hasn’t hit the ground running this term and is yet to score in the Prem
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the West Ham ace has seen his form drop off, Rashford and Sancho are looking much better and could therefore get in the England World Cup squad ahead of him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “West Ham have been very successful and he [Bowen] has been a massive part of that success in winning football matches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It’s been a slow start for West Ham this year and most of their players
            </p>
            
            <p>

                He’s a very talented player but he hasn’t got his Premier League game going yet.” Bowen will certainly be looking to get among the goals when West Ham return to action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Antonio has proven he is able to lead the line effectively for West Ham, all while being the only striker at the club

                Borrowers with incomes of less than $125,000 (or $250,000 for a couple) can qualify for up to $10,000 in debt forgiveness on their federal direct student loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This includes at least some of the loans issued through the Federal Family Education Loan, Federal Perkins Loan and Health Education Assistance Loan programs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Initially, the administration said that qualified borrowers with these privately held loans could consolidate them into a federal direct loan and obtain debt relief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Thursday, however, the department's website said that to receive relief, borrowers had to have applied for a consolidation loan by Sept
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some FFEL and Perkins loans are held by the Education Department, so they remain eligible for the blanket forgiveness if the borrowers meet the income limits
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To find out whether your FFEL or Perkins loans could qualify for forgiveness, go to your account at the Federal Student Aid site (studentaid.gov) and call up the “My Loan Servicers” list
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If the servicer’s name is preceded by “DEPT OF ED,” that loan is held by the federal government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                More than 5 million of those loans are held by the Education Department
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of the remaining, privately held but federally guaranteed loans, only a portion of the borrowers would meet the income limits for blanket loan forgiveness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The change was reported on the same day that six Republican-controlled states sued to block the blanket debt forgiveness, arguing that the administration didn't have the authority to wipe out student loan balances
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By cutting off the ability to qualify for forgiveness by consolidating privately held FFELs, Perkins loans and HEALs into a direct loan, the administration is reducing lenders' and servicing companies' loss of future earnings

                Jamal Musiala scored once and set up two more goals as champions Bayern Munich cruised past Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 on Friday to snap a four-game winless run in the Bundesliga

                The Germany international delivered a superb performance for a confidence-boosting win ahead of Tuesday's Champions League group game against Viktoria Plzen and the big Bundesliga match against Borussia Dortmund next weekend
            </p>

                "Everyone in the team wanted to win today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pressure is always there at Bayern." In a frenzied start, Musiala set up Leroy Sane for their first goal in the third minute to settle nerves in the Allianz Arena as the Bavarians were desperate to bounce back following their recent dip in form and their longest run without a win in 20 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then helped Sadio Mane end his five-game goal drought, picking out the Senegalese in the box who sent another deflected effort past goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky for his first goal in front of a home crowd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Musiala has now scored five times in the league and set up three goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The win lifted Bayern into second place in the Bundesliga on 15 points, two behind leaders Union Berlin, who travel to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday

                The interest rate on those loans could surge to 7.54% in the new year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So all those payments take away from your retirement income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While these credit card balances should be paid down quickly, you shouldn’t let them delay saving for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, consider lowering your mortgage payments to use those funds to pay down other high interest loans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finally, auto loans are another area to pay off before retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As of August 2022, the average car loan for a buyer with good credit was 7.88%, according to MyAutoloan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if you have bad credit, that soars up to 19.87%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s about as much as the interest rate on a credit card
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What’s more, you’ll have to take into consideration these payments for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If $400 goes into a car payment, and $300 to a credit card and more for student loans, suddenly you have far less cash on hand for your retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So why not pay down your mortgage too? It’s not just lower interest rates, although with the average national mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed rate at about 6.5%, that is an advantage

                But how much money do you realistically need to be able to drop out of the workforce and get by on dividend payouts alone? While you will have to start by honestly assessing what you can live with — and without
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But there’s a simple formula and some less simple risks you’ll need to consider when making the big dividend-dependency decision
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For straight-up equity investors, those cash payouts fuel dividend income — where passively generated payouts cover your living expenses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How much you’ll need exactly depends on your income, spending habits and living expenses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But once you know how much you’ll need to live, here’s a simple formula to apply that to sort out how much you need in total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Next, consider what you can reasonably expect from dividend yields
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s fair to plan on yield rates between 1% and 6%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dividend payments from a taxable brokerage account, or traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts, are considered taxable income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you think you can manage expenses at a median dividend income, then planning is everything
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Handled carefully, the pursuit of steady, sustainable dividend income can be a winning play
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For older Americans, living off dividend income could make sense, especially if it delays taking a Social Security benefit

                Genco Shipping (GNK) The first company we’ll look at is Genco Shipping, a bulk carrier in the global ocean shipping network
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company’s last declared dividend, paid out in August, was for 50 cents per common share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At its current rate, the dividend yields 16.5%, well ahead of the inflation rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Nolan’s view, Genco is a Buy with a target price of $20, implying a one-year upside potential of 65%

            <p>
                (To watch Nolan’s track record, click here) Nolan is hardly alone in his upbeat take on Genco

                (EGLE) The second stock dividend stock we'll look at is Eagle Bulk Shipping, another player in the drybulk carriage sector
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the current rate, the dividend annualizes to $8.80 and gives a yield of 21%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The dividend was last paid out in August
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is another company whose performance – and especially, dividend performance – have caught Nolan’s attention

            <p>
                The stock has an average price target of $72.40, which indicates ~76% upside potential from the trading price of $41.21

            <p>
                The company’s last declared dividend, paid out in August, was for 50 cents per common share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At its current rate, the dividend yields 16.5%, well ahead of the inflation rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Nolan’s view, Genco is a Buy with a target price of $20, implying a one-year upside potential of 65%

            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the current rate, the dividend annualizes to $8.80 and gives a yield of 21%

            <p>
                The dividend was last paid out in August

                The company had a net income of $1.33 billion, an increase of $700 million year-over-year, or 90%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the second quarter of 2022, ET had a DCF of $1.88 billion, up a solid $500 million from the year-ago quarter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is the source of the company’s dividend, so the increase is important
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ET set its most recent dividend, for the second quarter of the year, paid out in August at 23 cents per common share
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This yield matches the current rate of inflation; investors can use this dividend to provide a stronger level of protection against the effects of price inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~45% potential total return profile
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The stock has a trading price of $10.97 and an average price target of $15.20, implying a one-year upside of ~39%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Proceeds from these properties generated Q2 revenues of $70.5 million, for a 44% year-over-year increase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These results meant that IIPR’s dividend is affordable – and in fact, management raised the dividend payment in the most recent declaration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At that yield, it almost matches the rate of inflation

            <p>
                Former Goldman Sachs uber-economist Jim O’Neill worries about a 1997-98 redux thanks to the yen’s 26% decline this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In September 1997, I also was in Beijing when Rubin and Summers cajoled Chinese officials not to devalue the yuan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was China devaluing the yuan that scared them the most
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The worry was that a weaker yuan might trigger a fresh wave of competitive devaluations not just in developing Asia, but Japan, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is once again a live concern as the yuan blows past 7 to the dollar at a moment when China’s economy is growing at the slowest pace in 30 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This week, the People’s Bank of China stepped up its defense of the yuan, cautioning against one-way bets on the currency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thanks to the yuan’s downward trajectory, PBOC policy options are increasingly a mystery

                Former Goldman Sachs uber-economist Jim O’Neill worries about a 1997-98 redux thanks to the yen’s 26% decline this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In September 1997, I also was in Beijing when Rubin and Summers cajoled Chinese officials not to devalue the yuan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was China devaluing the yuan that scared them the most
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The worry was that a weaker yuan might trigger a fresh wave of competitive devaluations not just in developing Asia, but Japan, too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That is once again a live concern as the yuan blows past 7 to the dollar at a moment when China’s economy is growing at the slowest pace in 30 years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This week, the People’s Bank of China stepped up its defense of the yuan, cautioning against one-way bets on the currency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thanks to the yuan’s downward trajectory, PBOC policy options are increasingly a mystery
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The PBOC has to control the pace of M2 growth,” Sun says
            </p>

            <p>
                Liverpool are considering signing young Egyptian attacker Ibrahim Adel in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                90min report that Liverpool scouts were already ‘familiar’ with Adel before Salah’s recommendation, though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But should Liverpool make a move, Adel would have to be loaned out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As he wouldn’t be able to come into the first team straight away on account of work permit issues, Adel would be a signing for the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At twenty-one, he’s already broken into the Egyptian national team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As far as comparisons go, it would feel lazy to lump him into the Salah bracket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In that respect, perhaps a move to Liverpool wouldn’t do Adel much good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because he wouldn’t be able to play straight away, this may make it difficult for him to live up to that tag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The figures involved make it no gamble at all for Liverpool
            </p>

                If not, Liverpool could still earn a good fee from him as they did with the likes of Taiwo Awoniyi, who never played for the club during a six-year spell

            <p>
                Liverpool are considering signing young Egyptian attacker Ibrahim Adel in January
            </p>
            
            <p>
                90min report that Liverpool scouts were already ‘familiar’ with Adel before Salah’s recommendation, though
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But should Liverpool make a move, Adel would have to be loaned out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As he wouldn’t be able to come into the first team straight away on account of work permit issues, Adel would be a signing for the future
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At twenty-one, he’s already broken into the Egyptian national team
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As far as comparisons go, it would feel lazy to lump him into the Salah bracket
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In that respect, perhaps a move to Liverpool wouldn’t do Adel much good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Because he wouldn’t be able to play straight away, this may make it difficult for him to live up to that tag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The figures involved make it no gamble at all for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If he develops as Salah did, he’ll make a fine player
            </p>

            <p>

                The prosecution witness said this during cross-examination by Najib’s lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed in the RM2.28bil 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) trial here yesterday

                “The expansion project is also expected to create an additional value of RM552mil in local sourcing of raw materials and components.” In the same statement, Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow said the project will bring in investment, strengthen the socio-economy, increase job creation and provide opportunities for local talents to upskill

            <p>
                “The expansion project is also expected to create an additional value of RM552mil in local sourcing of raw materials and components.” In the same statement, Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow said the project will bring in investment, strengthen the socio-economy, increase job creation and provide opportunities for local talents to upskill

                About Us Advertise   LONDON, Sept 30 ― At a ceremony denounced by Ukraine as a “Kremlin freak show”, Russian President Vladimir Putin will proclaim the annexation of four Ukrainian regions today, escalating his seven-month war and taking it into an unpredictable new phase

                The hurried annexations mean front lines will now run through territory that Russia is declaring as its own, and which Putin has said he is ready to defend with nuclear weapons if necessary

            <p>
                One of the most common ways to create this income is to buy yourself an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Essentially, an annuity is an insurance contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will generally be a minimum payment that guarantees you don't lose your principal, but it's possible that the money won't grow at all, which is not a concern with a fixed annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of this is determined when you buy your annuity contact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That percentage only ticks up to 95.9% if you use an annuity, not enough of a difference to justify using an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Social Security Bridge – Another Option Morningstar also details an alternative plan for making sure you have enough money in retirement without having to buy an annuity, a strategy known as the Social Security Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you turn 70, you file for Social Security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you start taking these payments, you can reduce the amount of money you take out of your retirement accounts each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Morningstar analysis, though, shows that if you have at least 36 times your needed annual income saved at the time of retirement, you likely don't need to get an annuity

            <p>
                One of the most common ways to create this income is to buy yourself an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Essentially, an annuity is an insurance contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will generally be a minimum payment that guarantees you don't lose your principal, but it's possible that the money won't grow at all, which is not a concern with a fixed annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All of this is determined when you buy your annuity contact
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That percentage only ticks up to 95.9% if you use an annuity, not enough of a difference to justify using an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Social Security Bridge – Another Option Morningstar also details an alternative plan for making sure you have enough money in retirement without having to buy an annuity, a strategy known as the Social Security Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you turn 70, you file for Social Security
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you start taking these payments, you can reduce the amount of money you take out of your retirement accounts each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Morningstar analysis, though, shows that if you have at least 36 times your needed annual income saved at the time of retirement, you likely don't need to get an annuity

                Retirement Planning Tips The best way to go about planning your retirement is often to get professional help

                Saving in a 401(k) is how most people accumulate money for retirement

                But that’s not what Kiyosaki is doing right now

            <p>
                Here’s a look at what Kiyosaki prefers instead

            <p>
                Precious metals — particularly gold and silver — have been a popular hedge against inflation and uncertainties
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The price of gold is actually down about 9% in 2022, while silver has fallen by nearly 20%
            </p>

                I think $15,000 is not out of the question for gold,” Kiyosaki says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While there are many ways to gain exposure to gold and silver, he prefers to just buy the metal directly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this year, he tweeted that he only wants “real gold or silver coins” and not the ETFs

                It has all happened before.” The lesson here, as Rogers explains, is that “usually towards the end, stocks go crazy.” One of the surest signs of inflation is the rally in commodity prices we saw earlier this year

                The fund that tracks the index — Elements Rogers International Commodity Index-Total Return ETN (RJI) — is up 12% year to date

            <p>
                Of course, gold has the same function, but Rogers actually favors the grey metal for now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Silver is down something like 70 or 80% from its all-time high and gold is 15% below its all-time high,” he says

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 29 — Heirs of a late South-east Asian sultan today asked a Dutch court for permission to seize Malaysian assets in the Netherlands, their lawyer said, seeking enforcement of a US$15 billion (RM70 billion) arbitration award granted to them against Malaysia’s government
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia’s government, which has said it does not recognise the heirs’ claim, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Dutch petition
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A French arbitration court in February ordered Malaysia to pay the US$15 billion sum — the second largest arbitration award on record — to the descendents of the last Sultan of Sulu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia obtained a stay on the ruling pending an appeal, but the award remains enforceable outside France under a United Nations treaty on international arbitration
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The heirs of the sultan, who once controlled a territory spanning rainforest-covered islands in the southern Philippines and parts of Borneo island, asked the Dutch court to recognise and enforce the arbitration award
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The heirs wish to take “recourse against assets of Malaysia, which are located in the Netherlands”, according to a copy of the court petition shared by their lawyer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Reuters was unable to immediately verify the filing with Dutch court authorities
            </p>

                Thursday, 29 Sep 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ASP Salwani Mohd Hadzir, 40 told the Magistrate's Court here that even though she was informed the case involved Lew, she had no idea it was pertaining to sexual harassment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I was only informed by the investigating officer DSP Noor Ashikin Shamsuri that the case involved Ebit Lew," she told counsel Ram Singh during cross-examination at the preacher’s sexual harassment trial on Thursday (Sept 29)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Salwani said she had typed in Section 509 of the Penal Code on a set of three photographs of the handphone and SIM card that she seized from Mohd Fairuz Abu on Oct 5, 2021 at his house in Alor Setar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salwani, the Staff Officer of the Kedah Police Contingent Headquarters Criminal Investigation Department’s Women and Children Section, agreed with the defence counsel that when she seized the handphone from Mohd Fairuz, she knew it contained relevant matters with regards to a Tenom case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salwani testified further that said she had read news articles on the accused via social media before she went to Mohd Fairuz's house to seize his handphone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During re-examination, the police officer said she did not inspect the contents of the seized phone as each case material is required to be sent to the Royal Malaysian Police Forensics Department for analysis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On labeling the set of photographs of the seized handphone and SIM card with Section 509 of the Penal Code, Salwani said she typed it out when delivering the seized items to the investigating officer at Bukit Aman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked by Deputy Public Prosecutor Nor Azizah Mohamad why Section 509 was typed out, the witness said it was because the investigation being carried out involved that section
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He told the court that the complainant in the case was among several sexual harassment victims to whom his NGO had extended assistance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The charge under Section 509 of the Penal Code provides for a prison sentence of up to five years or a fine, or both, upon conviction

                Thursday, 29 Sep 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ASP Salwani Mohd Hadzir, 40 told the Magistrate's Court here that even though she was informed the case involved Lew, she had no idea it was pertaining to sexual harassment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I was only informed by the investigating officer DSP Noor Ashikin Shamsuri that the case involved Ebit Lew," she told counsel Ram Singh during cross-examination at the preacher’s sexual harassment trial on Thursday (Sept 29)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, Salwani said she had typed in Section 509 of the Penal Code on a set of three photographs of the handphone and SIM card that she seized from Mohd Fairuz Abu on Oct 5, 2021 at his house in Alor Setar
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salwani, the Staff Officer of the Kedah Police Contingent Headquarters Criminal Investigation Department’s Women and Children Section, agreed with the defence counsel that when she seized the handphone from Mohd Fairuz, she knew it contained relevant matters with regards to a Tenom case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Salwani testified further that said she had read news articles on the accused via social media before she went to Mohd Fairuz's house to seize his handphone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During re-examination, the police officer said she did not inspect the contents of the seized phone as each case material is required to be sent to the Royal Malaysian Police Forensics Department for analysis
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On labeling the set of photographs of the seized handphone and SIM card with Section 509 of the Penal Code, Salwani said she typed it out when delivering the seized items to the investigating officer at Bukit Aman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked by Deputy Public Prosecutor Nor Azizah Mohamad why Section 509 was typed out, the witness said it was because the investigation being carried out involved that section
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He told the court that the complainant in the case was among several sexual harassment victims to whom his NGO had extended assistance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The charge under Section 509 of the Penal Code provides for a prison sentence of up to five years or a fine, or both, upon conviction
            </p>

                Wan Aizuddin showed this purported letter during Najib's trial over the misappropriation of RM2.28 billion of 1Malaysia Development Berhad's (1MDB) funds, as part of the defence's attempt to show that the millions of US dollars which had entered Najib's personal bank account in the past had allegedly originated from gifts from Saudi royalty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The contents of the purported letter to Najib that was read out also included the remark that Najib will have absolute discretion to decide how to use the gift and that the gift was merely a "token gesture" by the purported Saudi prince
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The November 2011 letter shown by Wan Aizuddin in court today was virtually identical in wording to a February 1, 2011 letter from the same purported figure who had promised to give US$100 million as a gift to Najib, with the difference mostly being only the date and the amount and details on how the money would allegedly be given
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The November 2011 letter carried the same disclaimer that the gift of millions of US dollars to Najib should not be seen as an act of corruption
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Aizuddin tried to suggest that six transactions of money that flowed into Najib's personal AmIslamic account ending 9694 from November 2011 to November 2012 would all be covered under the purported promised gift of US$375 million from the alleged Saudi prince
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wan Aizuddin then suggested that mathematically, the total sum of the six transactions would not exceed the US$375 million amount, with Yap then agreeing to this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Wan Aizuddin also tried to suggest that the purported promised gift of US$100 million would explain the inflow of two transactions of US$10 million each from Prince Faisal to Najib's account on February 24, 2011 (equivalent to RM30,449,929.97) and June 14, 2011 (equivalent to RM 30,179,909.46)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Wan Aizuddin also suggested that those two transactions of US$10 million in February and June 2011, and a US$49,999,988 from the Ministry of Finance Riyadh on August 18, 2011 would all be covered by the letter for the purported "personal gift or donation" of US$100 million, but Yap said he would not know as he does not deal directly with the client and that the best person to check with on this would be Yu who was the relationship manager at the bank handling Najib's accounts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yap today said that before he carried out the conversions of US dollar into ringgit Malaysia for the two US$10 million transactions in 2011, he had already known that the AmPrivate Banking-MR account is Najib's account as Yu had informed him of this
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yap said the reason that he was told of the account holder's identity as being Najib was to enable him to correctly capture the transaction into the bank's system and also because it was a "sensitive" bank account "so that we don't easily talk too much about the transaction"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib's lawyers had since yesterday been trying to show that money which came into Najib's account are instead linked to the purported gifts from the Saudi royal family

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The action comes after bailiffs acting for the Sulu Sultan seized Petronas Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz) Sàrl and Petronas South Caucasus Sàrl in Luxembourg, both of which belong to Petronas, to satisfy a US$14.92 billion (RM66.4 billion in mid-July) award by the Spanish arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa

            <p>
                To recap, the legal dispute erupted after the eight heirs of the late Sulu Sultan initiated international arbitration proceedings against the government of Malaysia in end-January 2018 in Madrid, based on an 1878 agreement between Sultan Mohamet Jamal Al Alam (the Sultan of Sulu then) and Baron de Overbeck and Alfred Dent, which granted perpetual sovereign rights over what is parts of Sabah today, in return for an annual RM5,300 token payment

            <p>
                Malaysia claims the militants are linked to the Sultan of Sulu, but the heirs dispute this claim.  Petronas’ 51% unit shipping company MISC Bhd also has several companies in the Netherlands, which hold some of its assets

                (Bloomberg) -- Porsche AG is set for a bullish trading debut after parent Volkswagen AG set the final listing price for the sports-car maker at the upper limit, seeking to defy deep market upheaval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Porsche is a mature, well-known business that doesn’t need to raise capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s listing is set to be the largest in Europe since miner Glencore Plc raised almost $10 billion in a London IPO in 2011, the data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The share price puts Porsche at a valuation that’s not far from VW’s total market capitalization -- a business that comprises Audi, Skoda, Seat, and the VW brand, among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen divided Porsche’s share capital into equal parts voting and non-voting shares, with the German carmaker retaining 75% ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rowe Price and ADQ have together committed to take up as much as 3.7 billion euros of the IPO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other 12.5% of total shares up for grabs is going directly to VW’s largest shareholders –- the billionaire Porsche and Piech family –- via their investment company Porsche Automobil Holding SE
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family already owns a 53% majority of VW’s voting shares, and under the IPO terms, they will also get 25% plus 1 share of Porsche AG’s voting stock, paying a small premium to preferred shares for a total of 10.1 billion euros
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche is targeting revenue of as much as 39 billion euros this year and return on sales of as much as 18%, up two percentage points from last year, the company said in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s Luxury IPO Pitch Meets Investor Concern Over Valuation Besides the byzantine ownership structure, governance is another issue for some investors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to an analysis from Bernstein, Porsche’s market capitalization should sit at 80 billion euros – just below luxury companies but at the higher end of carmakers

                (Bloomberg) -- Porsche AG is set for a bullish trading debut after parent Volkswagen AG set the final listing price for the sports-car maker at the upper limit, seeking to defy deep market upheaval
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Porsche is a mature, well-known business that doesn’t need to raise capital
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s listing is set to be the largest in Europe since miner Glencore Plc raised almost $10 billion in a London IPO in 2011, the data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The share price puts Porsche at a valuation that’s not far from VW’s total market capitalization -- a business that comprises Audi, Skoda, Seat, and the VW brand, among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen divided Porsche’s share capital into equal parts voting and non-voting shares, with the German carmaker retaining 75% ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rowe Price and ADQ have together committed to take up as much as 3.7 billion euros of the IPO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other 12.5% of total shares up for grabs is going directly to VW’s largest shareholders –- the billionaire Porsche and Piech family –- via their investment company Porsche Automobil Holding SE
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family already owns a 53% majority of VW’s voting shares, and under the IPO terms, they will also get 25% plus 1 share of Porsche AG’s voting stock, paying a small premium to preferred shares for a total of 10.1 billion euros
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche is targeting revenue of as much as 39 billion euros this year and return on sales of as much as 18%, up two percentage points from last year, the company said in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s Luxury IPO Pitch Meets Investor Concern Over Valuation Besides the byzantine ownership structure, governance is another issue for some investors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to an analysis from Bernstein, Porsche’s market capitalization should sit at 80 billion euros – just below luxury companies but at the higher end of carmakers
            </p>

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Sept 29 — A one-month jail imposed by the High Court on Datuk Lokman Noor Adam for contempt of court is insufficient and should be increased to protect the dignity of the administration of justice, the Court of Appeal heard today

            <p>
                On July 15, the Kuala Lumpur High Court sentenced Lokman to a one-month jail after finding him guilty of contempt of court for intimidating a witness in former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witness was Najib’s former special officer Datuk Amhari Efendi Nazaruddin, the key witness in the case
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The contemnor further quoted some of the evidence presented in court and manipulated it in the police report to paint the picture that Najib was victimised by Amhari Efendi
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “A police report lodged by my client against the witness cannot be subject to contempt

            <p>
                How can this be intimidation?” the lawyer said in Lokman’s appeal against his conviction and sentence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lokman also lost his two appeals in the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court to overturn the High Court’s ruling
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas had initiated the committal proceeding against Lokman to seek an order for Lokman to be committed to prison or be fined for his action
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Thomas, on September 25, 2019, Lokman uttered words in a video interview that constituted an express or implied threat against Amhari Efendi for having given evidence in the former prime minister’s trial at the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas said that on the same day, Lokman lodged a police report against Amhari Efendi in respect of the evidence given by him at the trial

            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to Thomas, on September 25, 2019, Lokman uttered words in a video interview that constituted an express or implied threat against Amhari Efendi for having given evidence in the former prime minister’s trial at the High Court
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thomas said that on the same day, Lokman lodged a police report against Amhari Efendi in respect of the evidence given by him at the trial

            <p>
                On July 15, the Kuala Lumpur High Court sentenced Lokman to a month's jail after finding him guilty of contempt of court for intimidating a witness in former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak's 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) trial

            <p>
                "The contemnor further quoted some of the evidence presented in court and manipulated it in the police report to paint the picture that Najib was victimised by Amhari Efendi

            <p>
                Lokman also lost his two appeals in the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court to overturn the High Court’s ruling

                (Bloomberg) -- Porsche AG is set for a bullish trading debut after parent Volkswagen AG set the final listing price for the sports-car maker at the upper limit, seeking to defy deep market upheaval

            <p>
                Porsche’s listing is set to be the largest in Europe since miner Glencore Plc raised almost $10 billion in a London IPO in 2011, the data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The share price puts Porsche at a valuation that’s not far from VW’s total market capitalization -- a business that comprises Audi, Skoda, Seat, and the VW brand, among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen divided Porsche’s share capital into equal parts voting and non-voting shares, with the German carmaker retaining 75% ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rowe Price and ADQ have together committed to take up as much as 3.7 billion euros of the IPO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other 12.5% of total shares up for grabs is going directly to VW’s largest shareholders –- the billionaire Porsche and Piech family –- via their investment company Porsche Automobil Holding SE
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family already owns a 53% majority of VW’s voting shares, and under the IPO terms, they will also get 25% plus 1 share of Porsche AG’s voting stock, paying a small premium to preferred shares for a total of 10.1 billion euros
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche is targeting revenue of as much as 39 billion euros this year and return on sales of as much as 18%, up two percentage points from last year, the company said in July

            <p>
                According to an analysis from Bernstein, Porsche’s market capitalization should sit at 80 billion euros – just below luxury companies but at the higher end of carmakers

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s listing is set to be the largest in Europe since miner Glencore Plc raised almost $10 billion in a London IPO in 2011, the data showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The share price puts Porsche at a valuation that’s not far from VW’s total market capitalization -- a business that comprises Audi, Skoda, Seat, and the VW brand, among others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Volkswagen divided Porsche’s share capital into equal parts voting and non-voting shares, with the German carmaker retaining 75% ownership
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rowe Price and ADQ have together committed to take up as much as 3.7 billion euros of the IPO
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The other 12.5% of total shares up for grabs is going directly to VW’s largest shareholders –- the billionaire Porsche and Piech family –- via their investment company Porsche Automobil Holding SE
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The family already owns a 53% majority of VW’s voting shares, and under the IPO terms, they will also get 25% plus 1 share of Porsche AG’s voting stock, paying a small premium to preferred shares for a total of 10.1 billion euros
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche is targeting revenue of as much as 39 billion euros this year and return on sales of as much as 18%, up two percentage points from last year, the company said in July
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Porsche’s Luxury IPO Pitch Meets Investor Concern Over Valuation Besides the byzantine ownership structure, governance is another issue for some investors
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to an analysis from Bernstein, Porsche’s market capitalization should sit at 80 billion euros – just below luxury companies but at the higher end of carmakers

                The move, one of the legal steps Russia says will lead to formal annexation of 15% of Ukraine's territory, confirms that Putin is doubling down on his war against Ukraine despite suffering a major military reversal this month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The annexation, after what Kyiv and Western countries say were phoney referendums staged at gunpoint on Russian-held Ukrainian territory, has been rejected in the West as an illegal seizure of land captured in war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Washington and the European Union are set to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the plan, and even some of Russia's close traditional allies, such as Serbia and Kazakhstan, say they will not recognise the annexation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin's annexation ceremony will be held in one of the Kremlin's grandest halls with the pro-Russian figures Moscow considers to be leaders of the four Ukrainian regions -- Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After days of speculation over exactly how Russia would mark the annexation, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed some details of the ceremony on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin would deliver a major speech on the subject, he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He did so at a similar event in 2014 after Russia proclaimed it had annexed Ukraine's Crimea region
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin publicly backed the annexation plans in a speech last week in which he also announced the call-up of hundreds of thousands of Russian reservists, and warned he could use nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory if necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Russia's Defence Ministry said a day earlier that a Ukrainian offensive on Lyman had failed, with 70 Ukrainian soldiers killed

            <p>
                NUCLEAR UMBRELLA Russian government officials have said that the four regions will fall under Moscow's nuclear umbrella once they have been formally incorporated into Russia

                Moscow's planned annexation of 15% of Ukraine's territory, after what Kyiv and Western countries say were phoney referendums staged at gunpoint in Russian-occupied areas, shows Putin doubling down on his war despite suffering a major reversal on the battlefield this month and discontent at home over a widely criticised partial military mobilisation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin said that "all mistakes" made in a call-up to reinforce Russia's military operation in Ukraine should be corrected, his first public acknowledgment that the "partial mobilisation" he announced last week had not gone smoothly

                Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia's votes were a sham and a "futile attempt to mask attempted land grab in Ukraine." Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan pressed Putin in a call to take steps to reduce tensions in Ukraine

                A tribune has already been set up on the Moscow square with giant video screens and billboards proclaiming "Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson - Russia!"

                In a report published Tuesday, the ratings agency projected that euro zone growth will stall in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023, with growth for the year only reaching 0.3%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                is already in the midst of a "moderate four-quarter recession that started in the second quarter," as households face inflation running at 9.9% and expected to rise further over the winter, quashing consumer spending over the coming quarters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Fiscal support measures deployed by the government, notably the upper limit set on typical household energy bills ("Energy Price Guarantee"), will significantly protect household budgets from an even greater inflation squeeze over the winter," S&P Regional Credit Conditions Chair Paul Watters said in the report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This, along with ongoing resilience of the labor market, are the main reasons we do not expect the U.K
            </p>
            
            <p>
                economy to perform worse." However, Watters noted that inflationary pressures are not confined to retail energy prices, and the plunging pound will further drive up the price of imported goods while domestic price pressures remain elevated, with core inflation — excluding volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices — still above 6%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The suite of policy measures included tax cuts and energy subsidies to households and businesses estimated to cost a minimum 9% of GDP through 2026, and the Bank of England responded by reiterating its commitment to further monetary policy tightening in order to rein in sky-high inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The concern for the gilts market is that nearly all of that 6% of GDP [the emergency energy support] will be funded via new debt, during a period when the BOE is shrinking its balance sheet, and sterling depreciation is adding to inflationary pressures," the S&P report added

                In a report published Tuesday, the ratings agency projected that euro zone growth will stall in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023, with growth for the year only reaching 0.3%

                is already in the midst of a "moderate four-quarter recession that started in the second quarter," as households face inflation running at 9.9% and expected to rise further over the winter, quashing consumer spending over the coming quarters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Fiscal support measures deployed by the government, notably the upper limit set on typical household energy bills ("Energy Price Guarantee"), will significantly protect household budgets from an even greater inflation squeeze over the winter," S&P Regional Credit Conditions Chair Paul Watters said in the report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This, along with ongoing resilience of the labor market, are the main reasons we do not expect the U.K

            <p>
                economy to perform worse." However, Watters noted that inflationary pressures are not confined to retail energy prices, and the plunging pound will further drive up the price of imported goods while domestic price pressures remain elevated, with core inflation — excluding volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices — still above 6%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The suite of policy measures included tax cuts and energy subsidies to households and businesses estimated to cost a minimum 9% of GDP through 2026, and the Bank of England responded by reiterating its commitment to further monetary policy tightening in order to rein in sky-high inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The concern for the gilts market is that nearly all of that 6% of GDP [the emergency energy support] will be funded via new debt, during a period when the BOE is shrinking its balance sheet, and sterling depreciation is adding to inflationary pressures," the S&P report added

                By Indradip Ghosh BENGALURU (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve will hike its key interest rate to a much higher peak than predicted two weeks ago and the risks are skewed towards an even higher terminal rate, according to economists polled by Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But that is unlikely to push the Fed to switch its policy path anytime soon as Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers have remained blunt about the "pain" to come
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Indeed, over 70% of economists, 59 of 83, predicted the central bank would hike its fed funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight meeting in November, a Reuters poll taken after the Fed meeting last week showed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The forecasts are in line with the Fed's dot-plot projection and current market pricing

                Fidelity Investments plans to launch a new product next year that will allow individuals to shift a portion of their employer-sponsored retirement plan into an annuity

            <p>
                The offering, called Guaranteed Income Direct, will enable participants of 401(k) and 403(b) plans to convert their retirement savings into a guaranteed stream of retirement income akin to pension payouts

                Plan participants will have the ability to convert any amount of retirement savings into an annuity that will function like a “personal pension,” the company said

            <p>
                Any money that is not converted into an annuity can remain in the workplace savings plan

            <p>
                This proliferation of annuities within retirement plans is a byproduct of the SECURE Act, the comprehensive retirement legislation signed into law in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fidelity Investments will roll out its own annuity option in 2022 that will allow participants of 401(k)s and 403(b)s to convert their retirement savings into guaranteed streams of lifetime income

                Creating reliable streams of retirement income is one of the most important elements of a person’s financial plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fidelity Investments plans to launch a new product next year that will allow individuals to shift a portion of their employer-sponsored retirement plan into an annuity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The offering, called Guaranteed Income Direct, will enable participants of 401(k) and 403(b) plans to convert their retirement savings into a guaranteed stream of retirement income akin to pension payouts
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you determine whether an annuity is an appropriate investment option for you
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Plan participants will have the ability to convert any amount of retirement savings into an annuity that will function like a “personal pension,” the company said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any money that is not converted into an annuity can remain in the workplace savings plan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This proliferation of annuities within retirement plans is a byproduct of the SECURE Act, the comprehensive retirement legislation signed into law in 2019
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fidelity Investments will roll out its own annuity option in 2022 that will allow participants of 401(k)s and 403(b)s to convert their retirement savings into guaranteed streams of lifetime income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can help you determine whether they should be part of your plan for retirement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tips for Managing Your Retirement Savings Are you saving enough? Experts say your expenses in retirement will be about 80% of what they were prior to retiring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A financial advisor can be a trusted partner as you plan for retirement, helping you determine what your needs will be and how to meet them

                The alarm in Malaysia has now rung loud and clear after a 23-year-old Malaysian citizen named Goi Zhen Feng became Malaysia’s first recorded death from overseas job scams
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goi, a teacher in training, was supposedly held in Myawaddy, Myanmar, which borders Mae Sot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But who runs these syndicates? What do they want and how do they lure thousands of people to fall straight into their trap? How many people are actually being held captive overseas and what is the government’s stand on the issue? Let Malay Mail break it down for you
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A victim who was named as Eric reportedly said he was brought to a rural place in Cambodia and was given a mobile phone to work for a telephone scam company
            </p>
            
            <p>
                How many Malaysians have fallen victim to these scams? Officially, the police’s secretary Datuk Noorsiah Mohd Saaduddin said on August 19 that a total of 238 Malaysians have fallen victim to overseas job scam syndicates between 2021 and then, with 168 in the clutches of these gangs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Special Functions) Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad also told the press on September 20 that an exact number of victims could not be ascertained as only about half of the cases have been reported to the police, making authorities unable to put an exact number of Malaysian victims who have fallen into the syndicate’s trap
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “On each floor there were about 300 people, mostly Malaysians
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The victim named Eric also shared that he was kept at a 13-storey building resembling a hotel and there were 10 groups consisting of 10 people or more for each group at each floor of the building
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Goi’s death was the push needed for Putrajaya to put this matter on the top of their list, after a memorandum was sent to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to seek the government’s assistance and intervention in the job scam issue abroad with Malaysians as the victims were sent in by a group of NGOs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He then instructed Dr Abdul Latiff to take charge of the matter, and on September 20, the special functions minister said that he would bring up the job scam issue involving Malaysian victims abroad to Cabinet after chairing a meeting with Goi’s family and the NGOs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On September 27, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Abdullah chaired a coordination meeting with government agencies to refine, frame, monitor and implement action concerning job scam syndicate cases involving Malaysian citizens abroad

                Goi’s death was the push needed for Putrajaya to put this matter on the top of their list, after a memorandum was sent to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob to seek the government’s assistance and intervention in the job scam issue abroad with Malaysians as the victims were sent in by a group of NGOs

                He then instructed Dr Abdul Latiff to take charge of the matter, and on September 20, the special functions minister said that he would bring up the job scam issue involving Malaysian victims abroad to Cabinet after chairing a meeting with Goi’s family and the NGOs

                The letter said the gift was in appreciation of Najib’s new ideas as a modern Islamic leader and also in view of the friendship the two had developed over the years

                Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the decision, the latest in Malaysia’s continued relaxation of Covid-19 rules, took into consideration the country’s improving Covid-19 situation as well as better aircraft practices and technology

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Health Ministry dental officer Dr Taufik Firdaus – who acted as the lead raiding officer – said a preliminary investigation found that the beautician, who denied having any helper, was not registered with the Malaysian Dental Council
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The small cockroach-infested premises that she was operating from was also found to be unregistered

            <p>
                that the premises has been providing illegal dental treatments, hence we conducted our investigation before the raid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We found dental materials that can be used as evidence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Section 4(1) states that no person shall establish, maintain, operate or provide a private medical clinic or private dental clinic unless it is registered under Section 27
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the 36-year-old beautician, who remained calm during the operation, claimed that she acquired her skills from an Indonesian woman who also provided a one-day course
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It cost me about RM3,600 for a day course
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Also, many are doing it (providing veneer services) so I tried it myself just so that I could earn money as a single mother
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I know it is wrong, but many are doing it, so what’s the issue if I want to look for pocket money?” she said, adding that she was doing it as a part-time job

                Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming of Universiti Malaya said life expectancy was an indication of how long on average people can expect to live if the age-specific mortality rates of that year remained constant for the remainder of their lives
            </p>
            
            <p>

                She was commenting on Malaysia’s average life expectancy at birth which has gone down from 74.4 years in 2012 to 73.4 years in 2022 due to the increase in the number of excess deaths during the pandemic
            </p>

                Among Asean countries in 2021, Malaysia now has a lower life expectancy than Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and Vietnam

            <p>
                In a recent statement, the Department of Statistics Malaysia said the reduction in life expectancy was found among men and women for Malaysians and non-Malaysians in the country

            <p>
                The statistics of life expectancy in this country have been recording a drop since 2020, partly contributed by the excess deaths during the pandemic.Based on the statistics, Malaysian women are expected to live longer than men, with a difference of 4.5 years in 2022

                CRISTIANO RONALDO'S sister Katia Aveiro has leapt to his defence after he was slammed by Portugal fans following the 1-0 loss to Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Katia rejected the backlash and accused the fans of being cruel and ungrateful while claiming Ronaldo receives little support and is still the "best player in the world"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will always be by his side, no matter what
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Portuguese spit on the plate they eat [from], it has always been that way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It is necessary to give a hand to those who have always given theirs to Portugal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Portuguese are sick, petty, soulless, stupid, ungrateful and forever ungrateful
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This guy who's sitting, he's on his knees… There's no one to give him a hand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The one sitting is called Cristiano Ronaldo and he is just the best player in the world." Katia was in attendance at the Braga Municpial Stadium supporting Ronaldo alongside his Spanish girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo even played through the pain barrier after sustaining a cut on his nose and a black eye in Portugal's previous game against the Czech Republic

                CRISTIANO RONALDO'S sister Katia Aveiro has leapt to his defence after he was slammed by Portugal fans following the 1-0 loss to Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Katia rejected the backlash and accused the fans of being cruel and ungrateful while claiming Ronaldo receives little support and is still the "best player in the world"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They will always be by his side, no matter what
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Portuguese spit on the plate they eat [from], it has always been that way
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It is necessary to give a hand to those who have always given theirs to Portugal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Portuguese are sick, petty, soulless, stupid, ungrateful and forever ungrateful
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This guy who's sitting, he's on his knees… There's no one to give him a hand
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The one sitting is called Cristiano Ronaldo and he is just the best player in the world." Katia was in attendance at the Braga Municpial Stadium supporting Ronaldo alongside his Spanish girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo even played through the pain barrier after sustaining a cut on his nose and a black eye in Portugal's previous game against the Czech Republic

                SFA officers were on June 8 alerted by ICA to luggage that was found to contain assorted meat products at Changi Airport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chinese national Wang Liansheng, 68, was fined $17,500 on Thursday for illegally importing assorted meat products into Singapore, said the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA)

            <p>
                On June 8, SFA officers were alerted by ICA to luggage that was found to contain assorted meat products at Changi Airport
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The eight pieces of luggage, which belonged to Wang, contained 226kg of frozen meat products such as chicken, beef, pork, mutton and rabbit meat from China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In another case, Singaporean Tan Kay Huat, 74, was fined $2,000 on Thursday for illegally importing fresh vegetables for sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                SFA said its officers had on March 22 inspected a Malaysian lorry carrying food produce consigned to Tan and Chng Vegetable Seeds and Enterprise at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                SFA said food imports must meet its requirements, fruits and vegetables can be imported only by licensed importers, and every consignment must be declared and accompanied by a valid import permit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The long-term ingestion of excessive pesticide residues through the consumption of vegetables that have been subjected to pesticide abuse could lead to adverse health effects." SFA added that meat products can be imported only from accredited sources in approved countries that comply with Singapore's food safety standards and requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Offenders who import meat products illegally from unapproved sources can be fined $50,000, jailed for up to two years, or both

            </p>
            
            <p>
                In another case, Singaporean Tan Kay Huat, 74, was fined $2,000 on Thursday for illegally importing fresh vegetables for sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                SFA said its officers had on March 22 inspected a Malaysian lorry carrying food produce consigned to Tan and Chng Vegetable Seeds and Enterprise at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                SFA said food imports must meet its requirements, fruits and vegetables can be imported only by licensed importers, and every consignment must be declared and accompanied by a valid import permit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The long-term ingestion of excessive pesticide residues through the consumption of vegetables that have been subjected to pesticide abuse could lead to adverse health effects." SFA added that meat products can be imported only from accredited sources in approved countries that comply with Singapore's food safety standards and requirements
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Offenders who import meat products illegally from unapproved sources can be fined $50,000, jailed for up to two years, or both

                LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Biogen and Eisai soared on Wednesday reflecting the surprise trial success of their experimental Alzheimer's drug, which also lifted the stocks of rival drugmakers Roche and Eli Lilly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Against the odds, Biogen and Eisai on Tuesday said their experimental drug, lecanemab, slowed progress of the brain-wasting disease by 27% compared with a placebo, in a large trial of patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's

            <p>
                Biogen's stock surged 50% in early premarket trading

            <p>
                Shares of Roche, which is expected to report results on a rival Alzheimer's drug gantenerumab later this year, jumped as much as 6% to a two-month high in early trading

                LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Biogen and Eisai soared on Wednesday reflecting the surprise trial success of their experimental Alzheimer's drug, which also lifted the stocks of rival drugmakers Roche and Eli Lilly

            <p>
                Against the odds, Biogen and Eisai on Tuesday said their experimental drug, lecanemab, slowed progress of the brain-wasting disease by 27% compared with a placebo, in a large trial of patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's

                Shares of Roche, which is expected to report results on a rival Alzheimer's drug gantenerumab later this year, jumped as much as 6% to a two-month high in early trading

                Liverpool forward Diogo Jota was far better than Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo for Portugal last night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s according to Goal, who claim that the Liverpool man was ‘full of enterprise’ throughout the 1-0 loss to Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Starting on the left of Portugal’s forward line, Jota is said to have been his team’s ‘most potent attacking threat.’ One ball in particular for Ronaldo is described as being ‘scintillating’ but the United man couldn’t capitalise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regardless of the Ronaldo stuff, this is really great to hear from a Liverpool point of view
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jota hasn’t really been able to get going so far this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given a surprise start by Jurgen Klopp against Ajax, Jota was a constant threat as Liverpool won 2-1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although he wasn’t able to find the net last night, it sounds as though that wasn’t for a lack of quality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the fixture list now chock full until the World Cup in Novemeber, Liverpool need Jota badly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It looks like we can finally expect to see the player who lit up the first half of last season once again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Darwin Nunez on the scoresheet for Uruguay last night, Klopp has a decision to make ahead of Saturday’s game with Brighton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Nunez and Jota have enjoyed a good time away with their country’s

                Liverpool forward Diogo Jota was far better than Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo for Portugal last night
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s according to Goal, who claim that the Liverpool man was ‘full of enterprise’ throughout the 1-0 loss to Spain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Starting on the left of Portugal’s forward line, Jota is said to have been his team’s ‘most potent attacking threat.’ One ball in particular for Ronaldo is described as being ‘scintillating’ but the United man couldn’t capitalise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regardless of the Ronaldo stuff, this is really great to hear from a Liverpool point of view
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jota hasn’t really been able to get going so far this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Given a surprise start by Jurgen Klopp against Ajax, Jota was a constant threat as Liverpool won 2-1
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although he wasn’t able to find the net last night, it sounds as though that wasn’t for a lack of quality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the fixture list now chock full until the World Cup in Novemeber, Liverpool need Jota badly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It looks like we can finally expect to see the player who lit up the first half of last season once again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With Darwin Nunez on the scoresheet for Uruguay last night, Klopp has a decision to make ahead of Saturday’s game with Brighton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both Nunez and Jota have enjoyed a good time away with their country’s

                Former Manchester United chief Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made some bold decisions in the transfer market before he was sacked last year, and Erik ten Hag is now reaping the rewards Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag oversaw a record transfer spree at Old Trafford this summer, but the Dutchman could have had plenty more work on his hands were it not for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ten Hag splashed out more than £231million to bring in six new faces following his arrival from Ajax earlier this year - the most Manchester United have ever spent in a single transfer window
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Solskjaer decided against offloading five United stars who were tipped for the exit last summer; Donny van de Beek, Diogo Dalot, Anthony Elanga, Anthony Martial and Edinson Cavani
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And although that quintet failed to make much of an impression last term, the majority are now firmly in Ten Hag's plans
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are even suggestions that Dalot is in line for a new contract after impressing Ten Hag - who would have been forced to rely on Wan-Bissaka had Solskjaer not blocked the Portuguese defender's exit last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elanga has continued to progress under Ten Hag after his breakthrough year under Rangnick last term and has now established himself as a legitimate member of the first-team squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Solskjaer's decision to hang onto Van De Beek could still benefit Ten Hag, who quickly identified midfield as an area of the squad in need of improvement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Had Van De Beek been allowed to depart, then the new United chief would have been even lighter on midfield options
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Van De Beek flourished under Ten Hag's guidance during his time at Ajax, where he initially caught the Man United hierarchy's eye
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And there is every chance that the 25-year-old could still force his way back into the first-team frame at Old Trafford in the coming weeks with his old boss at the helm - even if Ten Hag's arrival has failed to spark an instant improvement in the playmaker's fortunes

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 28 — In a growing wave of protest, more and more people have joined in the call to stop the Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022’s Generational End Game (GEG)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The GEG mandates against the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products to those born from the year 2007 onwards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the biggest issue — even among anti-smokers — is GEG’s impact on the consumer’s legal right to choose
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although the State does limit these abilities through an age prerequisite, it acts as a temporary gatekeeper as opposed to the Bill’s permanent prohibition with the GEG.” Datuk Seri Panglima Wilfred Madius Tangau, the Tuaran MP and a member of the Parliamentary Special Select Committee (PSSC) responsible for reviewing the GEG, highlighted his concerns in a series of tweets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said, “As a member of the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022, I have raised the constitutionality of the Bill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Will the Bill survive a constitutional legal challenge from those born in 2007? “The question is should a constitutional legal challenge be initiated especially by those born in 2007 and after, and if they (are successful) to get the court to declare that the Bill is unconstitutional then the drafting and tabling of the Bill will be a waste of time.” The tweet seems to point to the fact that the PSSC is divided over the controversial GEG proposal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is only one more week left before Parliament recommences and the Bill tabled again to the lawmakers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a poll conducted by a local think-tank, 86 per cent of the over 150 retailers surveyed said that the GEG “would add complexity to their business.” What is more, they believe the GEG will not stop smoking as these young people will either resort to illegal cigarettes (89 per cent), get someone “legitimate” to purchase cigarettes for them (70 per cent), or perhaps turn to other dangerous substances such as drugs (34 per cent)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They urged the government to address concerns related to the GEG, which they said can impact their livelihood
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A comprehensive consultation, briefing and impact study should be carried out with retailers to improve the GEG Bill.” J
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Therefore, we (retailers) automatically become the frontliners in the implementation of the GEG Bill.” “Let’s not forget the issue of asking for identity cards (MyKad)

                Will the Bill survive a constitutional legal challenge from those born in 2007? “The question is should a constitutional legal challenge be initiated especially by those born in 2007 and after, and if they (are successful) to get the court to declare that the Bill is unconstitutional then the drafting and tabling of the Bill will be a waste of time.” The tweet seems to point to the fact that the PSSC is divided over the controversial GEG proposal

                Eric added that he did not think twice about the offer because he trusted his friend

                When he asked his friend (from Sarawak) about it, the latter told him that he would be traveling to Thailand by car from Cambodia

            <p>
                The first contact between Eric and Phoong was on August 9 where Eric also shared his exact location

                Eric said that he escaped from the place during a police and immigration raid, which was held a few days ago

            <p>
                Phoong said that Eric was using a Cambodian number starting with 855
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Phoong also said that he again received a text message from Eric on September 19 who informed him that there was a police raid and a lot of people were running
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Eric managed to escape on the 24th,” he said

                Eric added that he did not think twice about the offer because he trusted his friend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When he asked his friend (from Sarawak) about it, the latter told him that he would be traveling to Thailand by car from Cambodia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Eric said that he was given a handphone in his last place of work in Cambodia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first contact between Eric and Phoong was on August 9 where Eric also shared his exact location
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Eric said that he escaped from the place during a police and immigration raid, which was held a few days ago
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Eric explained that he managed to contact his friend to ask him to book a flight for him from Cambodia to Kuala Lumpur
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Phoong said that Eric was using a Cambodian number starting with 855
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Phoong also said that he again received a text message from Eric on September 19 who informed him that there was a police raid and a lot of people were running
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Eric managed to escape on the 24th,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that Eric’s aunt made the police report with the help of DAP liaison officer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When Eric returned to Malaysia, Phoong urged him to share his story with other Sabahans because it was unheard of in Sabah

                For the record, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (MACC Act or Act 694) provides for a maximum jail term of 20 years

                In essence, he is much the same player as the one Liverpool fans were eager to sign four years ago, but now with far more experience at the top level

                Pulisic has spent more time on the right, but as a right-footer he would be in a different mould to Klopp’s typical inverted winger approach

                Mohd Fairuz Abu said that a woman using a pseudonym got in touch with him through WhatsApp after he uploaded a post about a preacher accused of sexual harassment on July 26, 2016
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When I mentioned that it was related to Ebit Lew, the woman shared with me screenshots of her conversation with him, as well as pornographic images (of genitals) sent by him to her via WhatsApp,” he told magistrate Nur Asyraf Zolhani in response to questions from deputy public prosecutor Zahida Zakaria
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The motivational expert, who assisted the victim of sexual harassment involving Ebit Lew, took the witness stand yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Fairuz, 37, said he also sent the screenshots shared by the woman to a man named Firdaus Wong, who he said was handling a similar case involving the accused and another woman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When DPP Zahida asked Mohd Fairuz what action he took after sending the screenshots to Wong, the witness said that on July 27 last year, he telephoned the woman to listen to the full chronology of events with regard to the harassment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ebit Lew is a big personality

                So, I don’t want to lodge a report’.” After he made the suggestion, Mohd Fairuz said the woman asked for some time to discuss it with her husband and that she finally lodged a police report on Aug 7 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Fairuz said he had personally met the woman and was able to identify her in court

                But Gareth Southgate cannot start Harry Maguire if he isn’t starting for Manchester United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Southgate is convinced that he is his best central defender
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Southgate backed him last Thursday, indicating he will start at the World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Southgate clearly believes he needs Maguire if England are to win their first senior men’s trophy since 1966
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I’d say the odds are against him but he was England’s best defender in the last two tournaments, a point not lost on Southgate
            </p>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Can Southgate afford to take such a gamble? The answer to that is ‘no’

            <p>
                James is the best full back in England at the moment and has done nothing to change my mind or indeed Southgate’s over the last week

            <p>
                He ended up being one of England’s key players and Southgate will offer him that opportunity again
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Foden’s England form has not been as good as it can be recently and Southgate is a huge fan of Mount and indeed Saka
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The problem Southgate has is that so many players have been out of form for their clubs, and that was certainly reflected in their performances for England

                CRISTIANO RONALDO "didn't reject" a summer transfer to Al-Hilal, according to the club's president
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But Fahad ben Nafel insisted it was not Ronaldo who pulled the plug
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead, he claimed a transfer ban placed on the Saudi Arabian side proved the critical blow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The problem was not in the money or the principle, Al-Hilal is able to bring in the stars of the world
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "We did not stop negotiating with the players despite the decision to ban, but we were delaying entering the final stage of the negotiations until the ban was lifted.” Ronaldo, 37, looked on course to quit United in the summer after the club failed to qualify for the Champions League with just 12 months left on his Old Trafford contract
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ronaldo has started just once in the Premier League this season - the 4-0 drubbing at Brentford - with Marcus Rashford claiming the No9 spot
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Portugal superstar did get his first goal of the season from the penalty spot as United beat Sheriff 2-0 in the Europa League

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 28 — Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told National Recovery Council (NRC) chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin today to stop complaining about the government’s implementation of the panel’s recommendations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a Facebook post, the Umno president said the government’s implementation of 16 from among the NRC’s recommendations already demonstrated that its views were taken seriously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Therefore, Tan Sri Mahiaddin does not need to complain as if the government has cancelled the role of the NRC or the NRC has failed,” he said, using Muhyiddin’s official name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Meanwhile, the NRC chairman is using the council as a platform to promote his political propaganda,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Muhyiddin said that the government was slow in implementing the NRC’s suggestions, noting that the NRC had submitted 95 suggestions to date — comprising 69 that were related to socio-economic issues and 26 related to governance

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 28 — Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told National Recovery Council (NRC) chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin today to stop complaining about the government’s implementation of the panel’s recommendations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a Facebook post, the Umno president said the government’s implementation of 16 from among the NRC’s recommendations already demonstrated that its views were taken seriously
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Therefore, Tan Sri Mahiaddin does not need to complain as if the government has cancelled the role of the NRC or the NRC has failed,” he said, using Muhyiddin’s official name
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Meanwhile, the NRC chairman is using the council as a platform to promote his political propaganda,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, Muhyiddin said that the government was slow in implementing the NRC’s suggestions, noting that the NRC had submitted 95 suggestions to date — comprising 69 that were related to socio-economic issues and 26 related to governance

                If policymakers take no action, Social Security could still pay 80% of benefits using its tax income

            <p>
                For the average worker, Social Security replaces about 40% of annual savings before retirement, according to the SSA — though that figure varies depending on income

                The average Social Security retirement benefit in August 2022 was $1,627 per month

                Last month, Lantronix reported its fourth and final quarterly results for its fiscal year 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The headline number was a quarterly top line of $35.9 million, a gain of 74% year-over-year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While this EPS came in just under the 9-cent forecast, it was up 33% from the 6-cent result reported in the year-ago quarter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the full fiscal year 2022, Lantronix reported $129.5 million in total revenues, up 81% from the $71.3 million reported in fiscal 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Looking forward, the company is guiding toward $149 million to $162 million in revenues for fiscal 2023; at the midpoint, this would represent a 20% increase from the ’22 total
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The shares are trading for $4.74 and their $12.20 average target suggests ~163% upside in the next 12 months (See Lantronix stock forecast on TipRanks) Universal Display Corporation (OLED) The second stock we’ll look at is Universal Display, a leader in the market for organic light emitting diodes, or OLEDs

            <p>
                They can also be found in lighting systems – and give Universal Display a neat stock ticker into the bargain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Business has been slowing globally, which suppressed demand for Universal Display’s OLED products, and have put near-term weakness on the company’s prospects
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the company reported a 5.4% year-over-year gain in revenues, from $129.7 million in the year-ago quarter to $136.6 million in 2Q22, the figure missed expectations by $14.61 million
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In-line with this upbeat outlook, Searle gives OLED shares a Buy rating and a price target of $208 for the year ahead, implying an upside of 114% for the coming year

                While the company reported a 5.4% year-over-year gain in revenues, from $129.7 million in the year-ago quarter to $136.6 million in 2Q22, the figure missed expectations by $14.61 million

                At his company Icahn Enterprises, the net asset value went up about 30% in the first six months of this year

            <p>
                Icahn’s pick in the energy space is CVR Energy (CVI), which is mainly in the refinery business

            <p>
                He says that the stock “is quite cheap, even though it’s come up a lot.” CVR Energy shares have surged 50% year to date and 74% over the last 12 months
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Q2 of 2022, CVR Energy brought in $3.1 billion of net sales, up from $1.8 billion in the year-ago period

            <p>
                “[The] fertilizer business, to me, is a great business today,” Icahn says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Q2, the partnership’s average realized gate price for UAN shot up 134% year over year to $555 per ton
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For ammonia, the average realized gate price rose 193% year over year to $1,182 per ton

                Unsurprisingly, CVR Partners has been another stellar performer in this ugly market as the stock is up 29% year to date

                Asked by Najib’s lawyer Wan Aizuddin Wan Mohammed if it was normal for a person or a company which has a bank account to appoint a mandate holder, Uma Devi said this would be only in limited situations
            </p>

                “For individual account, no

            <p>
                Uma Devi agreed that a bank branch officer would usually be in charge of contacting the account holder to ask for the confirmation of cheques
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But in situations where there is a relationship manager at the bank directly in charge of handling the accounts — such as for Najib’s bank accounts, Uma Devi said the bank branch would then contact the relationship manager to ask the latter to confirm the cheques with the account holder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Asked by Wan Aizuddin if there would be any breach of banking rules if the relationship manager fails to contact the account holder for cheque confirmation and simply says the bank customer had confirmed the cheques, Uma Devi said there would be a breach but with the bank only knowing if the customer complains
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Yes, if there’s a dispute by the customer, there would be
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Uma Devi then said bank customers should have checked the transactions in the statement of their bank accounts, describing it as a “duty”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the bank, we don’t take that for granted

            <p>
                Uma Devi confirmed she had never seen a remittance amount from a personal bank account larger than this US$620 million sum
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wedani had previously also confirmed an August 21, 2013 letter from Najib to AmIslamic Bank’s Jalan Raja Chulan branch manager, instructing for money to be transferred out from his 9694 account to Tanore’s bank account, and that a sum of over US$620 million was sent from the 9694 account on August 26, 2013 to the Tanore account

                Mohd Fairuz Abu, 37, told the court he was contacted by a woman using a pseudonym via the WhatsApp application after he uploaded a post about a preacher involved in a case of sexual harassment with a woman on Facebook on July 26 last year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "When I mentioned that it was related to Ebit Lew, the woman shared with me screenshots of Ebit Lew's conversation with her, as well as pornographic images (of genitals) sent by Ebit via WhatsApp," he said in front of Magistrate Nur Asyraf Zolhani in response to questions from Deputy Public Prosecutor Zahida Zakaria
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Fairuz said he also sent the screenshots shared by the woman to a man named Firdaus Wong, who he said was handling a similar case involving the accused with another woman
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When Zahida asked Mohd Fairuz what action he took after sending the screenshots to Wong, the witness said that on July 27, 2021, he contacted the woman via a phone call to listen to the full chronology of events with regard to the harassment
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                After he made the suggestion, Mohd Fairuz said the woman asked for some time to discuss it with her husband, and that she finally lodged a police report on Aug 7, 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mohd Fairuz said he had personally met with the woman and was able to identify her in court
            </p>

                The witness also recognised Lew, who was sitting on the witness stand

                He noted that Bank Negara’s press release, which was issued last week on the ringgit, is a testament that the central bank will ensure the domestic foreign exchange market will continue to function orderly, and domestic liquidity remains ample to support the economy
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is important now for the country to continue enhancing its economic and financial resilience, including implementing key reforms to strengthen the fundamental support for and longer term confidence on the ringgit, Lee pointed out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, estimates among analysts vary but on a more optimistic note, stated that global inflation could start ebbing from as early as the end of this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The potential easing in inflation will strengthen the case for global central banks such as the Fed and the European Central Bank to slow down their rate hikes, although the risk is that rate hikes will still continue in the near term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will also then reduce the pressure on Bank Negara to raise interest rates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Nevertheless, the current combination of high inflation and slow economic growth raises the risk of a stagflationary episode,” Kenanga Research said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, underlying price pressures as measured by core inflation continued to trend higher, highlighting that inflation may continue to remain high and would not return to the 2% inflation target anytime soon, despite global central banks’ aggressive rate hikes,” the research house added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Lee said inflation back home may moderate from 2023 due to the projected slower economic growth and domestic demand as well as the high base effect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both direct and indirect impact of the weakening ringgit are also at play,” he noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We estimate the consumer price index to increase by 3.5% in 2022 and an estimated 2.5% to 3% in 2023,” Lee said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This brings inflation year-to-date to 3%

                It is important now for the country to continue enhancing its economic and financial resilience, including implementing key reforms to strengthen the fundamental support for and longer term confidence on the ringgit, Lee pointed out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, estimates among analysts vary but on a more optimistic note, stated that global inflation could start ebbing from as early as the end of this year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The potential easing in inflation will strengthen the case for global central banks such as the Fed and the European Central Bank to slow down their rate hikes, although the risk is that rate hikes will still continue in the near term
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will also then reduce the pressure on Bank Negara to raise interest rates
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Nevertheless, the current combination of high inflation and slow economic growth raises the risk of a stagflationary episode,” Kenanga Research said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “However, underlying price pressures as measured by core inflation continued to trend higher, highlighting that inflation may continue to remain high and would not return to the 2% inflation target anytime soon, despite global central banks’ aggressive rate hikes,” the research house added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Lee said inflation back home may moderate from 2023 due to the projected slower economic growth and domestic demand as well as the high base effect
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both direct and indirect impact of the weakening ringgit are also at play,” he noted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We estimate the consumer price index to increase by 3.5% in 2022 and an estimated 2.5% to 3% in 2023,” Lee said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “This brings inflation year-to-date to 3%

                Describing the issuance of the LOS as 'a first of its kind’ and ‘was done in great speed’, Datuk Siti Zauyah Mohd Desa, 63, said in her 25 years’ experience in the ministry, that was the first time an LOS was issued by the ministry without conducting a due diligence for the project cash flow
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "There was no current assessment on the joint-venture investment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In fact, there was none, nothing for us to do due diligence,” she said during re-examination by senior deputy public prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram in former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s trial for misappropriation of RM2.3bil in funds from1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The US$3bil loan was approved by the government via a support letter signed by Najib, who was Finance Minister back in 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 26th prosecution witness said the projection of cash flow was one of the most important parts in the issuance of LOS for the ministry to assess whether any investment was able to churn out the right kind of income to service the loan
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When asked by Sri Ram why she did not approach Najib herself to air her concerns over the issues surrounding the sovereign wealth fund, Siti Zauyah said she did not have direct access to the then prime minister
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "However, I did approach (then) Finance Minister II (Datuk Seri Ahmad Husni Mohamad Hanadzlah) but he did not want to get involved
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The senior DPP also questioned her about her previous testimony, where the witness said she was instructed by former Treasury secretary-general Tan Sri Dr Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah to continue processing the LOS despite lacking the usual process of conducting due diligence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The trial before judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah continues this afternoon

                Its existence has been made known last month but it is only today that Perodua has officially launched a new version of its highly popular Ativa SUV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Simply called the Ativa Hybrid, it is essentially a Daihatsu Rocky e-Smart Hybrid that was launched in Japan last November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In fact, the model is imported directly from Japan albeit with Perodua and Ativa logos on it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, the Ativa Hybrid is being brought here not to boost Ativa’s sales but more as a test subject for Perodua’s long-term study on mobility as a service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, that is why the Ativa Hybrid is being offered only through a subscription service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard Ativa is already part of the EZ MOBi subscription service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On top of that, Perodua is also studying the driving behaviours of hybrid vehicles in Klang Valley, Penang, and Johor Bharu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the Ativa Hybrid itself, it runs on what Perodua described as a series hybrid system
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Its existence has been made known last month but it is only today that Perodua has officially launched a new version of its highly popular Ativa SUV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Simply called the Ativa Hybrid, it is essentially a Daihatsu Rocky e-Smart Hybrid that was launched in Japan last November
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In fact, the model is imported directly from Japan albeit with Perodua and Ativa logos on it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, the Ativa Hybrid is being brought here not to boost Ativa’s sales but more as a test subject for Perodua’s long-term study on mobility as a service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, that is why the Ativa Hybrid is being offered only through a subscription service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard Ativa is already part of the EZ MOBi subscription service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On top of that, Perodua is also studying the driving behaviours of hybrid vehicles in Klang Valley, Penang, and Johor Bharu
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for the Ativa Hybrid itself, it runs on what Perodua described as a series hybrid system
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Without opening the hood, you can also spot the Ativa Hybrid by its grille and bumper designs which are slightly different from the standard Ativa
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Furthermore, there is no variant label on its bonnet door alongside the Ativa badge

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 27 — The prosecution today rested its case after calling a total of 29 out of 37 witnesses to testify in court against former youth and sports minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman who is accused of misappropriating more than RM1 million as well as criminal breach of trust (CBT)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The witnesses, ranging from Syed Saddiq’s parents and star prosecution witness Rafiq Hakim Razali — who is the former Angkatan Bersatu Anak Muda (Armada) assistant treasurer — to MACC officers and members of Syed Saddiq’s Armada team, took the stand in the trial that spanned 21 days
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During today’s proceedings, Syed Saddiq’s defence counsel Gobind Singh Deo raised an issue in which he pointed out that one of the MACC investigating officers Nurul Hidayah Kamaruddin had not been served or shown the defence’s statements before the trial began
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gobind said Section 62 of the MACC Act 2009 states that the law requires the defence to hand over to the prosecution a statement of defence before the trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this had been done to show that the money raised and used by Syed Saddiq during his campaigning in Muar were for political purposes and not for his personal use, as what the prosecution had alleged
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gobind asked why the investigating officers were not given the defence statement so they could look into the source of Syed Saddiq’s income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gobind said that Syed Saddiq had all the receipts to show his expenditure at the material time in 2018, while also pointing out to the three investigating officers today that he had a steady flow of income from 2011
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When Gobind asked if any of the officers had investigated Syed Saddiq’s sources of income, all of them answered in the negative
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They said they had only investigated what they were told to, nor did they investigate other members of Bersatu to see if they too had also declared their expenditure to Bersatu’s supreme council as they should have
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judicial Commissioner Datuk Azhar Abdul Hamid ruled that Section 62 cannot be tendered by Nurul Hidayah and must be tendered by the defence
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Syed Saddiq, 30, is charged as the then Bersatu youth wing or Armada chief, who was entrusted with control of its funds, with abetting Rafiq Hakim with CBT of RM1mil in funds belonging to the wing at CIMB Bank Bhd, Menara CIMB KL Sentral, Jalan Stesen Sentral 2, here on March 6, 2020

                Apple CEO Tim Cook has recently visited the company’s upcoming new London headquarters located at Battersea Power Station and has provided a sneak peek on Twitter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is a decommissioned coal power station which has been redeveloped by a consortium of Malaysian developers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to a tweet by Tim Cook, they can’t wait to open their new offices in the iconic Battersea Power Station early next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move to Battersea Power Station was reported back in 2016 and it will house around 1,400 employees
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The restored and modernised Battersea Power Station is currently set to open next month on 14th October 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The power station was first opened in 1933 with two chimneys before a near-identical second stage is added which adds another two chimneys to the overall structure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2012, a Malaysian consortium consisting of Sime Darby Berhad, SP Setia Berhad and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) acquired Battersea Power Station for GBP 400 million (about RM1.97 billion)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2019, PNB and EPF completed their acquisition of commercial assets in Phase 2 of Battersea Power Station and it was described to be the most expensive deal in the UK valued at GBP 1.58 billion (RM8.51 billion)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Edge reported last year that the first official Apple Store in Malaysia is said to be located at The Exchange TRX and it could open as early as 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple seems to be putting more emphasis on Malaysia lately

            <p>
                According to a tweet by Tim Cook, they can’t wait to open their new offices in the iconic Battersea Power Station early next year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The move to Battersea Power Station was reported back in 2016 and it will house around 1,400 employees
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The restored and modernised Battersea Power Station is currently set to open next month on 14th October 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The power station was first opened in 1933 with two chimneys before a near-identical second stage is added which adds another two chimneys to the overall structure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2012, a Malaysian consortium consisting of Sime Darby Berhad, SP Setia Berhad and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) acquired Battersea Power Station for GBP 400 million (about RM1.97 billion)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2019, PNB and EPF completed their acquisition of commercial assets in Phase 2 of Battersea Power Station and it was described to be the most expensive deal in the UK valued at GBP 1.58 billion (RM8.51 billion)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Edge reported last year that the first official Apple Store in Malaysia is said to be located at The Exchange TRX and it could open as early as 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apple seems to be putting more emphasis on Malaysia lately

                James Olley explains his reasons for leaving Trent Alexander-Arnold out of his England World Cup squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was never a chance of the Football Association removing Southgate before the World Cup begins in Qatar, but he was on the brink of a new low in his six-year tenure at 2-0 down against Germany in Monday's UEFA Nations League clash at Wembley
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And then England sparked into life, roaring back for an eventual 3-3 finish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sight of one wing-back assisting the other evoked memories of England's fast start to the Euro 2020 final against Italy when Shaw scored after just two minutes, the apotheosis of Southgate's tenure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But this was a night when individual errors undermined England rather than a collective, systemic failure, which Southgate's detractors claim has set in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Southgate's loyalty to Maguire is admirable on a personal level but looks misplaced given the mistakes that have permeated his game for more than a year now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet it is that same trusting trait which enabled the England's squad leadership group, comprising among others Kane, Sterling and Jordan Henderson, to feel comfortable enough to approach Southgate and request a private meeting without staff to address the team's slump in form

                James Olley explains his reasons for leaving Trent Alexander-Arnold out of his England World Cup squad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There was never a chance of the Football Association removing Southgate before the World Cup begins in Qatar, but he was on the brink of a new low in his six-year tenure at 2-0 down against Germany in Monday's UEFA Nations League clash at Wembley
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And then England sparked into life, roaring back for an eventual 3-3 finish
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The sight of one wing-back assisting the other evoked memories of England's fast start to the Euro 2020 final against Italy when Shaw scored after just two minutes, the apotheosis of Southgate's tenure
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But this was a night when individual errors undermined England rather than a collective, systemic failure, which Southgate's detractors claim has set in
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Southgate's loyalty to Maguire is admirable on a personal level but looks misplaced given the mistakes that have permeated his game for more than a year now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet it is that same trusting trait which enabled the England's squad leadership group, comprising among others Kane, Sterling and Jordan Henderson, to feel comfortable enough to approach Southgate and request a private meeting without staff to address the team's slump in form
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Perodua Ativa Hybrid specs   At this juncture you might have noticed that the car looks a little different from the regular Ativa

            <p>
                It’s already well-known that the latter is based on the Daihatsu Rocky, but the Hybrid model is literally a Rocky Hybrid with Perodua and Ativa badges

                The big benefit is fuel consumption — the Hybrid achieves a claimed 28km per litre combined on the WLTP cycle, compared to 20.7km per litre for the standard Rocky, which shares the Ativa’s 1.0-litre mill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Perodua’s (very optimistic) Malaysian Driving Cycle, the car can go up to 31.3 km per litre

                Harry Maguire was at least partially at fault for two of Germany's goals on Monday night Gareth Southgate has continued to stand by Maguire, but he struggled badly at Wembley 'You look at the goals and they were avoidable,' Defoe said on Channel 4.  'Silly mistakes, you give the ball away and then you give away a penalty

                Jermain Defoe thinks Harry Maguire is making far too many 'avoidable' mistakes right now Defoe is aware of the criticism that Maguire has faced, and is rooting for him to get back to his best.  He has called for Maguire to try to play with more freedom so that he can return to the form that saw him shine at the World Cup in 2018, and the Euros last year, when he was named in the Team of the Tournament.  'It's a funny one because like I said at the top of the show, there's been a lot of negativity around him and you want him to play well because he's done well in tournaments for England,' Defoe added.  'We've seen him in the tournaments, he's done well to be honest
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You just want him to take the handbrake off and just play.'

                Jermain Defoe thinks Harry Maguire is making far too many 'avoidable' mistakes right now Defoe is aware of the criticism that Maguire has faced, and is rooting for him to get back to his best.  He has called for Maguire to try to play with more freedom so that he can return to the form that saw him shine at the World Cup in 2018, and the Euros last year, when he was named in the Team of the Tournament.  'It's a funny one because like I said at the top of the show, there's been a lot of negativity around him and you want him to play well because he's done well in tournaments for England,' Defoe added.  'We've seen him in the tournaments, he's done well to be honest

            <p>
                You just want him to take the handbrake off and just play.'

                About Us Advertise LONDON, Sept 27 — Gareth Southgate hopes England will feel the benefit of being put under intense pressure in recent days at the World Cup after fighting back from 2-0 down to salvage a 3-3 draw against Germany on Monday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The knives were being sharpened for Southgate after his faith in Harry Maguire backfired for two German goals early in the second half
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Centre-back Maguire has been publicly backed by the England boss despite being dropped at club level by Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kai Havertz then curled brilliantly into the top corner after Maguire was dispossed in the German half

            <p>
                Yet, there was more drama to come as Nick Pope spilled Serge Gnabry’s shot and Havertz pounced on the rebound to snatch Germany a point
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Relief for Southgate Despite the disappointment of a late equaliser, there was relief for Southgate that England’s attack finally came to life after accusations that his conservative tactics were to blame for a lack of goals
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The whole experience has been what we needed,” said Southgate, who had been booed by England fans after a 1-0 defeat to Italy in Milan on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                Gundogan coolly slotted into the bottom corner and it seemed game over when Havertz arrowed home his shot from outside the box with 23 minutes to go

            <p>
                However, three goals in 11 minutes got the England support back on side and gave the team some impetus to build on heading to Qatar

            <p>
                Any doubt over who Southgate will start in goal against Iran on November 21 appears to over though, as long as Jordan Pickford has recovered from a thigh injury that kept him out of this squad

                A cash tray holding British pound banknotes and coins in a shop in Barking
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The pound’s tumble to as low as US$1.0350 (RM4.78) – fuelled by Kwarteng’s comment on Sunday that there’s “more to come” on tax cuts – has sparked calls for aggressive rate hikes from the Bank of England (BoE), with some analysts urging emergency action as soon as this week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “The pound is a whisker away from parity and the situation is going to only worsen from here.” While some market participants described the pound’s sudden drop in early Asia hours as a flash crash, the currency has held onto most of its losses and derivatives suggest traders are braced for further declines
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The options market now shows about 60% odds of the pound weakening to parity against the dollar this year, up from 32% on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The currency’s selloff began last Friday with the release of the government’s “Growth Plan,” a budget in all but name and the biggest tax giveaway in half a century
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kwarteng scrapped the top level of income tax and cut the basic rate by a percentage point, while also reversing an increase in the National Insurance payroll tax brought in earlier this year
            </p>

                The pound’s tumble to as low as US$1.0350 (RM4.78) – fuelled by Kwarteng’s comment on Sunday that there’s “more to come” on tax cuts – has sparked calls for aggressive rate hikes from the Bank of England (BoE), with some analysts urging emergency action as soon as this week

                “The pound is a whisker away from parity and the situation is going to only worsen from here.” While some market participants described the pound’s sudden drop in early Asia hours as a flash crash, the currency has held onto most of its losses and derivatives suggest traders are braced for further declines

            <p>
                The options market now shows about 60% odds of the pound weakening to parity against the dollar this year, up from 32% on Friday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The currency’s selloff began last Friday with the release of the government’s “Growth Plan,” a budget in all but name and the biggest tax giveaway in half a century
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Kwarteng scrapped the top level of income tax and cut the basic rate by a percentage point, while also reversing an increase in the National Insurance payroll tax brought in earlier this year

                Sudrajad was named a suspect early on Friday for allegedly taking bribes relating to a civil case handled by the Supreme Court, along with nine other people following a series of KPK raids in Jakarta and Semarang in Central Java

                Sudrajad had allegedly accepted 800 million rupiah (RM242,460) in bribes in return for a Supreme Court cassation ruling favouring businessmen Ivan Dwi Kusuma Sujanto and Heryanto Tanaka, who were involved in the civil case battle against Intidana

            <p>
                Pheww put on an incredible performance on the off-meta hero, and even won MVP of the match

                Bren Esports’ team captain made his presence felt in the early game after securing first blood just two minutes in

            <p>
                The Deadly Catch-Fatal Links wombo combo was very effective, as Pheww secured kills left and right from the early to mid-game

            <p>
                Bren Esports eventually took the insurmountable lead at the 16-minute mark after they secured the Enhanced Lord, which pushed the midlane

            <p>
                When the Lord was at RSG’s base, Bren ignored everything and went straight for the crystal for the 2-1 victory

            <p>
                In the post-game press conference, Pheww explained why out of all the midlane heroes that were available in that match, he went for a fighter hero who has fallen off the meta for the longest time

                Although the new CR-V was unveiled way back in July 2023, production of the sixth generation of Honda’s popular family SUV only started this month, with Honda of Canada Manufacturing kicking off the first production line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Next, production will start at Honda’s two US plants in Indiana and Ohio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It might take some time for it to be launched in Malaysia because Honda Malaysia will have to prepare CKD assembly for it in order to be cost competitive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new sixth gen Honda CR-V measures 4,694 mm long (+69 mm) and 1,864 mm wide (+10 mm), while the height is reduced to 1,681 mm (-8 mm)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on North American market specs, it can be had with either a 1.5 litre turbo engine or a 2.0 litre hybrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At least there is temperature gauge Now that Malaysian ringgit is stronger than the Yen, will Honda Malaysia will make the decision to lower their car prices? Honda also trade in USD and Thai Baht like Nissan, do you think honda cars are cheaper, Whenever the exchange rates are not favorable, you will hear rumblings from the automaker here in Malaysia about impending price increase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a consumer, we need to start questioning why the price will no go down if the exchange rates are the other way round
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nonsensical as it is
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ugly finally! blind spot monitoring system! i guess its a first for Honda! love this Follow current price OK acceptable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If price increase then may not worth it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But still Toyota no answer to this CRV price and space

                Although the new CR-V was unveiled way back in July 2023, production of the sixth generation of Honda’s popular family SUV only started this month, with Honda of Canada Manufacturing kicking off the first production line
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Next, production will start at Honda’s two US plants in Indiana and Ohio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It might take some time for it to be launched in Malaysia because Honda Malaysia will have to prepare CKD assembly for it in order to be cost competitive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The new sixth gen Honda CR-V measures 4,694 mm long (+69 mm) and 1,864 mm wide (+10 mm), while the height is reduced to 1,681 mm (-8 mm)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Based on North American market specs, it can be had with either a 1.5 litre turbo engine or a 2.0 litre hybrid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At least there is temperature gauge Now that Malaysian ringgit is stronger than the Yen, will Honda Malaysia will make the decision to lower their car prices? Honda also trade in USD and Thai Baht like Nissan, do you think honda cars are cheaper, Whenever the exchange rates are not favorable, you will hear rumblings from the automaker here in Malaysia about impending price increase
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a consumer, we need to start questioning why the price will no go down if the exchange rates are the other way round
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nonsensical as it is
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ugly finally! blind spot monitoring system! i guess its a first for Honda! love this Follow current price OK acceptable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If price increase then may not worth it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But still Toyota no answer to this CRV price and space

                This March 14, 2013 letter of support — which was signed by Najib as the finance minister then — effectively acted as a government guarantee for the US$3 billion debt, and which would mean the Malaysian government had to bear the debt if the 1MDB subsidiary was unable to make repayments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Finance Ministry’s former deputy secretary-general (policy) Datuk Siti Zauyah Mohd Desa said this while testifying as the 26th prosecution witness in Najib’s trial over the misappropriation of RM2.28 billion of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today, Siti Zauyah — who had worked for 25 years at the Finance Ministry — said this was not a normal transaction

            <p>
                Because in the first place, we had to do the paper and table it to the Cabinet on the same day

                After getting Najib’s approval, Finance Ministry officials had on March 11, 2013 then prepared a memorandum to the Cabinet on behalf of the finance minister Najib to seek the Cabinet’s approval

            <p>
                The Cabinet on March 13, 2013 made the decision to agree to the government’s issuance of the letter of support via the Finance Ministry for the 1MDB subsidiary’s US$3 billion debt, with Najib as the finance minister then signing off on the letter of support dated March 14, 2013
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This letter of support was crucial for the 1MDB subsidiary 1MDB Global Investment Limited (1MDB GIL) to be able to issue the US$3 billion bond
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 10-year US$3 billion bond was issued by 1MDB GIL on March 19, 2013, with a 4.4 per cent interest on the US$3 billion sum to be paid until 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution had on the first day of Najib’s trial said it would show that 1MDB GIL had on March 19, 2013 only received US$2.721 billion of the US$3 billion funds it raised with the balance paid to arranger Goldman Sachs as fees, and that over US$1 billion of the US$2.721 billion was paid to the two funds Devonshire Funds Limited and Enterprise Emerging Markets Fund (EEMF) — now known to be linked to Low Taek Jho — on March 20 and March 21, 2013

            <p>
                When you put 20% down on the purchase of a home, you don’t have to borrow as much money as someone whose down payment is only 5% or 10%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And as a result, your monthly mortgage payment may be considerably lower. But 20% down payments, while common, are by no means mandatory or the norm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So if you are hoping to save for retirement in addition to buying a home, you could opt for a 10% down payment and invest the remaining cash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This surcharge, known as PMI, will apply to the mortgage that uses a 10% down payment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We’ll also assume monthly compounding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yes, the smaller down payment of 10% means the mortgage ultimately costs you more over the life of the loan – about $30,000 more, between PMI and higher mortgage payments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the 20% down payment will result in less interest paid over the life of the mortgage, it also will also mean lower monthly payments ($333 less per month)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While putting less than 10% down would leave you paying PMI each month, that surcharge would presumably disappear once you’ve paid the equivalent of your 20% down payment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In our example, your monthly PMI would be $175
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether you choose to make a 20% down payment or put 10% down, there are ways to invest extra cash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The best option we found is to put 10% down, invest the remaining cash and then contribute $175 to your brokerage account each month once PMI is paid off

                Last Friday, Shah Alam High Court judge Datuk Mohd Yazid Mustafa acquitted and discharged Zahid of all 33 charges under Section 16 (A)(B) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act (MACC Act) and seven charges under Section 165 of the Penal Code

                Meanwhile, a senior lawyer who requested anonymity told theedgemarkets.com that there are many things wrong with Yazid's judgement and supports the prosecution's attempt to appeal

                Deputy public prosecutor, Harris Ong Mohd Jeffry Ong said this was reinforced by the fact of the established direct dealings between Datuk Seri Najib Razak, businessman Low Taek Jo or Jho Low and his close associate Eric Tan Kim Loong, through Good Star and Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The principal source of the monies in Datuk Seri Najib’s AmBank account ending with 694 was derived from monies transferred from Good Star and Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners which are companies controlled by Jho Low and Eric Tan,” he said in his written submission in the government’s bid to forfeit the seized items on Monday (Sept 26)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Good Star, Jho Low, Saudi’s Prince Faisal and Prince Saud, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners and Najib did not have any connection or business dealings with 1MDB to justify their receipt of such amounts of monies from 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The subsequent movement of monies from Good Star into Prince Faisal and Prince Saud’s Riyad Bank account and ultimately into Datuk Seri Najib’s AmBank account ending with 694 satisfies the elements of money laundering, which is an offence under Section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA) and the offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property under Section 411 of the Penal Code” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DPP Harris Ong further said that the opening of Najib’s AmBank account (9694) solely to receive 1MDB monies from Good Star and Aabar and followed by Tanore, and the subsequent layering by the opening of Najib AmBank account (1880), AmIslamic (1906) and (1898)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the absence of any justification afforded by Najib, satisfied the element of money laundering under Section 4(1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib and his wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor are the third parties wanting to claim the jewellery and wrist watches in a forfeiture application filed by the prosecution against Obyu Holdings, owned by businessman Tan Sri Bustari Yusof
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, lawyer Tania Scivetti representing Najib, argued that seven pieces of Richard Mille brand wrist watches were gifts to Najib and there was no nexus between the seized wrist watches and 1MDB funds
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Deputy public prosecutor, Harris Ong Mohd Jeffry Ong said this was reinforced by the fact of the established direct dealings between Datuk Seri Najib Razak, businessman Low Taek Jo or Jho Low and his close associate Eric Tan Kim Loong, through Good Star and Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The principal source of the monies in Datuk Seri Najib’s AmBank account ending with 694 was derived from monies transferred from Good Star and Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners which are companies controlled by Jho Low and Eric Tan,” he said in his written submission in the government’s bid to forfeit the seized items on Monday (Sept 26)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Good Star, Jho Low, Saudi’s Prince Faisal and Prince Saud, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners and Najib did not have any connection or business dealings with 1MDB to justify their receipt of such amounts of monies from 1MDB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The subsequent movement of monies from Good Star into Prince Faisal and Prince Saud’s Riyad Bank account and ultimately into Datuk Seri Najib’s AmBank account ending with 694 satisfies the elements of money laundering, which is an offence under Section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA) and the offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property under Section 411 of the Penal Code” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DPP Harris Ong further said that the opening of Najib’s AmBank account (9694) solely to receive 1MDB monies from Good Star and Aabar and followed by Tanore, and the subsequent layering by the opening of Najib AmBank account (1880), AmIslamic (1906) and (1898)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said the absence of any justification afforded by Najib, satisfied the element of money laundering under Section 4(1)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib and his wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor are the third parties wanting to claim the jewellery and wrist watches in a forfeiture application filed by the prosecution against Obyu Holdings, owned by businessman Tan Sri Bustari Yusof
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, lawyer Tania Scivetti representing Najib, argued that seven pieces of Richard Mille brand wrist watches were gifts to Najib and there was no nexus between the seized wrist watches and 1MDB funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "In the circumstances, we pray that the application be dismissed and the seized watches be immediately returned to Datuk Seri Najib,” she said

                If you filed your 2019 or 2020 taxes late, then you’re likely eligible for a rebate on those late fees
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The relief applies to the failure to file penalty, which can be hefty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if you’re one of the 1.6 million, you’ll have to file your overdue taxes by the end of the month or you could miss out

                And Sherr says the move on the IRS's part was necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Sometimes it was just like a day or two late, a week or two late, but there were penalties that were assessed,” Sherr says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                30 to the end of the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                30 to be eligible for relief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the forgiveness only applies if you filed late, not if you paid late
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “[The] IRS said they were going to try to get the adjustment by the end of October … It could take a month or two
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But I would say by the end of October, that account should be adjusted.” If you don’t see something by then, Sherr suggests contacting the IRS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And if you get a notice warning that you filed late and will need to pay a late penalty but believe you’re eligible for this exemption, then you should contact the IRS, says Sherr

            <p>
                The relief applies to the failure to file penalty, which can be hefty
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But if you’re one of the 1.6 million, you’ll have to file your overdue taxes by the end of the month or you could miss out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Sherr says the move on the IRS's part was necessary
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Sometimes it was just like a day or two late, a week or two late, but there were penalties that were assessed,” Sherr says
            </p>
            
            <p>
                30 to the end of the year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                30 to be eligible for relief
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the forgiveness only applies if you filed late, not if you paid late
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “[The] IRS said they were going to try to get the adjustment by the end of October … It could take a month or two
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But I would say by the end of October, that account should be adjusted.” If you don’t see something by then, Sherr suggests contacting the IRS
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And if you get a notice warning that you filed late and will need to pay a late penalty but believe you’re eligible for this exemption, then you should contact the IRS, says Sherr

                Uma Devi testified that the monies that went into Najib's AmIslamic bank account ending 694 were through transactions that took place in March and April 2013

            <p>

            <p>
                In its opening statement, lead prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram had told the court that nine money laundering charges faced by Najib in the case involved a sum of RM2,081,476,926

                Latest filings revealed that in addition to over S$530 million that Alibaba topped Lazada up with in May, the Chinese giant added another S$1.28 billion, bringing the total to just over S$1.8 billion for 2022

                Its Chinese parent has thus far pumped, on average, close to S$2 billion into the company each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By the time Shopee debuted, Lazada was already an established billion-dollar venture present in several countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And then, the new platform showed Lazada its place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shopee is simply slightly better at everything
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And while rudderless Lazada kept appointing a new CEO each year on average, Shopee successfully exported its methodology further abroad, starting with Latin America
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, Lazada announced that it wants to push US$100 billion in GMV per year by 2030, while Shopee is already hitting US$80 billion across all of its markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Being a manager — even a CEO — is always just a job (even if you’re bestowed with some stock options as part of your package)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is why I don’t think Lazada can compete with Shopee as long as Forrest Li is closely in charge of the business

                The other study is to understand consumer acceptance of a five-year subscription service, which Perodua is already offering to corporate clients under its EZ MOBi fleet arm, launched in January 2021

                “The Perodua Ativa Hybrid would be the best vehicle for us to gain unique insights on Malaysian behaviour as a controlled group, as this data will be used to anticipate our customers’ needs when using an electric vehicle,” said Perodua president and CEO Datuk Seri Zainal Abidin Ahmad

            <p>
                Maintenance (including wear and tear items), insurance and road tax will be covered by Perodua, as the Ativa Hybrids are registered under the company, not in the name of the customers

                As for the car itself, it’s straightforward

            <p>
                This is a CBU Daihatsu Rocky Hybrid, just with Perodua badging on the front, rear (P2 and Ativa) and steering wheel

            <p>
                The Perodua emblems and the Ativa wordmark are fitted on Malaysia-bound cars in Japan

            <p>
                So, what do you think of the Ativa Hybrid and this subscription deal? Good deal or you’re better off just buying the turbo-powered regular Ativa? In any case, P2 received 600 applications for the plan and all 300 cars are already spoken for

                Asked about allegations that Najib was given the codename “Merpati” or pigeon as a prisoner and that he is getting preferential treatment as a prisoner, Shafee rubbished this idea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “What is Merpati? They keeping pigeon in the hospital? Merpati is normally for pondan

                How can you say a man is a bird? I mean, describe she’s a nice bird, I won’t say he’s a nice bird, can you? He will run away,” he said in reply to reporters when met at the court complex here
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As for claims that Najib receives special treatment as a prisoner, Shafee pointed out that his client allegedly is not given a specific room for his meals during breaks in court proceedings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No, you will be surprised, if he’s special, they don’t even give him a room here for him to sit down and eat,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib is believed to have been placed in a holding room attached to the courtroom during breaks in the court proceeding

                Asked about allegations that Najib was given the codename “Merpati” or pigeon as a prisoner and that he is getting preferential treatment as a prisoner, Shafee rubbished this idea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “What is Merpati? They keeping pigeon in the hospital? Merpati is normally for pondan

                As for claims that Najib receives special treatment as a prisoner, Shafee pointed out that his client allegedly is not given a specific room for his meals during breaks in court proceedings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No, you will be surprised, if he’s special, they don’t even give him a room here for him to sit down and eat,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib is believed to have been placed in a holding room attached to the courtroom during breaks in the court proceeding

                Trent Alexander-Arnold has been left out of the England matchday squad for their dead-rubber against Germany, but Gareth Southgate might have just done Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp a massive favour Follow the latest transfer news and more with our LFC newsletter We have more newsletters Jurgen Klopp might admittedly not be the biggest fan of international football, but he is the staunchest defender of his own squad when they report for their respective nations
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet his treatment pales in comparison to that of Trent Alexander-Arnold after the right-back was left out of the matchday squad to face Germany
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will always be scrutiny regarding Alexander-Arnold’s limited involvement for England, seeing as he is English football’s most creative player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ironically though, Southgate has perhaps never been more justified to overlook Alexander-Arnold considering the right-back is in the worst form of his Liverpool career
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Injuries have ultimately not helped Klopp’s squad but the likes of Alexander-Arnold could be accused of suffering a hangover of their own after missing out on the Premier League and Champions League at the final last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yet rather than call him up and not use him, should Southgate have not just left an out-of-form Alexander-Arnold out of his latest camp entirely? Either way, perhaps his treatment of the defender could be a blessing in disguise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With his World Cup place under increasing threat, Alexander-Arnold has something else to play for when he returns to the AXA Training Centre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His main concern will always be getting the defender firing for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ultimately it’s win-win for Liverpool and the German now as they look to get the best back out of their overlooked defender
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If not, he’s given a winter off to work with Klopp in their mid-season training camp, giving the Reds a prolonged period to build Alexander-Arnold back up before unleashing him back on Premier League defences in 2023 after yet another snub, regardless of its justification

                WhatsApp 0-Day BugsCVE-2022-36934 – An integer overflow in WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.22.16.12, Business for Android prior to v2.22.16.12, iOS prior to v2.22.16.12, Business for iOS prior to v2.22.16.12 could result in remote code execution in an established video call
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Simplifying these following vulnerabilities, Whatsapp could cause your device to be hacked by receiving a Video File or When on a Video call
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An Integer overflow bug that affects WhatsApp allows attackers to execute the specially crafted arbitrary code during an established Video call without any sort of user interaction
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An integer overflow also know as “wraparound” occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation.  This RCE bug affects an unknown code of the WhatsApp component Video Call Handler, which allows an attacker to manipulate the bug to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and take complete control of WhatsApp Messenger
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to WhatsApp Advisory “An integer overflow in WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.22.16.12, Business for Android prior to v2.22.16.12, iOS prior to v2.22.16.12, Business for iOS prior to v2.22.16.12 could result in remote code execution in an established video call.” An Integer Underflow vulnerability (CVE-2022-27492) allows attackers to execute the arbitrary code remotely, and user interaction is required to exploit this bug successfully
            </p>

                This issue affects an unknown code block of the component Video File Handler
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a memory corruption vulnerability.  According to the WhatsApp advisory “An integer underflow in WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.22.16.2, WhatsApp for iOS v2.22.15.9 could have caused remote code execution when receiving a crafted video file.” To exploit this vulnerability, attackers drop a crafted video file on the user’s WhatsApp messenger

            <p>
                A spokesperson from WhatsApp told GBHackers that there is no evidence found for these vulnerabilities that have been exploited

                Two of the watches, one costing RM1.58 million and the other RM500,400, were bought by Datuk (now Tan Sri) Yeoh Seok Ping of YTL fame, Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah and Tania Scivetti submitted during hearing of a forfeiture application in the High Court on Monday (Sept 26)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Scivetti said the RM500,400 watch was paid for by Yeoh via Taman Equine (M) Sdn Bhd, while the RM1.58 million watch was paid via Sykt Pembenaan Yeoh Tiong Lay Sdn Bhd
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The third watch, costing RM419,300, was paid for by Datuk (now Tan Sri) Desmond Lim, the lawyer said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee, meanwhile, submitted that judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin should make a similar ruling as he did when dismissing the prosecution’s forfeiture case with regards to RM114 million worth of local and foreign currency
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shafee said when the prosecution had failed to prove the predicate offence, then the third-party claim filed by Najib should be allowed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Najib’s lawyers want Jamil to allow their third-party claim for the return of the seven watches to Najib, and dismiss the prosecution’s attempt to forfeit the watches under the Anti Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds from Unlawful Activity Act 2001 (AMLATFPUA)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prosecution had claimed that Alsen Chance Holding Ltd had also paid US$1.580 million to a Richard Mille outlet through two payments in August 2012 for the purchase of the branded watches and it further claimed that the rest of the watches were from these proceeds of Alsen Chance
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Scivetti and Shafee argued that the evidence on the purchase by the two businessman for Najib showed that there is a serious gap to the prosecution’s case or claims that the purchase of the watches came from 1MDB as alleged

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The remaining 9,000 pieces of jewellery that had been seized in the raid could not be proven to be from 1MDB proceeds, resulting in the prosecution amending its notice of forfeiture to only 2,345 pieces of jewellery, seven watches and 29 handbags
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Judge Jamil has fixed Nov 14 for decision on the forfeiture application

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 26 — Malaysian taxpayers could have to pay up to an additional RM1 billion for the country’s 15th general election if the ruling coalition forces one in November or the heart of the yearly monsoonal floods, a former Election Commission (EC) chairman predicted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When it comes to determining the date of an election, EC can only act as an advisory entity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This would mean that the additional expenditure alone for the poll would be around double what it cost to conduct the 2018 general election in its entirety
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abdul Aziz said that most of this extra RM1 billion would be spent on logistics, particularly on transporting voters to their respective polling stations in constituencies that were flooded
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The prediction would put the cost of holding GE15 above what it would have cost the country to hold a general election at the end of 2020 or during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Datuk Takiyuddin Hassan told Parliament that the additional measures and precautions of the movement control order (MCO) meant it would have cost RM1.2 billion for Malaysia to go to the polls then
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both were already significantly more than the RM171 million that was allocated for the 2008 general election
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yesterday, the EC was quoted saying the 15th general election could cost taxpayers up to RM1.1 billion in what could be the most expensive national polls to date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Abdul Aziz explained that a hypothetical GE15 during flood season would be more complex as the commission would also have to coordinate and liaise with additional entities such as the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma) for remedies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “So, if the general election is going to be in November, people are going to blame EC for that decision,” he added
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Malaysia nationalist party Umno has been agitating for an early general election within the year, with speculation that this could be in November as the 2023 Budget has yet to be tabled

            <p>
                Due to its low elevation – about two thirds of its area is vulnerable to flooding – thus flood control is crucial in the Netherlands

            <p>
                On the issue of MH17, the Prime Minister had informed Rutte that Malaysia’s next move would be made known after the trial in a Dutch court reached its verdict in November

                Premier League • England Trent Alexander-Arnold is at “Championship level” with one aspect of his game, according to a pundit who thinks he might struggle in a system other than Jurgen Klopp’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alexander-Arnold now has more than more than 200 appearances to his name for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, there are still areas that Alexander-Arnold has to develop
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the main criticisms of Alexander-Arnold is his lack of defensive awareness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It has prompted fresh examination of Alexander-Arnold’s skillset and deficiencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Look at Trent Alexander-Arnold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When it doesn’t work as well as it has this season, all you see is his defensive shortcomings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Roberto Carlos who deformed generations of defenders.” It is up to Alexander-Arnold and his coaches to work on this particular aspect of his game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But as long as the defensive questions linger over him, Alexander-Arnold might even struggle to retain a role of prominence with his country

                Premier League • England Trent Alexander-Arnold is at “Championship level” with one aspect of his game, according to a pundit who thinks he might struggle in a system other than Jurgen Klopp’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alexander-Arnold now has more than more than 200 appearances to his name for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, there are still areas that Alexander-Arnold has to develop
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the main criticisms of Alexander-Arnold is his lack of defensive awareness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It has prompted fresh examination of Alexander-Arnold’s skillset and deficiencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Look at Trent Alexander-Arnold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When it doesn’t work as well as it has this season, all you see is his defensive shortcomings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Roberto Carlos who deformed generations of defenders.” It is up to Alexander-Arnold and his coaches to work on this particular aspect of his game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But as long as the defensive questions linger over him, Alexander-Arnold might even struggle to retain a role of prominence with his country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, Alexander-Arnold still has Klopp’s faith – and rightly so

                "Why would I be any different? I am not arrogant enough to think that my contract is going to protect me in any way." Time and perspective will ultimately serve Southgate well when it comes to assessing his time as England manager
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no Southgate within the FA system now and with Graham Potter leaving Brighton for Chelsea earlier this month, the outstanding English candidate no longer seems to be available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So if that remains the case, whenever Southgate's time comes to an end, the list of candidates becomes extremely short very quickly
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Potter remains the bookmakers' favourite to become the next England manager, despite being less than a month into his new job at Stamford Bridge
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the Champions League is now the real pinnacle of the game, so it is difficult to imagine Potter giving that up to manage England just yet
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Newcastle's Eddie Howe is second favourite, but like Potter, is in the early stages of a club job that could take him into the Champions League
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Neither Gerrard or Lampard are perfect candidates, but the same can be said for Potter, Howe and the other names being mentioned
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is perhaps why the FA will be so keen for Southgate to ride out the storm that engulfs him right now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unless they are prepared to start with a clean slate and open the job up to the best coach available, rather than the top homegrown one, Southgate might still be the best option for England.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unless they are prepared to start with a clean slate and open the job up to the best coach available, rather than the top homegrown one, Southgate might still be the best option for England.

                Latest filings revealed that in addition to over S$530 million that Alibaba topped Lazada up with in May, the Chinese giant added another S$1.28 billion, bringing the total to just over S$1.8 billion for 2022

                Its Chinese parent has thus far pumped, on average, close to S$2 billion into the company each year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By the time Shopee debuted, Lazada was already an established billion-dollar venture present in several countries
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shopee is simply slightly better at everything
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And while rudderless Lazada kept appointing a new CEO each year on average, Shopee successfully exported its methodology further abroad, starting with Latin America
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last year, Lazada announced that it wants to push US$100 billion in GMV per year by 2030, while Shopee is already hitting US$80 billion across all of its markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is why I don’t think Lazada can compete with Shopee as long as Forrest Li is closely in charge of the business

                Now in its third generation, the X1 is the entry model in the German carmaker’s X line-up and will be offered with internal combustion engines (petrol and diesel), plug-in hybrid and fully electric powertrains – all roll off a single assembly line for the first time at BMW Group Plant Regensburg

                The mill is augmented by a 48-volt mild hybrid system that includes an electric motor rated at 19 PS (19 hp or 14 kW) and 55 Nm, resulting in a total system output of 218 PS (215 hp) and 360 Nm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The mild hybrid system also features a 20 Ah battery in the luggage compartment and serves to boost both efficiency and power delivery

            <p>
                One small point to note is this xDrive30 is without the blue accents like we saw during the global debut, but you can identify an iX1 by its “i” badge on the grille and blue ring on the BMW roundel

            <p>
                A year on from the launch of the Ativa, Perodua has introduced a hybrid version of its smallest SUV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We say this because the Ativa Hybrid isn’t officially available for sale
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Perodua is instead offering the car on a subscription basis, both to suss out consumers’ readiness for an “electric vehicle” (even though there’s definitely a petrol engine in there) and demand of a five-year subscription service
            </p>
            
            <p>
                All units of the Ativa Hybrid are painted pearl white with no black roof option, unlike the regular Ativa
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At this juncture you might have noticed that the car looks a little different from the regular Ativa
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s already well-known that the latter is based on the Daihatsu Rocky, but the Hybrid model is literally a Rocky Hybrid with Perodua and Ativa badges
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also has a completely different engine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The big benefit is fuel consumption – the Hybrid achieves a claimed 28km per litre combined on the WLTP cycle, compared to 20.7km per litre for the standard Rocky, which shares the Ativa’s 1.0-litre mill
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Perodua’s (very optimistic) Malaysian Driving Cycle, the car can go up to 31.3 km per litre
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the outside, the Ativa Hybrid retains the Rocky’s angular front and rear bumpers, replete with the Hybrid-specific honeycomb grille
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Daihatsu’s interior has also been carried over, ditching the Ativa’s black-and-red leather seats in favour of all-black leather and fabric

                China’s FAST telescope has deepened the mystery surrounding the origin and nature of cosmic explosions known as fast radio bursts after detecting features that cannot be explained by existing physical models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are powerful flashes of radio waves from deep space that only last for milliseconds, but they generate as much energy as the Sun does in a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first fast radio burst was discovered in 2007, and since then, hundreds of these cosmic flashes have been detected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, their origin and physical nature remain unclear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previous studies have suggested that the first fast radio burst detected from the Milky Way had originated from a magnetar, which is a highly magnetic neutron star
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team was led by scientists from Peking University and the National Astronomical Observatories of China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They detected 1,863 bursts in 82 hours over 54 days from an active fast radio burst source called FRB 20201124A in a galaxy outside our own
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zhang said it had been thought that young magnetars would only be found in active star-forming regions of a galaxy, but the FRB is in a region where no such activity takes place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It had also been assumed that FRBs exist in regions of galaxies with a high stellar density, but the research team found the FRB source did not reside there, providing new clues to their origin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a separate study published in Nature Communications, Nanjing University’s Wang proposed that the fast radio burst source might originate from a binary system containing a magnetar and a high-mass Be star, which is a heterogeneous set of stars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this new model provides important clues to explain the origin of fast radio bursts, and it could also explain three other recently discovered FRBs

                Zhang said it had been thought that young magnetars would only be found in active star-forming regions of a galaxy, but the FRB is in a region where no such activity takes place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It had also been assumed that FRBs exist in regions of galaxies with a high stellar density, but the research team found the FRB source did not reside there, providing new clues to their origin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a separate study published in Nature Communications, Nanjing University’s Wang proposed that the fast radio burst source might originate from a binary system containing a magnetar and a high-mass Be star, which is a heterogeneous set of stars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this new model provides important clues to explain the origin of fast radio bursts, and it could also explain three other recently discovered FRBs

                Loke urged Ismail Sabri to act like the nation’s prime minister and not be pressured by Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and his followers who are persistently calling for an early 15th general election (GE15)

                Loke said DAP are not challenging Ismail Sabri nor Umno to dissolve Parliament but rather have been telling Ismail Sabri in a nice way in Parliament and in Dewan Rakyat that he need not be concerned with pressure from Zahid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said Ismail Sabri has the memorandum of understanding (MoU) to back him up and does not need to feel threatened by Zahid as the president of Umno
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Loke urged Ismail Sabri to act like the nation’s prime minister and not be pressured by Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and his followers who are persistently calling for an early 15th general election (GE15)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I want to tell Ismail Sabri and Umno that if they call for an election during the heavy rain and flood season the public will punish them in ways they have never seen before
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said DAP are not challenging Ismail Sabri nor Umno to dissolve Parliament but rather have been telling Ismail Sabri in a nice way in Parliament and in Dewan Rakyat that he need not be concerned with pressure from Zahid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Loke said Ismail Sabri has the memorandum of understanding (MoU) to back him up and does not need to feel threatened by Zahid as the president of Umno
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I want to remind Ismail Sabri that you are the country’s prime minister so act like a prime minister and not some party follower,” he added

                He said under Article 48(1)(e) of the Federal Constitution, an individual is disqualified as a member of either House of Parliament if they have been convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year or a fine of not less than RM2,000, and have not received a pardon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the Constitution also stipulates that if an application for a pardon was filed within 14 days of the date of conviction, then the disqualification will only come into effect as soon as the petition is disposed of

            <p>
                Azhar, however, said Najib had filed for a review of the Federal Court decision under Rule 137 of the Federal Court Rules, adding that his MP status remains until the royal pardon and review are disposed of

                The Federal Court on Aug 23 upheld Najib’s 12-year prison sentence and RM210mil fine for the misappropriation of RM42mil in SRC International funds

                Sinama-Pongolle 82′ After a rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone, sung by many attending Anfield for the first time, Man United started quickly and opened the scoring thanks to a fantastic volley by Dimitar Berbatov

            <p>
                Roy Keane wasn’t even on the pitch yet! Liverpool continued to attack and Aurelio was the next to shoot from distance

                He sliced his effort well wide, though, and was swiftly sent back to the halfway line by his captain, Alonso

            <p>
                England have gone from being one of the most prolific teams in Europe to failing to score from open play in five consecutive games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One goal always looked likely to be enough to beat an England team short on ideas and intensity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why does Raheem Sterling, to take the most high-profile example, look like a pale imitation of the player he is at club level and has long been for England? Captain Harry Kane seemed set to beat Wayne Rooney’s 53-goal all-time scoring record in time for the World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I know the strikers and attacking players here are confident players.” The problem is, England don’t look confident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It feels like a lot of the intensity and belief has gone out of Southgate’s England, particularly up front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bukayo Saka found himself playing left wing-back in Milan on Friday night, but Southgate doesn’t seem to have many other solutions beyond the trusty back-three comes good again, rather than finding a way to make a back four work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Relying on a teenager with limited big tournament experience is a risk, but Southgate has little choice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even England’s set-pieces, such a potent weapon at the 2018 World Cup, aren’t working anymore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So it feels a lot like Southgate’s side have become the football version of the nation’s cricket team in 1986
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So maybe, just maybe, it will be alright on the night in Qatar

            </p>
            
            <p>
                One goal always looked likely to be enough to beat an England team short on ideas and intensity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why does Raheem Sterling, to take the most high-profile example, look like a pale imitation of the player he is at club level and has long been for England? Captain Harry Kane seemed set to beat Wayne Rooney’s 53-goal all-time scoring record in time for the World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I know the strikers and attacking players here are confident players.” The problem is, England don’t look confident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It feels like a lot of the intensity and belief has gone out of Southgate’s England, particularly up front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bukayo Saka found himself playing left wing-back in Milan on Friday night, but Southgate doesn’t seem to have many other solutions beyond the trusty back-three comes good again, rather than finding a way to make a back four work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Relying on a teenager with limited big tournament experience is a risk, but Southgate has little choice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even England’s set-pieces, such a potent weapon at the 2018 World Cup, aren’t working anymore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So it feels a lot like Southgate’s side have become the football version of the nation’s cricket team in 1986
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So maybe, just maybe, it will be alright on the night in Qatar

                4 is finalising plans for a one-week training stint with reigning world champion Viktor Axelsen and his compatriot Anders Antonsen before the Denmark Open from Oct 13-18

                Thaw Nandar Aung, a model from Myanmar speaks to a reporter in Bangkok, Thailand on March 31, 2021

                Thaw Nandar Aung, also known as Han Lay, told The Associated Press by phone that she has been stuck at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport since being denied reentry to Thailand when she arrived Wednesday night from a short trip to Vietnam

                On Thursday night, Thai police told her that Myanmar police had come to see her, but she declined to meet them, Thaw Nandar Aung said

                Thaw Nandar Aung used her platform as the Myanmar contestant at last year's Miss Grand International beauty pageant in the Thai capital, Bangkok, to speak about the killings of pro-democracy protesters in her homeland

                MANCHESTER UNITED should swoop for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, reckons former Red Devil Antonio Valencia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Ecuador midfielder, 20, has shone since breaking into the Seagulls side last season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And fellow Ecuadorian Valencia has urged his former club to sign Caicedo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United could also move back in for Youri Tielemans in January after missing out on the Leicester midfielder in the summer

                Barcelona have confirmed Ronald Araujo suffered a thigh injury while on international duty with Uruguay, adding to the Blaugrana's defensive problems after Jules Kounde sustained a hamstring injury
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Araujo was substituted just five minutes into Uruguay's 1-0 friendly loss to Iran in Austria on Friday, having pulled up less than a minute into the match.  Earlier on Friday, the French Football Federation announced Jules Kounde was to leave Didier Deschamps' squad after being replaced during their Nations League win over Austria on Thursday

            <p>
                Barcelona have now revealed the nature of the duo's injuries, with Araujo suffering an avulsion fracture in his right thigh and Kounde having a biceps femoris injury in his left hamstring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Losing both Araujo and Kounde for any significant period of time would be a major blow for Xavi, who has made the pair defensive mainstays in his new-look team

                The Umno president who was just acquitted of all 40 graft charges in the Foreign Visa System (VLN) case said for those who tried to belittle Umno and their leadership under Barisan Nasional, the coming general elections would prove the unity and mechanism that Umno has at the grassroots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid then claimed that he was subjected to ridicule and negative labels, including attempts to topple him from the Umno presidency, when he was undergoing the trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I am not afraid to defend the Umno despite various political threats," he said Ahmad Zahid then reiterated claims that his court case was politically motivated after he refused to heed calls by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to dissolve Umno when the latter was prime minister under Pakatan Harapan rule
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I did not waver and the fact is, I still fight to defend Umno after being trusted by our grassroots all over the country to carry out my duties as president," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Friday (Sept 23), Ahmad Zahid was freed of all 40 graft charges in the VLN case after the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case

                About Us Advertise   KOTA KINABALU, Sept 24 — Authorities yesterday had to remove a 900-metre fishing net that was found near a famous diving spot in Sipadan island, damaging some of its coral reefs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The net, which had drifted away from a fishing boat, was caught on the famed Barracuda Point dive site and extended toward Hanging Gardens, with some 18 fishes caught in it, including two sharks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Jafry Arifin said that the net was sighted at about 6am yesterday by a Sabah Parks ranger and the dive marshal on duty when they saw the floating buoys of the net which had drifted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “After calling in and reporting the matter, work began to remove the net with the help of several dive operators — Seahorse Scuba, Borneo Jungle and Dive Semporna

            </p>
            
            <p>
                A wooden fishing boat had also approached the marine park yesterday morning around 9.40am, without a permit to enter, and claimed responsibility for the net which had drifted with the currents into the park

                China claims to have developed the world’s most advanced system for evaluating an aircraft’s ability to deliver a weapon at hypersonic speed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chinese media reported that this technology apparently uses robotic arms to test an aircraft’s capacity to discharge payload in a strong wind tunnel, making it perfect for testing a prototype hypersonic bomber
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Researchers at the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Center in Sichuan province are said to have developed a new hypersonic captive trajectory system (CTS) that employs two robotic arms to hold and tilt a prototype aircraft and its cargo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also enables them to analyze how the aircraft and its delivered item perform at high speeds.  However, Lin cautions that separating the aircraft from its payload at such high speeds could be risky
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shock waves, vortexes, and other airflow patterns may form when a hypersonic aircraft separates from another object, thereby increasing the chance of a collision involving the aircraft and its payload.  “Whether the storage can be safely separated from the aircraft becomes a big problem,” she said.  The team observed shock waves between the hypersonic aircraft and separating cargo during the Mach 6 experiment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The construction of hypersonic aircraft needs extensive wind tunnel tests since test flights are expensive

                Given the effect of La Nina, climatologist Prof Dr Fredolin Tangang said the risk of widespread flooding, especially on the east coast of peninsula Malaysia, was very high
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No doubt the weather and climate, especially the extremes, have become more variable in the last couple of decades.“Consistent with the global mean temperature, the temperature in Malaysia has also been rising steadily,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Climate expert Prof Datuk Dr Azizan Abu Samah from Universiti Malaya agreed, saying that La Nina, coupled with the Indian Ocean Dipole event that caused the weather to be ripe for rain, could bring higher than average rainfall to Malaysia during the north-east monsoon season, expected to begin in November and strengthen in December.“Certainly in November, especially in the east coast states of Kelantan and Terengganu, there will be more rain than usual, depending on how bad the weather is,” he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fire and Rescue Services Department director-general Datuk Seri Mohammad Hamdan Wahid said some 14,800 personnel had been directed to be on high alert amid La Nina and the impending north-east monsoon season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 12, Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob instructed the disaster management committees at the district level to be immediately activated to face the north-east monsoon and floods
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a statement, the Prime Minister said this was following MetMalaysia’s forecast that the north-east monsoon would be from November to March 2023.

                Judge Azura Alwi made the ruling after deputy public prosecutor Aslinda Ahad requested the court to discharge without acquitting the Baling MP under Section 254 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code following a representation submitted by Abdul Azeez
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lawyer Amer Hamzah Arshad, representing Abdul Azeez, confirmed the matter
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The money laundering charges were framed under Section 4 (1) (b) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorist Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 which is punishable under Section 4(1) of the same Act
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 5 this year, Abdul Azeez failed in his appeal at the Court of Appeal to quash the three charges of corruption and six charges of money laundering made against him
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, the panel allowed Abdul Azeez’s appeal to strike out four money laundering charges

                Justice Mohd Yazid also said he doubted the credibility of a ledger – which was tendered as evidence – as there was some missing data regarding the inflow and outflow of funds allegedly delivered to Ahmad Zahid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The judge also said he found that the code names "Z" and "ZH", said to denote Ahmad Zahid in the ledger, were insufficient to prove that the accused had received the money
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The judge said Tan did not explain why the code names were given to Ahmad Zahid
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that another UKSB director, Datuk Fadzil Ahmad, who had a key role in securing the contract for the company had also testified that he was unaware of the funds being delivered to Ahmad Zahid
            </p>
            
            <p>

                Powell indicated the Fed will likely raise the fund rate by another 75 bps in November and 50 bps in December while undertaking quantitative tightening at the same time to drain liquidity from the economy and markets

                Leonard Glenn Francis (pic) had cut off his GPS ankle bracelet before fleeing from house arrest in San Diego, while waiting for sentencing over a bribery scheme that lasted more than a decade and involved dozens of US Navy officers

                Interpol Venezuela director-general Carlos Garate Rondon said Francis had come to Venezuela via Mexico and was headed to Russia

            <p>
                Francis was under house arrest in San Diego when he removed his monitoring anklet and escaped on Sept 4
            </p>

                Francis had been allowed to remain under house arrest to receive medical care while he cooperated with the prosecution

                Leonard Glenn Francis (pic) had cut off his GPS ankle bracelet before fleeing from house arrest in San Diego, while waiting for sentencing over a bribery scheme that lasted more than a decade and involved dozens of US Navy officers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                His re-arrest came on the eve of the date of scheduled sentencing in California yesterday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The international manhunt for Francis ended with his arrest by Venezuelan authorities on Tuesday morning at the Caracas airport, as he was about to board an airplane for another country, the US Marshals Service said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Interpol Venezuela director-general Carlos Garate Rondon said Francis had come to Venezuela via Mexico and was headed to Russia
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Francis was under house arrest in San Diego when he removed his monitoring anklet and escaped on Sept 4
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Francis had been allowed to remain under house arrest to receive medical care while he cooperated with the prosecution

                Liverpool will need to find an heir for Virgil van Dijk in the future and Jürgen Klopp may have already caught a glimpse of an ideal target this season
            </p>

            <p>
                At the heart of that defensive performance was Min-Jae Kim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defender has won an impressive 68.97 per cent of his 4.42 defensive duels per 90 (Wyscout), and 67.5 per cent of his whopping total of 6.09 aerial duels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Min-Jae Kim has all the tools to be a solid option for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And if Liverpool are on the hunt for a centre-back in the near future, Julian Ward should undoubtedly make Min-Jae Kim one of the main transfer targets.

                Liverpool will need to find an heir for Virgil van Dijk in the future and Jürgen Klopp may have already caught a glimpse of an ideal target this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But while the task of replacing Van Dijk may seem like a gargantuan one, it might not be so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the heart of that defensive performance was Min-Jae Kim
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The defender has won an impressive 68.97 per cent of his 4.42 defensive duels per 90 (Wyscout), and 67.5 per cent of his whopping total of 6.09 aerial duels
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Min-Jae Kim has all the tools to be a solid option for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And if Liverpool are on the hunt for a centre-back in the near future, Julian Ward should undoubtedly make Min-Jae Kim one of the main transfer targets.

                HLA also subscribed to another 680,500 units in AME REIT on Sept 20

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                HLA also subscribed to another 680,500 units in AME REIT on Sept 20
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Subsequently, Quek on Sept 21 acquired another 1.83 million units in AME REIT through HLA
            </p>
            
            <p>

                After hearing arguments from both the prosecution and Zahid’s lawyer, High Court judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah decided that the prosecution could start impeachment proceedings against Zahid’s third defence witness Jefri Jamil

                Manchester United are "ahead of schedule" with their recruitment plans under manager Erik ten Hag, club football director John Murtough said on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United spent more than £225 million on six new players during Ten Hag's first summer in charge, including Lisandro Martinez and Antony from former club Ajax
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Overall, we are ahead of schedule in our recruitment plans as envisaged at the start of the summer, and we do not anticipate the same level of activity in future windows
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As always, our planning focuses on the summer window." United signed Martinez, Anthony, Casemiro, Christian Eriksen, Tyrell Malacia and Martin Dubravka over the summer, but Murtough said the most significant arrival was Ten Hag himself
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "The most important development during the 2021-22 season was the appointment of Erik ten Hag as manager," Murtough added

            <p>
                The fourth quarter financial results also revealed the club's wage bill has increased by £61m to £384m after investment in the squad in both 2021 and 2022 while the cost of terminating contracts with former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and former interim manager Ralf Rangnick, plus associated staff, was £24.7m.

                MANCHESTER UNITED boss Erik ten Hag told new boys Tyrell Malacia and Antony to "take it easy" on each other after their previous battles in Holland

                Malacia joined United from Feyenoord early in the summer window - before Ten Hag reunited with Antony on deadline day

                The Spanish newspaper reports Pique caused "very serious damage" to the club owing to his own private interests and those of the club conflicting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pique demanded £124million gross across his five-year contract from 2017 which followed on from him telling the club he wanted to be paid more than compatriot Ramos
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ramos is said to have earned just under £11m net per year at Real Madrid, a figure which Barcelona topped for Pique's deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu awarded the Spaniard with a contract valuing just over £13m net a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, Pique's shareholder status in production company Kosmos Studios also caused some major issues for the club

                The Spanish newspaper reports Pique caused "very serious damage" to the club owing to his own private interests and those of the club conflicting
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pique demanded £124million gross across his five-year contract from 2017 which followed on from him telling the club he wanted to be paid more than compatriot Ramos
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ramos is said to have earned just under £11m net per year at Real Madrid, a figure which Barcelona topped for Pique's deal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu awarded the Spaniard with a contract valuing just over £13m net a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, Pique's shareholder status in production company Kosmos Studios also caused some major issues for the club

                Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Noraini Ahmad said currently the number of women enrolled in local public higher education institutions is more than 350,000 which constitutes 61 per cent of the overall student enrolment, while more than 530,000, which is 53 per cent of female students, are enrolled in local private higher education institutions

                In this case, its Renault twin is the Captur, which shares its underpinnings with the just-revealed ASX; indeed, much of the ASX front end appears similar to that of the Captur

                Just one image of the 2023 ASX interior has been supplied for now, and here the B-segment Mitsubishi twin to the Captur shares the French car’s dashboard architecture

            <p>

                In addition, given that Malaysia has very high food imports, the food costs for many in Malaysia are expected to soar.   Malaysia’s unbridled politicking is not helping the ringgit situation either
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Research in economics and finance over the decades established that the strongest predictors of an imminent speculative attack on a currency are the behaviour of the home country’s international reserves, the real exchange rate, domestic credit, credit of the public sector, and domestic inflation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This strategy of currency defeat is also not an option in case of rising domestic inflation, as it will undoubtedly send domestic inflation to new highs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low foreign reserves (that are potentially sliding lower) is critical for a country that highly depends on food imports (RM63.3 billion in 2021)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, the interest rate hike is also believed to ward off currency depreciation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time, the depreciating ringgit makes it unattractive for foreign investors to invest in local production as they take their profits in foreign currencies unless it is a foreign-denominated debt which exposes Malaysia to other risks of depreciating ringgit

            </p>
            
            <p>
                This strategy of currency defeat is also not an option in case of rising domestic inflation, as it will undoubtedly send domestic inflation to new highs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Low foreign reserves (that are potentially sliding lower) is critical for a country that highly depends on food imports (RM63.3 billion in 2021)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, the interest rate hike is also believed to ward off currency depreciation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same time, the depreciating ringgit makes it unattractive for foreign investors to invest in local production as they take their profits in foreign currencies unless it is a foreign-denominated debt which exposes Malaysia to other risks of depreciating ringgit
            </p>
