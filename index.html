                Every year the Social Security Board of Trustees releases an update on the financial status of the Social Security trust funds
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “It is important to strengthen Social Security for future generations,” Kilolo Kijakazi, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a statement when the report was released

                “Millennials already have low expectations for the role Social Security will play in their retirement plans," CEO Ron Mastrogiovanni said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If policymakers take no action, Social Security could still pay 80% of benefits using its tax income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Increasing Social Security’s tax revenues, she says, should address the shortfall and restore solvency as the population ages

            <p>
                Social Security helps replace earnings during retirement, but it’s not meant to cover all your expenses
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the average worker, Social Security replaces about 40% of annual savings before retirement, according to the SSA — though that figure varies depending on income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The average Social Security retirement benefit in August 2022 was $1,627 per month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That’s less than $20,000 per year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you start collecting your Social Security benefits early, you’ll have less to work with
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, the loss of future Social Security benefits can be offset with a “consistent and modest annual increase” in savings, according to the HealthView Services report

                Making the most of dividend income means knowing how to generate it and how to use it to your advantage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dividend aristocrats and dividend kings, for example, represent the companies that have the longest track records for increasing dividend payouts year over year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Again, some dividend stocks can produce higher returns than others
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s also important to consider how and where taxes fit in when planning for dividend income
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Owning individual dividend stocks has both pros and cons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When selecting dividend stocks, it’s important to not be sidetracked by a high dividend yield only, as this may not paint a true picture of the company’s financial health
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This can be a simpler way to diversify with dividend stocks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Growth dividend ETFs, on the other hand, may focus on stocks that are poised to grow their dividend payouts over time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, high yield dividend ETFs may concentrate holdings on the stocks paying the highest dividend yields
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With dividend stocks and dividend ETFs, it’s important to look for an online brokerage that charges zero commission fees to trade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line Dividend stocks and dividend ETFs can provide diversification in a portfolio and they can also generate income for retirement

            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s also important to consider how and where taxes fit in when planning for dividend income

                Owning individual dividend stocks has both pros and cons
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When selecting dividend stocks, it’s important to not be sidetracked by a high dividend yield only, as this may not paint a true picture of the company’s financial health
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This can be a simpler way to diversify with dividend stocks
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Growth dividend ETFs, on the other hand, may focus on stocks that are poised to grow their dividend payouts over time
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, high yield dividend ETFs may concentrate holdings on the stocks paying the highest dividend yields
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With dividend stocks and dividend ETFs, it’s important to look for an online brokerage that charges zero commission fees to trade
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bottom Line Dividend stocks and dividend ETFs can provide diversification in a portfolio and they can also generate income for retirement

            <p>
                When you put 20% down on the purchase of a home, you don’t have to borrow as much money as someone whose down payment is only 5% or 10%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And as a result, your monthly mortgage payment may be considerably lower. But 20% down payments, while common, are by no means mandatory or the norm
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So if you are hoping to save for retirement in addition to buying a home, you could opt for a 10% down payment and invest the remaining cash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This surcharge, known as PMI, will apply to the mortgage that uses a 10% down payment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We’ll also assume monthly compounding
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yes, the smaller down payment of 10% means the mortgage ultimately costs you more over the life of the loan – about $30,000 more, between PMI and higher mortgage payments
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the 20% down payment will result in less interest paid over the life of the mortgage, it also will also mean lower monthly payments ($333 less per month)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While putting less than 10% down would leave you paying PMI each month, that surcharge would presumably disappear once you’ve paid the equivalent of your 20% down payment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In our example, your monthly PMI would be $175
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether you choose to make a 20% down payment or put 10% down, there are ways to invest extra cash
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The best option we found is to put 10% down, invest the remaining cash and then contribute $175 to your brokerage account each month once PMI is paid off

            <p>
                Premier League • England Trent Alexander-Arnold is at “Championship level” with one aspect of his game, according to a pundit who thinks he might struggle in a system other than Jurgen Klopp’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alexander-Arnold now has more than more than 200 appearances to his name for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, there are still areas that Alexander-Arnold has to develop
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the main criticisms of Alexander-Arnold is his lack of defensive awareness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It has prompted fresh examination of Alexander-Arnold’s skillset and deficiencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Look at Trent Alexander-Arnold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When it doesn’t work as well as it has this season, all you see is his defensive shortcomings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Roberto Carlos who deformed generations of defenders.” It is up to Alexander-Arnold and his coaches to work on this particular aspect of his game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But as long as the defensive questions linger over him, Alexander-Arnold might even struggle to retain a role of prominence with his country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, Alexander-Arnold still has Klopp’s faith – and rightly so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, to reach his full potential, there are adaptations that Alexander-Arnold may have to make

                Premier League • England Trent Alexander-Arnold is at “Championship level” with one aspect of his game, according to a pundit who thinks he might struggle in a system other than Jurgen Klopp’s
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alexander-Arnold now has more than more than 200 appearances to his name for Liverpool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, there are still areas that Alexander-Arnold has to develop
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the main criticisms of Alexander-Arnold is his lack of defensive awareness
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It has prompted fresh examination of Alexander-Arnold’s skillset and deficiencies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Look at Trent Alexander-Arnold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When it doesn’t work as well as it has this season, all you see is his defensive shortcomings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was Roberto Carlos who deformed generations of defenders.” It is up to Alexander-Arnold and his coaches to work on this particular aspect of his game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But as long as the defensive questions linger over him, Alexander-Arnold might even struggle to retain a role of prominence with his country
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hence, Alexander-Arnold still has Klopp’s faith – and rightly so
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, to reach his full potential, there are adaptations that Alexander-Arnold may have to make
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                “The Perodua Ativa Hybrid would be the best vehicle for us to gain unique insights on Malaysian behaviour as a controlled group, as this data will be used to anticipate our customers’ needs when using an electric vehicle,” said Perodua president and CEO Datuk Seri Zainal Abidin Ahmad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maintenance (including wear and tear items), insurance and road tax will be covered by Perodua, as the Ativa Hybrids are registered under the company, not in the name of the customers
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Participants will have to return the car to Perodua after five years

                Good or bad depends on how you view cars and car ownership
            </p>

                As for the car itself, it’s straightforward

            <p>
                This is a CBU Daihatsu Rocky Hybrid, just with Perodua badging on the front, rear (P2 and Ativa) and steering wheel

            <p>
                The Perodua emblems and the Ativa wordmark are fitted on Malaysia-bound cars in Japan

            <p>
                So, what do you think of the Ativa Hybrid and this subscription deal? Good deal or you’re better off just buying the turbo-powered regular Ativa? In any case, P2 received 600 applications for the plan and all 300 cars are already spoken for

                Asked about allegations that Najib was given the codename “Merpati” or pigeon as a prisoner and that he is getting preferential treatment as a prisoner, Shafee rubbished this idea

                How can you say a man is a bird? I mean, describe she’s a nice bird, I won’t say he’s a nice bird, can you? He will run away,” he said in reply to reporters when met at the court complex here

            <p>
                As for claims that Najib receives special treatment as a prisoner, Shafee pointed out that his client allegedly is not given a specific room for his meals during breaks in court proceedings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “No, you will be surprised, if he’s special, they don’t even give him a room here for him to sit down and eat,” he said

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maybe his food, because of the ulcer, yes, they cannot give him spicy food, they cannot give him oily food.” Asked if Najib is getting outside food, Shafee denied this by saying, “Cannot what (sic)”, before adding that even the family today were not allowed to provide food to Najib due to the need to monitor his diet in relation to his health condition

            <p>
                Asked why Najib had to be transferred from Hospital Kuala Lumpur to the Cheras Rehabilitation Hospital previously, Shafee said Najib was already receiving physiotherapy at Hospital Kuala Lumpur but that it was not adequate

                On September 23, the Cheras Rehabilitation Hospital announced that Najib was in good health and sent back to Kajang prison

                Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Datuk Takiyuddin Hassan told Parliament that the additional measures and precautions of the movement control order (MCO) meant it would have cost RM1.2 billion for Malaysia to go to the polls then

                Yesterday, the EC was quoted saying the 15th general election could cost taxpayers up to RM1.1 billion in what could be the most expensive national polls to date

            <p>
                Abdul Aziz explained that a hypothetical GE15 during flood season would be more complex as the commission would also have to coordinate and liaise with additional entities such as the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma) for remedies

            <p>

            <p>
                Malaysia nationalist party Umno has been agitating for an early general election within the year, with speculation that this could be in November as the 2023 Budget has yet to be tabled

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 26 — Malaysian taxpayers could have to pay up to an additional RM1 billion for the country’s 15th general election if the ruling coalition forces one in November or the heart of the yearly monsoonal floods, a former Election Commission (EC) chairman predicted

            <p>
                Due to its low elevation – about two thirds of its area is vulnerable to flooding – thus flood control is crucial in the Netherlands

            <p>
                On the issue of MH17, the Prime Minister had informed Rutte that Malaysia’s next move would be made known after the trial in a Dutch court reached its verdict in November

                He said Malaysia did not want to “jump the gun” and make known its next course before the verdict

                All 298 people on board were killed in the July 17, 2014 incident, two-thirds of them Dutch nationals.

                With Erik ten Hag at the helm, it was clear United needed wholesale changes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thankfully for Ten Hag, the club has since recovered well with a 2-1 home win over Liverpool proving a turning point
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ultimately, that may also see United missing out on the top four once again, showing them up for spending so heavily
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I don’t think they’ll get into the top four
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But I think United could be the ones to miss out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Spending big money on individuals isn’t the answer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I’d be surprised if United get a result because City have been fantastic, they look great
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Johnson is right and they do lose to City, United will still be expected to make the top four
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That will be the minimum requirement Ten Hag will demand of his players too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the United manager, despite Johnson’s warning, is seemingly pushing for more new arrivals too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even so, Ten Hag is still settling in at Old Trafford and still trying to fathom his best side

                Thankfully for Ten Hag, the club has since recovered well with a 2-1 home win over Liverpool proving a turning point
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ultimately, that may also see United missing out on the top four once again, showing them up for spending so heavily
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I don’t think they’ll get into the top four
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But I think United could be the ones to miss out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Spending big money on individuals isn’t the answer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I’d be surprised if United get a result because City have been fantastic, they look great
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If Johnson is right and they do lose to City, United will still be expected to make the top four
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That will be the minimum requirement Ten Hag will demand of his players too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And the United manager, despite Johnson’s warning, is seemingly pushing for more new arrivals too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even so, Ten Hag is still settling in at Old Trafford and still trying to fathom his best side

            <p>
                Sin met the condiment-sprinkling chef at his restaurant Nusr-Et in swanky Knightsbridge, London
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sin, who accompanied shoe designer Datuk Jimmy Choo to the London fashion week, said her designs received much media attention
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Welsh designer Julien Macdonald also wore her songket-designed jacket for the show
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2001, MacDonald was named British Designer of The Year
            </p>
            
            <p>

                England have gone from being one of the most prolific teams in Europe to failing to score from open play in five consecutive games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One goal always looked likely to be enough to beat an England team short on ideas and intensity
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Why does Raheem Sterling, to take the most high-profile example, look like a pale imitation of the player he is at club level and has long been for England? Captain Harry Kane seemed set to beat Wayne Rooney’s 53-goal all-time scoring record in time for the World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I know the strikers and attacking players here are confident players.” The problem is, England don’t look confident
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It feels like a lot of the intensity and belief has gone out of Southgate’s England, particularly up front
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bukayo Saka found himself playing left wing-back in Milan on Friday night, but Southgate doesn’t seem to have many other solutions beyond the trusty back-three comes good again, rather than finding a way to make a back four work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Relying on a teenager with limited big tournament experience is a risk, but Southgate has little choice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even England’s set-pieces, such a potent weapon at the 2018 World Cup, aren’t working anymore
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So it feels a lot like Southgate’s side have become the football version of the nation’s cricket team in 1986
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So maybe, just maybe, it will be alright on the night in Qatar

                Sinama-Pongolle 82′ After a rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone, sung by many attending Anfield for the first time, Man United started quickly and opened the scoring thanks to a fantastic volley by Dimitar Berbatov

                Cristiano Ronaldo has ‘surprised’ Man Utd team-mate Marcus Rashford by giving him ‘constructive criticism’ over his performances, according to reports
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, a lack of concrete interest from clubs in Europe meant that Ronaldo ended up staying at Man Utd and made his first appearance in the Europa League earlier this month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As the gap between Manchester’s men increases, United are closing in on City’s women The 37-year-old has made just one Premier League start this campaign and five substitute appearances with Ronaldo not used to being among the substitutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rashford is leading the line while Ronaldo is on the bench and The Sun claim the pair have decided to ‘bury the hatchet for the good of Manchester United’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The newspaper insist the pair have had a ‘difficult relationship’ since Ronaldo returned to the club from Juventus but the Portugal superstar has now ‘become one of Rashford’s biggest cheerleaders’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “But since the transfer window closed, his attitude has improved and he has been very helpful with Marcus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Marcus has been a bit surprised by it because it’s always difficult when you’re playing and a team-mate isn’t and you’re both fighting for the same position
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “He’s grateful for the advice and for the fact that Ronaldo seems genuine in that he wants Marcus to improve and succeed.” Rashford has contributed three goals and two assists in six Premier League matches so far this season and former Liverpool and Chelsea defender Glen Johnson thinks the England international can be “unstoppable” ahead of the World Cup
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Rashford, Sterling and Kane would be my starting three at the World Cup, but you have incredible strength in depth
            </p>

                “After Denmark, I will take part in the French Open (Oct 25-30) and most probably the Hylo Open (Germany, Nov 1-6) and the Australian Open (Nov 15-20),” said Zii Jia, whose ultimate goal is to do well at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

                Ng Tze Yong also reached the singles final.” Looking forward, Zii Jia is eyeing more ranking points as he chases a spot in the season-ending World Tour Finals in Guangzhou from Dec 14-18

            <p>
                “After Denmark, I will take part in the French Open (Oct 25-30) and most probably the Hylo Open (Germany, Nov 1-6) and the Australian Open (Nov 15-20),” said Zii Jia, whose ultimate goal is to do well at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

                China’s FAST telescope has deepened the mystery surrounding the origin and nature of cosmic explosions known as fast radio bursts after detecting features that cannot be explained by existing physical models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are powerful flashes of radio waves from deep space that only last for milliseconds, but they generate as much energy as the Sun does in a year
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first fast radio burst was discovered in 2007, and since then, hundreds of these cosmic flashes have been detected
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, their origin and physical nature remain unclear
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Previous studies have suggested that the first fast radio burst detected from the Milky Way had originated from a magnetar, which is a highly magnetic neutron star
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team was led by scientists from Peking University and the National Astronomical Observatories of China
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They detected 1,863 bursts in 82 hours over 54 days from an active fast radio burst source called FRB 20201124A in a galaxy outside our own
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Zhang said it had been thought that young magnetars would only be found in active star-forming regions of a galaxy, but the FRB is in a region where no such activity takes place
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It had also been assumed that FRBs exist in regions of galaxies with a high stellar density, but the research team found the FRB source did not reside there, providing new clues to their origin
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a separate study published in Nature Communications, Nanjing University’s Wang proposed that the fast radio burst source might originate from a binary system containing a magnetar and a high-mass Be star, which is a heterogeneous set of stars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said this new model provides important clues to explain the origin of fast radio bursts, and it could also explain three other recently discovered FRBs

            <p>
                The model, also known as Han Lay,  from Myanmar who denounced her country’s military rulers last year from the stage of a beauty pageant in Thailand said Friday, Sept

            <p>
                Thaw Nandar Aung, also known as Han Lay, told The Associated Press by phone that she has been stuck at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport since being denied reentry to Thailand when she arrived Wednesday night from a short trip to Vietnam

                Myanmar’s military seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and has cracked down heavily on widespread opposition to its rule
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - AFP Thaw Nandar Aung said she was charged in absentia in September last year under a section of Myanmar's Penal Code covering sedition for speaking out against the military takeover at the pageant and online

            <p>
                On Thursday night, Thai police told her that Myanmar police had come to see her, but she declined to meet them, Thaw Nandar Aung said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Thaw Nandar Aung used her platform as the Myanmar contestant at last year's Miss Grand International beauty pageant in the Thai capital, Bangkok, to speak about the killings of pro-democracy protesters in her homeland

                "In doing so, the leaders involved should not use their power and selfishness.” "Today in my country, Myanmar, while I am going to be on this stage, there are so many people dying, more than 100 people died today

                President Vladimir Putin's move to order Russia's first military mobilisation since World War Two triggered protests across the country and seen flocks of military-age men flee, causing tailbacks at borders and flights to sell out

                Multiple reports have also documented how people with no military service have been issued draft papers - contrary to Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu's guarantee that only those with special military skills or combat experience would be called up - prompting even ultra-loyal pro-Kremlin figures to publicly express concern

            <p>
                The matter was raised during his meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on the sidelines of the 77th United Nations General Assembly in New York recently

                Loke urged Ismail Sabri to act like the nation’s prime minister and not be pressured by Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and his followers who are persistently calling for an early 15th general election (GE15)

Baena, who has the credentials to play across the front line, hasn’t actually started a La Liga game for Unai Emery’s side so far this season, but he’s still made a big impression as a substitute, scoring three goals in six appearances off the bench

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Yellow Submarine, beaten by Liverpool in last season’s Champions League semi-finals, would like to keep him for ‘at least two or three more seasons’, but the situation is out of their hands
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool used the same trick to land Ibrahima Konaté from RB Leipzig last summer

            <p>
                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Baena, who has the credentials to play across the front line, hasn’t actually started a La Liga game for Unai Emery’s side so far this season, but he’s still made a big impression as a substitute, scoring three goals in six appearances off the bench
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If, or more accurately when, he forces himself into the starting side, it will be exciting to watch his development this season

                Barcelona have confirmed Ronald Araujo suffered a thigh injury while on international duty with Uruguay, adding to the Blaugrana's defensive problems after Jules Kounde sustained a hamstring injury
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Araujo was substituted just five minutes into Uruguay's 1-0 friendly loss to Iran in Austria on Friday, having pulled up less than a minute into the match.  Earlier on Friday, the French Football Federation announced Jules Kounde was to leave Didier Deschamps' squad after being replaced during their Nations League win over Austria on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barcelona have now revealed the nature of the duo's injuries, with Araujo suffering an avulsion fracture in his right thigh and Kounde having a biceps femoris injury in his left hamstring
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Losing both Araujo and Kounde for any significant period of time would be a major blow for Xavi, who has made the pair defensive mainstays in his new-look team

                The Umno president who was just acquitted of all 40 graft charges in the Foreign Visa System (VLN) case said for those who tried to belittle Umno and their leadership under Barisan Nasional, the coming general elections would prove the unity and mechanism that Umno has at the grassroots
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ahmad Zahid then claimed that he was subjected to ridicule and negative labels, including attempts to topple him from the Umno presidency, when he was undergoing the trial
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I am not afraid to defend the Umno despite various political threats," he said Ahmad Zahid then reiterated claims that his court case was politically motivated after he refused to heed calls by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to dissolve Umno when the latter was prime minister under Pakatan Harapan rule
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I did not waver and the fact is, I still fight to defend Umno after being trusted by our grassroots all over the country to carry out my duties as president," he said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Friday (Sept 23), Ahmad Zahid was freed of all 40 graft charges in the VLN case after the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case

                About Us Advertise   KOTA KINABALU, Sept 24 — Authorities yesterday had to remove a 900-metre fishing net that was found near a famous diving spot in Sipadan island, damaging some of its coral reefs

                The net, which had drifted away from a fishing boat, was caught on the famed Barracuda Point dive site and extended toward Hanging Gardens, with some 18 fishes caught in it, including two sharks

            <p>
                Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Jafry Arifin said that the net was sighted at about 6am yesterday by a Sabah Parks ranger and the dive marshal on duty when they saw the floating buoys of the net which had drifted

                But it is unclear how hard the US government will fight for the return of Leonard, the Malaysian owner of a ship-servicing company in South-East Asia who is the central character in one of the largest bribery scandals in Pentagon history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leonard had his first court appearance Thursday (Sept 22), according to a law enforcement official in Venezuela who spoke Friday (Sept 23) to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to discuss judicial proceedings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leonard is the mastermind of a huge bribery scheme that ensnared dozens of Navy officials
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, Smilde said he wouldn't be surprised to see Leonard pop up in a Venezuelan-government produced confession video hinting that he has more salacious details
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Neither US nor Venezuelan officials have released details about how Leonard spent his time on the run or what he planned to do in Russia, but his travels to three countries in a period of two weeks indicate he had access to money and other help
            </p>

                Jason Forge, a former federal prosecutor in San Diego involved in high-profile extradition cases out of Mexico, said Leonard may try to convince Venezuela that he's got something to offer, but Forge doubts he truly does

                But it is unclear how hard the US government will fight for the return of Leonard, the Malaysian owner of a ship-servicing company in South-East Asia who is the central character in one of the largest bribery scandals in Pentagon history
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leonard had his first court appearance Thursday (Sept 22), according to a law enforcement official in Venezuela who spoke Friday (Sept 23) to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to discuss judicial proceedings
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leonard is the mastermind of a huge bribery scheme that ensnared dozens of Navy officials
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still, Smilde said he wouldn't be surprised to see Leonard pop up in a Venezuelan-government produced confession video hinting that he has more salacious details
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Neither US nor Venezuelan officials have released details about how Leonard spent his time on the run or what he planned to do in Russia, but his travels to three countries in a period of two weeks indicate he had access to money and other help

                China claims to have developed the world’s most advanced system for evaluating an aircraft’s ability to deliver a weapon at hypersonic speed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Chinese media reported that this technology apparently uses robotic arms to test an aircraft’s capacity to discharge payload in a strong wind tunnel, making it perfect for testing a prototype hypersonic bomber
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Researchers at the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Center in Sichuan province are said to have developed a new hypersonic captive trajectory system (CTS) that employs two robotic arms to hold and tilt a prototype aircraft and its cargo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It also enables them to analyze how the aircraft and its delivered item perform at high speeds.  However, Lin cautions that separating the aircraft from its payload at such high speeds could be risky
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Shock waves, vortexes, and other airflow patterns may form when a hypersonic aircraft separates from another object, thereby increasing the chance of a collision involving the aircraft and its payload.  “Whether the storage can be safely separated from the aircraft becomes a big problem,” she said.  The team observed shock waves between the hypersonic aircraft and separating cargo during the Mach 6 experiment
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The construction of hypersonic aircraft needs extensive wind tunnel tests since test flights are expensive

                Shock waves, vortexes, and other airflow patterns may form when a hypersonic aircraft separates from another object, thereby increasing the chance of a collision involving the aircraft and its payload.  “Whether the storage can be safely separated from the aircraft becomes a big problem,” she said.  The team observed shock waves between the hypersonic aircraft and separating cargo during the Mach 6 experiment

                Given the effect of La Nina, climatologist Prof Dr Fredolin Tangang said the risk of widespread flooding, especially on the east coast of peninsula Malaysia, was very high

                Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi speaks during the closing electoral campaign rally of the centre-right's coalition in Piazza del Popolo, ahead of the September 25 general election, in Rome, Italy, September 22, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia party belongs to a right-wing coalition expected to win the general election on Sunday, is not new to defending Putin's actions in Ukraine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Berlusconi, a personal friend of the Russian leader, downplayed Putin's warmongering instincts after he threatened to use nuclear weapons in the wake of suffering setbacks in Ukraine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Putin was pushed by the Russian people, by his party, by his ministers to invent this special operation," Berlusconi said, using the official Russian wording for the war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I haven't even understood why Russian troops spread around Ukraine while in my mind they should have only stuck around Kyiv", Berlusconi insisted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin's stated war aims have varied during the seven month war

                Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi speaks during the closing electoral campaign rally of the centre-right's coalition in Piazza del Popolo, ahead of the September 25 general election, in Rome, Italy, September 22, 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia party belongs to a right-wing coalition expected to win the general election on Sunday, is not new to defending Putin's actions in Ukraine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Berlusconi, a personal friend of the Russian leader, downplayed Putin's warmongering instincts after he threatened to use nuclear weapons in the wake of suffering setbacks in Ukraine
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Putin was pushed by the Russian people, by his party, by his ministers to invent this special operation," Berlusconi said, using the official Russian wording for the war
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I haven't even understood why Russian troops spread around Ukraine while in my mind they should have only stuck around Kyiv", Berlusconi insisted
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Putin's stated war aims have varied during the seven month war
            </p>

                Some analysts believe Bank Negara will opt to keep its benchmark overnight policy rate (OPR) unchanged at 2.5% in November as inflation remains manageable
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He added that another 25 bps rise in the OPR to 2.75% will bring the benchmark interest rate closer to the pre-pandemic level of 3.25%
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Powell indicated the Fed will likely raise the fund rate by another 75 bps in November and 50 bps in December while undertaking quantitative tightening at the same time to drain liquidity from the economy and markets
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some think Bank Negara could be prepared to live with a weaker local currency as economic health remains its key concern and the three OPR rate hikes this year did little to reverse the trajectory of the ringgit-US dollar rate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The risk free rate differential is at 75 bps now and could rise to 200 bps if the Fed raises its Fed fund rate to 4.25%-4.5% by the end of this year as anticipated
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Fed has overestimated its tightening cycle in the past and is now more hawkish than the market which is expecting the Fed fund rate to hit 4.4% in this tightening cycle while the Fed has signalled it could go to 4.6% by end 2023.

                Han Lay, who captured international attention last year with a moving beauty pageant speech calling for urgent help for Myanmar's people during a military crackdown, did not have a valid visa to enter Thailand, the immigration department said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Nawit Itsaragrisil, founder of Thailand's Miss Grand International pageant, who also represents Han Lay, said she had been in the transit area of a Bangkok airport since Wednesday afternoon
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said Han Lay was stopped on arrival because she was subject of an Interpol notice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She wants to live in Thailand," he told Reuters
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Interpol did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Han Lay was the subject of an Interpol notice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an interview with Reuters last year, she said her people "will never give up"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Han Lay's Instagram postings indicate she has spent most of the past year in Thailand

                After hearing arguments from both the prosecution and Zahid’s lawyer, High Court judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah decided that the prosecution could start impeachment proceedings against Zahid’s third defence witness Jefri Jamil
            </p>

            <p>
                After taking time to compare Jefri's statement to the MACC and his testimony in court today, the judge decided there was material differences between both

                Manchester United are "ahead of schedule" with their recruitment plans under manager Erik ten Hag, club football director John Murtough said on Thursday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                United spent more than £225 million on six new players during Ten Hag's first summer in charge, including Lisandro Martinez and Antony from former club Ajax

            <p>
                "Overall, we are ahead of schedule in our recruitment plans as envisaged at the start of the summer, and we do not anticipate the same level of activity in future windows

            <p>
                "The most important development during the 2021-22 season was the appointment of Erik ten Hag as manager," Murtough added

                The fourth quarter financial results also revealed the club's wage bill has increased by £61m to £384m after investment in the squad in both 2021 and 2022 while the cost of terminating contracts with former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and former interim manager Ralf Rangnick, plus associated staff, was £24.7m.

                The decision, which was unanimous, takes the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate to 3% to 3.25% -- the highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis, and up from near zero at the start of this year

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Sept 22 — The Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) plans to establish a university that specifically caters for women, which indirectly would increase Malaysia’s visibility in higher education and further strengthen its position as an international higher education hub
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Noraini Ahmad said currently the number of women enrolled in local public higher education institutions is more than 350,000 which constitutes 61 per cent of the overall student enrolment, while more than 530,000, which is 53 per cent of female students, are enrolled in local private higher education institutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noraini added that in the QS World University Rankings (WUR) 2023, there is only one local university listed in the top 100 and four out of five local research universities are listed in the top 200
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noraini said the MOHE are committed to enhancing cooperation and reducing barriers in education services with its international counterparts

                About Us Advertise PUTRAJAYA, Sept 22 — The Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) plans to establish a university that specifically caters for women, which indirectly would increase Malaysia’s visibility in higher education and further strengthen its position as an international higher education hub
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Noraini Ahmad said currently the number of women enrolled in local public higher education institutions is more than 350,000 which constitutes 61 per cent of the overall student enrolment, while more than 530,000, which is 53 per cent of female students, are enrolled in local private higher education institutions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noraini added that in the QS World University Rankings (WUR) 2023, there is only one local university listed in the top 100 and four out of five local research universities are listed in the top 200
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Noraini said the MOHE are committed to enhancing cooperation and reducing barriers in education services with its international counterparts

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Gakpo could initially struggle to play as a striker in the Premier League due to the increased competitiveness of the league compared to the Eredivisie
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It highlights that he would certainly adapt to the culture at Arsenal  If Arsenal want to sign their long-term target in Gakpo then Edu must be proactive in completing this deal

                In addition, given that Malaysia has very high food imports, the food costs for many in Malaysia are expected to soar.   Malaysia’s unbridled politicking is not helping the ringgit situation either

            <p>
                Research in economics and finance over the decades established that the strongest predictors of an imminent speculative attack on a currency are the behaviour of the home country’s international reserves, the real exchange rate, domestic credit, credit of the public sector, and domestic inflation

            <p>
                This strategy of currency defeat is also not an option in case of rising domestic inflation, as it will undoubtedly send domestic inflation to new highs

            <p>
                Low foreign reserves (that are potentially sliding lower) is critical for a country that highly depends on food imports (RM63.3 billion in 2021)

                At the same time, the depreciating ringgit makes it unattractive for foreign investors to invest in local production as they take their profits in foreign currencies unless it is a foreign-denominated debt which exposes Malaysia to other risks of depreciating ringgit

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 21 — Eight Kuala Lumpur residents, led by former Malaysian Bar chairman Datuk Ambiga Sreenevasan, have demanded the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) provide information on flood mitigation plans for the upcoming monsoon season or face a lawsuit

            <p>
                “Such transparency of information is crucial for public awareness and to enable public participation which, in turn, is a cornerstone of good public policy-making
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The residents pointed out that the A-G found that only eight out of 104 or 7.7 per cent of flood mitigation measures proposed in the 2017 master plan have been implemented or are in the process of implementation by DBKL
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
                They also said the AG had identified that five short-term mitigation measures proposed in the flood master plan had not been implemented in the highly flood-prone areas encompassing Jalan Tun Razak, Persiaran Ampang Hilir and Jalan U-Thant as of March this year
