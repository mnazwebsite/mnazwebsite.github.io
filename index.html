                It said it was wrong to compare the RM600 “presumed work value” of housewives under the Housewives’ Social Security Bill 2022 (SKSSR) with the RM1,500 minimum wage for workers
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If the ‘presumed work value’ is revised to match the RM1,500 minimum wage, then the contribution rate would increase to RM418.80 a year or RM34.90 per month,” said Socso’s chief communications and corporate affairs officer Izad Raya, in a statement issued today

                Perkeso was responding to an FMT report earlier in which several women’s rights groups criticised the government’s RM600 “presumed work value” of a housewife, saying it did not reflect the amount of work she does
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Monday, the bill came under fire while being debated in the Dewan Rakyat due to a clause that mentions RM600 as the “presumed work value” of a housewife
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yeoh, who is a former deputy women, family and community development minister, also said if RM600 was seen as the presumed monthly income rate, then a housewife would only be earning RM20 per day

                The bill, among others, proposes that the maximum amount paid out for permanent disability be RM30,000

                On Saturday (July 30), at the Road March 2022 programme, in conjunction with 215th Police Day celebrations at Dataran Merdeka, people started lining up as early as 7am, even though the counters only opened at 9am

                Abu Kassim Karim, in his 40s, said he chose to pay the summonses at Dataran Merdeka despite the long queue, as he could enjoy some savings by doing so

                Launching the celebrations at Dataran Putrajaya here today, Ismail said despite the independence, Keluarga Malaysia (Malaysian Family) was constantly faced with challenges from outside the country that could undermine the long-established harmony

                “Liven up the National Day celebrations this year by decorating your premises with the Jalur Gemilang to show your love for the country,” he said at the launch of the celebrations here

                Ismail said Covid-19 was the biggest challenge faced by the country and the whole world over the past two years, but Malaysia had managed the pandemic well because of the firm measures taken by the government

                “Now, we are in the transition to the endemic phase and signs of economic recovery are visible, with Keluarga Malaysia beginning to enjoy the goodness of life like before.” Ismail said the National Day and Malaysia Day celebrations this year, themed “Keluarga Malaysia Teguh Bersama”, were most relevant to the concept of harmony in a big family living together in unity with a sense of gratefulness

                In disputing the description, raised by Dewan Rakyat Speaker Azhar Harun today, they cited the “Sheraton Move” of 2020 which led to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan government and the formation of a new government led by Muhyiddin

                Santiago also said that Muhyiddin never brought any substantial changes to the law when he was the home minister during PH’s brief reign

                Santiago said that “there isn’t much that he (Muhyiddin) can speak of” during his tenure as home minister, or even as prime minister for that matter

            <p> </p>

                “I’m not clear what does Azhar mean? What is he smoking,” Santiago said, referring to the term “overlooked reformist” that Azhar was quoted as having used of Muhyiddin at a book launch today

                The Family Frontiers group said the ministry’s inefficiency and lack of responsibility demonstrated is incredibly unacceptable
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “With an approval rate of less than 0.6%, it can be deduced that it would take the home ministry around six centuries to process all applications,” the group said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The longer the home ministry delays the citizenship application process, the longer they deliberately place Malaysian women and their children in situations of harm and violence.” The lack of a long-term legal status in Malaysia creates heightened uncertainty and anxiety for Malaysian women and their non-citizen children, including the possibility of children being separated from their families at any point
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The group contrasted the ministry’s performance with its budget allocation of RM17 billion, one of the largest among all ministries
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Data by the national registration department showed that only 19 of the 3,407 citizenship applications had been approved from 2018 to June this year

                In slamming the ministry, Merbok MP Nor Azrina Surip, of PKR, said this meant the rate of approvals came up to 0.6% and it would take 681 years to approve all the child citizenship applications in Malaysia

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                ON Dec 1, 1948, police found the body of a well-dressed man on Somerton Park beach in Adelaide, Australia, who had all the tags on his clothes removed and a scrap of paper in his pocket with the Persian phrase tamám shud (meaning finished) printed on it
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                So, for over 70 years, the man's identity was a mystery which spawned wild theories internationally of who he really was, from murdered spy to alien abductee
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Prof Derek Abbot from the University of Adelaide announced on Monday (July 25) that the Somerton Man was Carl "Charles" Webb, a 43-year-old electrical engineer from Melbourne who went missing around the same time
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Prof Abbot worked together with American Genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick using the DNA gathered from the body, as well as from hair gathered from a plaster face cast made of the man's by investigators after his body was found a match in a DNA database and developed a family tree to eke out his identity
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As to why the Melbourne man was in Adelaide, a city some 727km away, Prof Abbot told the daily that they had evidence that Webb was looking for his wife
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Australian police have yet to release a statement on the identity of the man, so his identity is yet to be confirmed though signs seem to point to the fact that Webb is the most likely candidate for the identity of the mysterious Somerton Man

                Lawyer Yudistra Darma Dorai, representing Najib, when contacted Friday (July 29), said the application would be heard before Judge Datuk Ahmad Bache

                On Nov 18 last year, Thomas and the government submitted an application to quash the suit after claiming that the former prime minister's action in suing them was a collateral attack to prevent criminal proceedings against him
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib filed the suit on Oct 22 last year, naming Thomas and the government as the first and second defendants

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In the statement of claim, Najib claimed that he had been wrongly accused in court in the case of 1MDB, International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), abuse of power under the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009 and money laundering under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA 2001)

                Najib claimed that in 2015, Thomas had met Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to discuss wrongdoings and mismanagement allegedly over the 1MDB funds and also advised Dr Mahathir to take civil and criminal action against Najib over his involvement in 1MDB

                According to a Borneo Post report, Karim said the Elections Act was a federal law which meant that Sarawak only needed to wait for Parliament’s anti-hopping bill to be gazetted for it to be enforced

                Meanwhile, Melaka chief minister Sulaiman Md Ali said the Barisan Nasional state government was ready to amend its state enactments to implement a similar anti-hopping law

                Bangi MP Ong Kian Ming said the decision to ban chicken exports, which he said “may look like a workable short-term solution”, had ended up hurting chicken producers and chicken imports instead
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This impact was felt most strongly in Singapore, which imports one-third of its chicken supplies from Malaysia, including almost all of its live chickens.” The DAP MP pointed out that the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) announced a list of new farms and establishments which could export chicken products to Singapore, including from Australia, Brazil and Thailand, as well as the approval of three establishments in Indonesia to export chicken meat and related meat products to the country
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the agriculture and food industries ministry must understand that the path to food security was not through providing enough supply for the domestic market, but also by producing enough supply to export to foreign markets
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Instead of harming local chicken farmers by short-term policies such as the export ban and by putting in price controls that are not reflective of the underlying cost of production, Mafi (the ministry) should be putting in place plans to help our chicken farmers expand their domestic production and access to foreign markets.” Ong suggested that the ministry work together with the Federation of Livestock Farmers Association of Malaysia to provide soft loans through Agrobank for long-term investments and expansion in this sector
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said market access for chicken producers should be expanded to other countries, including the halal markets in the Middle East

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the ministry should assure export markets, especially Singapore, that such export bans would not be implemented again and that contractual sanctity would be respected

                The couple were among 18 cable car passengers who were left stranded in their cabins for more than 30 minutes after an operating system error on Wednesday (July 27) evening brought the Mount Faber cable car line to a halt

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Chan, 29, and Chan, 30, had gone for dinner at a restaurant on Mount Faber to celebrate her birthday and decided to ride the cable car from the mainland to Sentosa island and back as there was a discount on the tickets

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But as they were about to return to the Mount Faber station, their cable car stopped without warning
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Chan, a bank executive, said there were initially no announcements about what had happened, and he had to call cable car operator Mount Faber Leisure Group's emergency hotline for more information
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Responding to queries, a Mount Faber Leisure Group spokesman said the cable car line's operating system had to be rebooted due to the error

                The PH presidential council, which disclosed this today, said it “took note” of Ismail’s statement on Thursday that a new MoU would not be signed

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail had said on Wednesday that Umno had decided against extending the MoU and, as such, he would abide by his party’s decision

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This means the MoU sealed on 13 September 2021 remains in force as long as the 14th Parliament is not dissolved as stated in Item 2.1 of the MoU “Therefore, the presidential council orders Pakatan Harapan representatives in the MoU steering committee to carry out meetings immediately with government representatives to discuss several matters in the MoU that are still outstanding, besides studying matters stated by the prime minister including related to political funding,” they said in a joint statement today

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The MoU refers to an agreement signed between PH and Ismail Sabri last year to support government Bills geared towards key institutional reforms for the sake of Malaysia’s political stability and post-pandemic economic recovery
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                PH also referenced Ismail Sabri's remarks two days ago that there would not be a new MoU replacing the current deal between his government and the Opposition
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail Sabri was also reported saying on July 27 that he intended to table a political funding Bill, which was not part of the MoU with PH

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The MoU listed a series of transformations agreed on by both the opposition and government, namely strengthening the Covid-19 plan, transformation of the administration, parliamentary reform, the independence of the judiciary, the Malaysia Agreement 1963, and forming a bipartisan steering committee

                State deputy education minister Dr Annuar Rapaee said the Sarawak government had always been appreciative of talent

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Sarawak has recognised the UEC since 2014, allowing holders of the certificate to work in the state civil service and apply for scholarships from Yayasan Sarawak and for entry into the state-owned University of Technology Sarawak
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Federal education minister Radzi Jidin recently said his ministry had no plans to recognise the UEC as it went against the National Education Policy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Annuar said the world was now borderless and the government should not restrict anyone from acquiring the education of his or her choice
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Education should be progressive and allow for better and more diverse human capital,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The federal government’s role should be more towards financially supporting state governments in education matters.” Aside from its recognition of the UEC, the Sarawak government is aggressively pursuing mastery of English

                Ukraine's armed forces denied carrying out the strike, saying Russian artillery had targeted the prison to hide the mistreatment of those held there and lay the blame on Ukraine

                Indonesia, said Saravanan, had also agreed to integrate the existing system between Malaysia’s Immigration Department and its embassy in Kuala Lumpur for the recruitment of Indonesian domestic workers (PDI)

                He said the integration of this system would act as a single channel for the recruitment and entry of PDI into Malaysia as agreed in the previous Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

                “This system will be operational in three more weeks under the supervision of the Malaysia-Indonesia Joint Working Group,” he said in a statement with his Indonesian counterpart, Ida Fauziyah, as reported by Bernama
            </p>

                “Therefore, the Indonesian side has agreed to withdraw the restrictions on the entry of PDI and Indonesian labourers (TKI) into Malaysia starting Aug 1 (Monday),” said Saravanan

                Saravanan was in Jakarta in conjunction with the meeting of the Joint Working Group between Malaysia and Indonesia as outlined in the MOU regarding the PDI, which was completed on July 27

                Hayatul said the facts in the present suit were similar to those before another High Court judge, Firuz Jaffril

            <p> </p>

                She filed the suit last year, claiming that the grandchildren had control of the money deposited in Jamaluddin’s local and overseas accounts

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, the judge denied two other claims by Aminah involving shares worth RM313 million in Alpine Motion Sdn Bhd and Ivory Insights Sdn Bhd, which he held did not form part of Jamaluddin’s estate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                This is following a decision by the High Court that allowed the striking out application filed by Ikhwan Hafiz Jamaludin, 35, and Nur Anis Jamaludin, 37, on the grounds of res judicata

                In her brief judgment, High Court Justice Hayatul Akmal Abdul Aziz said Aminah, 88, had filed the suit based on substantially similar facts and issues on the administration of the estate of the deceased (Jamaludin) that she had already raised before a different court

                She said on June 23, 2017, Nur Anis and Ikhwan applied for letters of administration of their father's estate at the High Court and they were granted the letters of administration on July 6, 2017

                State labour department director Wan Zulkifli Wan Setapa said there was a worrying trend every year as 200,000 residents were recorded leaving Sabah in search of job opportunities

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Sabah also relied on foreign workers in the plantation, construction, restaurant and agricultural sectors, and according to immigration department data, there were more than 135,000 non-resident workers in the state, more than 50% of whom were Indonesians

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If the relocation of the Indonesian capital to Kalimantan in 2024 attracts Indonesians who are working in Sabah, (even) if 50% of these (Indonesian) workers leave, the state economy could collapse

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Related parties need to look at the matter in order to find an alternative or exit policy to overcome and resolve the (labour) issue,” he said when speaking at the 2022 Sabah Labour Convention here

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When met by reporters later, he said all parties needed to brace themselves for the eventuality because the two-year horizon was not that distant as Sabah was already facing a labour crisis

                However, the news was untrue and Khalid was still under treatment at a private hospital
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When contacted, Khalid's former political secretary Faekah Husin said it was a callous act to spread such a rumour
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The post by Khalid's team, on his official Facebook Timeline, also demanded that the rumour be immediately stopped out of respect for the former mentri besar's family as they were already facing a difficult time
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is understood that Khalid is suffering from kidney failure and undergoes dialysis
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khalid had also undergone an open-heart surgery sometime earlier this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khalid was a prolific mentri besar during his tenure from 2008 to 2014 and being a stickler for efficiency, ensured the smooth running of the state government machinery
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Being frugal, Khalid also held on very tightly to the state’s purse strings which saw Selangor’s coffers having a healthy balance
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was ousted by his party PKR in 2014 which saw Khalid vacating the mentri besar’s position and then assumed by former party deputy president Datuk Seri Azmin Ali.

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But what I find annoying about this new law is it creates unequal treatment under the law
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Are they treated equally in law? The answer has to be no
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Because it’s legal for one person but not for the other to smoke
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                But there is already a law in place
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It just grates when a law discriminates
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                So I expect this law will be passed in Parliament
