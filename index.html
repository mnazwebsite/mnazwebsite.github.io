                “After this, we will have at least 1,500 permanent positions every year to be offered to contract officers,” he said at a press conference after appearing as a panel member at a dialogue session on The Future of Our Healthcare held in conjunction with the 2022 Health Policy Summit here

                Khairy said the ministry would hold talks with the Public Services Commission (SPA) to determine whether those who were unsuccessful could re-apply for a permanent position

                This is to ensure that they are given good incentives and opportunities for specialised and sub-specialised training.” Meanwhile, Khairy said MoH would also look at a suitable model to determine whether a health service commission should be established by law or administratively

                PSB president Wong Soon Koh had said on Sunday the party would avail itself of all available remedies against See, whom he claimed had made an oral and written undertaking before being chosen as PSB’s candidate in the last state election

                See had said his decision to leave PSB was to free himself from party politics to spend more time on his work as an assemblyman and to work with others, including NGOs, who shared his mission for a better Sarawak

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Arul Kanda filed his application to strike out the suit last June and the application by Irwan was filed on Feb 18 this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his application, Irwan alleged, among others, that the suit against him was premature as the investment of Brazen Sky Ltd and the payment of Aabar Investments PJS Ltd were not clearly unsustainable because the court had yet to determine 1MDB suffered losses of US$1.83 billion (RM8.17 billion) and US$3.5 billion (RM15.6 billion)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                1MDB filed the suit against Arul Kanda and Irwan in May last year, alleging that they had committed breach of trust and conspiracy causing 1MDB to suffer losses amounting to US$1.83 billion in relation to its investment in 1MDB-Petrosaudi Ltd, which was converted into the alleged Brazen Sky investment said to be found in the Bridge Global Fund
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                1MDB also alleged that the two defendants committed breach of trust and conspiracy by misappropriating 1MDB money amounting to US$3.5 billion paid to Aabar Investments and US$1.265 billion paid to International Petroleum Investment Company (Ipic) on May 9, 2017
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It claimed that Irwan also conspired with Arul Kanda to cause the company to implement the employment extension agreement and made a substantial payment of RM2,905,200 to Arul Kanda in accordance with the agreement, regardless of 1MDB’s interests, causing the company to suffer losses and damages
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                1MDB demanded that the two defendants pay US$6.59 billion for the breach and an additional RM2.9 million from Irwan in relation to the employment extension agreement

                The second charge was for approving a payment of RM1,360,716 payment to JSD Corporation Pte Ltd at the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited in Singapore also without approval of the BNS board

                In its report released on August 8, Parliament's bipartisan watchdog Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said BNS was awarded a RM9.128 billion 10-year contract from 2013 to 2023 for the supply of the six LCS

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The PAC report also said the Malaysian government had to date already paid RM6.083 billion to the contractor, but none of the six LCS vessels has been completed

                Ambassador Hermono said the lawyer, appointed by the republic’s consul in Tawau, Heni Hamidah, will work alongside the lawyer provided by Engrit Liaw, the general secretary of the Sabah Timber Industries Employees’ Union (STIEU)

                The Tawau (consulate) always consults me and also the foreign affairs ministry in Jakarta to find solutions to seek justice for Sabri.”  Hermono said the consulate is also seeking a special pass for Sabri from the immigration department in Sabah as his work pass expired two days ago

                Reuters reported yesterday that a court in military-ruled Myanmar handed down the sentence after finding Suu Kyi guilty in four corruption cases, after she had already been sentenced to 11 years in prison in other cases

                Suu Kyi has denied all the charges against her

                “The additional sentencing of Suu Kyi and the recent execution of four democracy activists prove that the junta repeatedly disregards calls by Asean leaders for concrete and inclusive dialogue for national reconciliation in Myanmar,” said Saifuddin in a tweet

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Suu Kyi, a 77-year-old Nobel laureate and the figurehead of Myanmar’s opposition to military rule, has been charged with at least 18 offences ranging from corruption to election violations, carrying combined maximum jail terms of nearly 190 years

                About Us Advertise   PUTRAJAYA, Aug 16 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob today said the government led by him is a joint-government that emphasises the Malaysian Family (Keluarga Malaysia) concept

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As such, he said, it would be apt for civil servants to defend the government against any allegation and slander that said the government under his administration has failed

                At a meeting with the staff of the Prime Minister’s Department (JPM) here today, Ismail Sabri said civil servants should defend the government by looking at him as the head of the government and not as a political party leader

                Mizan Mohammad Aslam of Universiti Malaysia Perlis said doing so would prevent leakages in the procurement of military assets from recurring

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mizan also said the time had come for the country to rope in experts from the 21 public universities to develop it’s own military technology
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was commenting on the controversy surrounding the littoral combat ship (LCS) project

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The project has come under much scrutiny after Parliament’s PAC chairman Wong Kah Woh revealed that not a single ship had been completed although Putrajaya had spent RM6 billion on the project, which was given to Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd through direct negotiations
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mizan also called for the government to set up a committee to look into whether the debate over the LCS project had compromised the nation’s security
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the government should show that it was not compromising on any alleged weaknesses in its procurement processes by taking “stern action” on those involved in any wrongdoing in the LCS project

                In the first charge, he is accused of approving a payment of RM13,541,140 to Setaria Holding Limited at the Standard Chartered Bank, 6 Battery RD, Singapore 049909 without approval from the BNS board

                In its report released on August 8, Parliament's bipartisan watchdog Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said BNS was awarded a RM9.128 billion 10-year contract from 2013 to 2023 for the supply of the six LCS

                PBM secretary-general Nor Hizwan Ahmad said the party respects the BN Supreme Council’s decision last night to postpone a decision on the party’s application to join the coalition
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “PBM appreciates BN’s decision to discuss this matter more thoroughly before an official decision is made,” said Nor Hizwan in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “PBM’s Supreme Council is also ready to negotiate with the BN Supreme Council if there are any issues or matters that need to be clarified.” The BN Supreme Council had been expected to make a decision on PBM’s application at its meeting last night

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                PBM is led by Ampang MP Zuraida Kamaruddin, who said on Tuesday her party would accept whatever decision BN made about its application, submitted in July

                Khaled praised Ismail, a fellow Umno vice-president, for being brave in abolishing import permits (APs) for food “especially since the AP is perceived to be a curse that people avoid”

            <p> </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The anti-hopping bill was one of the reforms demanded by Pakatan Harapan in return for keeping Ismail’s government in office

                Earlier this week, Jeniri said Warisan was still struggling for support in Sabah while Peninsular Malaysians were uninterested in what they regarded as a “Sabah-based party”

                Lee, who previously predicted that Warisan would struggle in Peninsular Malaysia, said the party should not stretch itself after losing its chance to prove that it could run the state government

                In an interview on Monday with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, Wong said the relationship between the world’s biggest economies was on a “very worrying” trajectory in the wake of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and China’s subsequent military drills around the island
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As they say, no one deliberately wants to go into battle, but we sleep walk into conflict,” he added
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “And that’s the biggest problem and danger.” Wong expressed concern about a potential accident in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea, citing a 2001 incident when an American spy plane made an emergency landing on China’s southern Hainan Island after colliding with a Chinese jet
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                A city-state dependent on trade, Singapore supports a strong American presence in Asia by allowing the US to access military facilities while also counting China as its top trading partner

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wong said the international community is entering a “new world order” in which trade, economics and finance are used as “instruments of geopolitical contests.” “The old logic used to be that with more trade we can tamp down geopolitical rivalries,” he said

                Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a ceremony opening the international military-technical forum Army-2022 at Patriot Congress and Exhibition Centre in the Moscow region, Russia August 15, 2022

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Putin used a speech at an arms show near Moscow to boast of Russia's advanced weapons capabilities and declare its willingness to share technology with like-minded countries
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "(We) are ready to offer our allies the most modern types of weapons, from small arms to armored vehicles and artillery to combat aviation and unmanned aerial vehicles," Putin said at the opening ceremony of the "Army-2022" forum near Moscow

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Western military analysts say the poor performance of Russian troops and weaponry could make its arms exports less attractive to potential buyers, such as India, which have heavily relied on its technology in the past

                Rahman indicated that the price hike for spare parts could be as much as 60 per cent, depending on what needed replacements

                The committee chairman, former chief forest conservator Sam Mannan, said the Sabah Foundation would take the lead in carbon exchange deals

                Mannan, currently technical adviser on forestry to the Sabah chief minister, said the committee believed that Sabah did not need a third party to venture into business dealings on the carbon exchange market

                Lawyers for Animal Rights spokesman Rajesh Nagarajan says it has sent a letter of demand (LOD) calling on MPK to take disciplinary action and the DVS to charge the perpetrators under Section 29 of the Animal Welfare Act 2015

                "Fishermen in the area said large fish, especially the alu-alu fish (yellowtail barracuda) could be hunting the anchovies forcing them to jump onto the beach,” she said, adding that the bright lights in the area might also lure the anchovies to the beach
