                "JPSM sees this as a violation of terms, because the Musang King is not a forest plantation species and despite that, there are 5,000 trees planted in an area of 52ha in Gunung Inas," Takiyuddin said during Minister Question Time in Parliament on Tuesday (July 26) morning

                Takiyuddin said the JPSM had proposed to the Kedah government to gazette Gunung Inas as a forest reserve, so that it could act as a water catchment area

                Khairy said that the disruption of supply was due to the total lockdown in China where most of the supply for active ingredients for pharmaceutical products are produced and the Russia-Ukraine war where an ingredient which is added to the active ingredient was produced

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairy (BN-Rembau) added that the ministry has also agreed to release its stockpile to the private sector

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                To ensure the country's drug security and self-reliance in times of crisis, local pharmaceutical companies are encouraged to produce their own active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) through public-private partnerships
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In addition to that, Khairy added that the ministry would also advocate pharmaceutical product patency by strengthening its cooperation with the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia to prevent patent ever-greening

                In a related note, Khairy said the ministry was looking into the implementation of price control through the price transparency mechanism

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 — Any party or person with the view that a new agreement should be drawn up to replace the 1963 Malaysia Agreement (MA63) has a distorted view of the country’s national struggle, said Datuk Seri Maximus Ongkili
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Replying to a query from Datuk Mohd Azis Jamman (Warisan-Sepanggar), the minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Sabah and Sarawak Affairs) said that the government is committed to fully implementing the conditions set in MA63, as the document was sacred and laid the foundation of the formation of Malaysia

                Earlier this month, Barisan Nasional deputy chairman Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan proposed at the Sabah BN Convention that a new Malaysia Agreement be drawn up

                A supporter of a new agreement was Datuk Jeffrey Kitingan (STAR-Keningau), who admitted that he wanted MA63 to be replaced as he was of the view that the agreement was not respected and implemented

                I used to worry whether my ex-husband was beating and torturing them like he used to do to me.” It is the latest case in multi-ethnic Malaysia of a so-called “unilateral conversion” to Islam — one parent converting a child’s religion without the other’s permission

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Loh said those who sided with her ex-husband’s decision to convert the children from Hinduism to Islam, and sought to keep them separated from her, were not respecting the top court’s decision

                “They are stopping their children from being with their mother.” Loh has a mixed background, with an ethnic Chinese father and ethnic Indian mother

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “It is all about power and control.” Loh’s saga is not over, with her lawyers challenging the children’s conversion to Islam in court, arguing it was unconstitutional

                The influential Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party — an Islamist group that forms part of the national government — urged Loh not to challenge the conversion

                Puad Zarkashi said the RoS promised to inform the party on the status of the application by July 16

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If the amendment is approved, Umno will be allowed to postpone its party elections by up to six months after a general election or up to 18 months from the end of its leadership’s term, whichever comes later
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Puad said the RoS had tarnished its credibility by taking so much time on a simple matter  “RoS has no right to dictate an organisation or political party’s constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This is the right of any registered organisation,” he said, adding Umno had followed the book in amending its constitution
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This is not about Umno wanting to postpone polls, this is about Umno amending its constitution

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                If other parties can get a response (to their application) within a week, why does Umno have to wait so long

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 — Lawyer Gobind Singh Deo today challenged the validity of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) investigation on Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman after an investigator appeared ignorant of basic facts relevant to his fraud trial
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Nurul could not recall when she spoke to Syed Saddiq’s father or name the officer who was in charge of speaking to Syed Saddiq during the investigation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She also disagreed with Gobind that during an election, money could be advanced and reimbursed later despite being shown several related payments
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As Gobind maintained the line of questioning, Nurul Hidayah began repeating her previous answers regardless of the question

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                During cross examination earlier today, Nurul insisted that RM100,000 from this went from Maybank Islamic Bhd account belonging to Armada Bumi Bersatu Enterprise (ABBE) into Syed Saddiq’s personal bank account in two payments of RM50,000
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Syed Saddiq also faces two counts of engaging in money laundering activities, namely two transactions of RM50,000, believed to be proceeds of unlawful activities, from his Maybank Islamic Bhd account into his Amanah Saham Bumiputera account, on June 16 and 19, 2018

                About Us Advertise LONDON, July 25 — Rishi Sunak yesterday promised to get tough on China if he becomes Britain’s next prime minister, calling the Asian superpower the “number one threat” to domestic and global security
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                China’s state-run Global Times has previously said Sunak was the only candidate in the contest with “a clear and pragmatic view on developing UK-China ties”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Yet British government policy when both Sunak and Truss were in Johnson’s cabinet has warned about China before
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In March last year, its integrated review of security, defence and foreign policy called China “the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                At the same time, London has recognised that China’s power and international assertiveness was here to stay, and called Beijing a “systemic competitor”
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In July last year, Sunak himself called for a more nuanced approach to the debate on China

                Lawyer Joshua Tan said judge Nik Hasmat Nik Mohamed granted the application after an online proceeding today

                “The defendant cannot post the same or similar articles on its news portal until the final determination of the suit,” said Joshua who appeared with Ragunath Kesavan for Ismail

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lawyer Asiah Abdul Jalil represented Agenda Daily and its owner, Izwan Mohd Zubit, as defendants in the suit

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Ismail filed the suit in February against the defendant for publishing an article titled “Ismail Sabri bimbang jadi PM paling singkat, ‘rayu’ jangan tarik sokongan”, saying it implied that he had begged his Perikatan Nasional allies for their continued support
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his statement of claim, Ismail said the posting, in its ordinary meaning and by inference, meant that he was concerned about ending up as the prime minister with the shortest tenure in Malaysian history

                According to a statement issued on Saturday (July 22) by Nunukan Immigration officer Saut Dompak, the six men had claimed to be looking into the possibility of building a bridge from Sebatik to Tawau

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                One of the Indonesians arrested reportedly had two sets of identification documents, an Indonesian passport and a Malaysian identity card

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Initial investigations indicated that the Indonesian with two sets of papers had invited the China national and Malaysians to look at the possibility of building a bridge from Tawau to Sebatik on July 20
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Indonesian navy officers found photographs of sensitive areas of their border post and marine headquarters in Sebatik

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                At 29, Dusty is in a wheelchair and severely impacted by Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a muscle-wasting disease that affects one in 3,500 boys

                When Dusty was diagnosed with the rare condition in the 1990s, Jayasuriya founded Coalition Duchenne, a non-profit organisation that aims to raise global awareness and funding for the condition

                Dusty and the challenges faced by people with Duchenne have inspired Ravi Everest, Coalition Duchenne’s official climbing partner, to become involved with the cause

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 — Residents of Desa Sri Hartamas and Segambut MP Hannah Yeoh gathered today to object to a proposed development plan that they say will contribute to the traffic congestion in the area
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The noticeboard also displayed a picture suggesting a high-rise office building and a condominium will be built on the land
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “There’s no way a higher plot ratio here will increase the quality of life of our residents because of the congestion that is already here,” she added
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is understood that the proposed development plan involves land with a water sewage facility
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Multiple local representatives also spoke about the negative impact that a high-density development plan would have on the already congested road
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In addition, president of Desa Sri Hartamas Owners and Traders Association Abu Bakar Ibrahim said that DBKL should conduct a traffic impact assessment, environment impact assessment, and social impact assessment of the proposed development plan to make sure that the neighbourhood remains liveable

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Investigating officer Nurul Hidayah Kamaruddin, however, insisted that the reason she did not record statements regarding the election campaign and expenditure for it was because they were not related to her scope of investigation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She had also concluded from her investigation that Syed Saddiq didn’t use the RM120,000 for the general election campaign as he claimed
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Nurul Hidayah, who is the 28th prosecution witness, couldn’t explain from her investigation where the remaining RM20,000 went
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gobind then asked Nurul Hidayah if she knew that Syed Saddiq had submitted the statement of the campaign expenditure in relation to GE14 totalling RM171,675 to the Election Commission
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                However, Gobind reiterated that Nurul Hidayah did not investigate that possibility, including how much was actually needed and used for the campaign and how much of the advance payment was received, as well as how it was spent
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Again, Nurul Hidayah maintained that her investigation only revolved around the RM120,000

                Shahril was among the latest to be implicated today by UKSB executives testifying against Ahmad Zahid, joining others such as Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin and former prime ministers Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Under questioning from the defence, UKSB administrative manager David Tan Siong Sun told the High Court this morning that Shahril received a total of RM1.16 million for political funding purposes by virtue of being a close ally of Khairy
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Tan referred to Shahril as “S Pat” in his ledger, which was shown to the court today
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The other two were former MCA leaders Tan Sri Chan Kong Choy and Tan Sri Ong Ka Chuan

                Ahmad Zahid is facing 33 charges of receiving bribes amounting to S$13.56 million (RM42 million) from UKSB as an inducement for himself in his capacity as a civil servant and the then home minister to extend the contract of the company as the operator of the OSCs in China and the VLN system as well as to maintain the agreement to supply VLN integrated system paraphernalia to the same company by the Home Ministry

                For another seven counts, the current Umno president was charged as home minister to have obtained for himself S$1.15 million, RM3 million, €15,000 and US$15,000 in cash from the same company in connection with his official work
