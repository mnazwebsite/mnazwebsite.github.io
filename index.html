                The Home Minister acknowledged that he was aware of the allegations involving the Public Service Department (PSD) director-general

                Earlier on Wednesday, the Malaysian Immigration Enforcers Association and Immigration Services Union of Peninsular Malaysia released statements on the incident, with alleged accounts of the incident making its rounds on social media

                The KLIA Immigration Operations head, who was identified as James Lee, was said to have been at the receiving end because there were no Immigration officers stationed at the VIP room between 8.40am and 9.40am on Wednesday.

                “The report found that the project was not handled efficiently, reflected in the weakness of the EoT (extension of time), maintenance and ICP (industry collaboration programme),” it said

                To overcome the weaknesses raised and to ensure the mistakes are not repeated in the future, the auditor-general proposed that the transport ministry review all the contract terms to ensure that the interests of the government are protected

                Bernama reported that the report also said the programme did not achieve its targeted performance, as some participants did not generate sufficient income to rise above the poverty line

                That same agency, it said, failed to carry out repair works approved for 113 participants, while some RM1.08 million was returned to the finance ministry in 2016 following the housing and local government ministry’s failure to implement the programme

                About Us Advertise BALING, Aug 3 — The Musang King durian farm project in Gunung Inas here was not the cause of the debris flow tragedy on July 4 in Baling district that claimed three lives, said Kedah Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said none of the reservoirs on the project had burst as claimed by certain parties
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When asked to make comment on the statement by Minister of Environment and Water, Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man in a previous media report that said the flood was caused by a burst reservoir that on the durian farm project, he said the minister’s statement actually mentioned the “possibility” of this occurrence and it was not based on accurate facts
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Meanwhile, commenting on the flood incident that happened in several villages in Mukim Baling yesterday which was allegedly caused by the flow of water from Gunung Inas, Muhammad Sanusi said the cause of the flood incident has not yet been ascertained yet
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In another development, he said the Musang King durian farm project in the Rimba Teloi Permanent Forest Reserve (HSK), Sik will continue even though there is a possible risk of unwanted incidents in the area
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                Dr Mahathir added that if there was no evidence to support the claim, he considered Apandi's statement libellous and that he had the right to take legal action
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former prime minister was responding to four questions posed by Apandi on Facebook last month, including on the Batu Puteh case, the Sulu claim, and his dismissal suit as AG
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He added that Apandi's actions also showed negligence in claiming that Najib was innocent

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On the question of why he unilaterally withdrew Malaysia’s bid to overturn the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) 2008 ruling on Batu Puteh, Dr Mahathir said it was in respect of an earlier agreement with Singapore
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "If Malaysia had not dropped the claim, Indonesia would also have grounds to claim both the Sipadan and Ligitan islands off Sabah," he said

                "New facts on Batu Puteh, if present, should also be presented to the international courts when making a representation that Batu Puteh indeed belonged to Malaysia," he said.

                Asbi Munip, 32, said this was because the money laundering case investigation was focused on the transfer of RM100,000 from Syed Saddiq’s personal Maybank account to his Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) account

                According to a report by The New Zealand Herald, the 46-year-old Malaysian, who now identifies as female, served the entirety of her five-year sentence and continued to deny her offence

                An MACC source said the eight detainees included the CEO of an IT company in his 50s, who allegedly received bribes of between RM800 and RM1,500

                MACC senior investigations director Hishamuddin Hashim confirmed the arrests, adding that the case was being investigated under Section 16(a) of the MACC Act

                The four Penang assemblymen are Dr Afif Bahardin (Seberang Jaya, ex-PKR), Zulkifli Ibrahim (Sg Acheh, ex-PKR), Khaliq Mehtab Mohd Ishaq (Bertam, Bersatu but pro-PN), and Zolkifly Md Lazim (Telok Bahang, Bersatu but pro-PN)

                The four Penang assemblymen had previously filed an injunction against the Penang legislature from passing a motion to vacate their seats after they decided to support PN

                In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that Kelantan’s state law barring party hopping was illegal as it violated Article 10(1)(c) of the Federal Constitution on freedom of association

                "They will also be given a third dose vaccine at an interval of at least eight weeks from the second dose," he told The Star on Wednesday (Aug 3)

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The first booster shot will be administered at least three months after the third dose

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                As for children aged between five and 11 years old who were moderately or severely immunocompromised, they will also be given a third dose vaccine at an interval of at least eight weeks after the second dose
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Dr Noor Azmi said this in response to The Star's request for clarification on whether or not the second booster will be administered to all teenagers

                He had said in the Dewan Rakyat earlier that the first booster shot administered to teenagers had been re-categorised as the third dose to complete their primer vaccination

                "This means three months after completing their third dose, they can take their first booster and after four to six months they can take the second booster," he said during the Oral Question and Answer in the Dewan Rakyat on Wednesday (Aug 3)

                He was responding to a question by Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh, who wanted to know whether investigation papers had been opened against Mustapa, deputy law minister Mas Ermieyati Samsuddin and deputy health minister Dr Noor Azmi Ghazali following reports lodged with MACC on alleged misappropriation of funds or party allocations worth tens of millions of ringgit

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Zahid claimed that the Jeli MP, who was also the Kelantan Umno chief, had taken more than RM30 million that was supposed to be used to bring home Kelantan residents from the Klang Valley to vote in the state
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The former home minister claimed the money had been set aside but not spent

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He also said the Masjid Tanah MP had been entrusted with funds to manage Puteri Umno in GE14, but claimed it was transferred to another account for her personal use
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Zahid then claimed that the Bagan Serai MP’s brother had misappropriated funds meant for development in the constituency

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Gobind said Syed Saddiq had raised “various defences” to justify a transfer of RM100,000 into his Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) account as well as a RM120,000 deposit into his bank account when the authorities recorded his statements in 2020

                In reply, Asbi said his investigation focused on the transfer of RM100,000 from Syed Saddiq’s Maybank account to his ASB account between June 16 and June 19, 2018

                In January, activist groups in Sabah questioned the identity of Sabah MIC chief Peer Mohamad Kadir, who allegedly shares the same name as an individual from India who entered the state in 1984, and was a witness in the Royal Commission of Inquiry (RCI) on illegal immigration in Sabah in 2013

                Its chief, Nuridah Salleh, said Oktoberfest was not appropriate here because it would be viewed as an open invitation to encourage drinking, which would pose a danger for all Malaysians

                “Everyone knows that it has been proven that drinking does not only endanger the lives of those consuming alcohol, but also their families and society

                He said non-Muslims were not prohibited from consuming alcohol, but the Oktoberfest events could trigger social problems since they were held in a public setting and alcohol was consumed openly

                In a statement today, he alleged Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as among leaders who made such remarks when the latter labelled the "Pakatan Harapan government as being a DAP government", as well as twisting facts and numbers on DAP, when it was in government under PH

                Ismail Sabri reportedly said the move "unconstitutionally and undemocratically toppled the elected Pakatan Harapan government" after 22 months, on the grounds of DAP's dominance in the PH government

                Marcos Jr's recent statement about the country's territory, Cruz-Angeles explained, also still needs to be clarified

                “The President’s articulation of his statement about not giving up a square inch of territory will have to be reduced into writing and into specifics, after which, we will announce these to you if they are in any way related to the Sabah claim," she said

                However, without knowing the decision of the Madrid Court to cancel Stampa's appointment as an arbitrator, a French arbitration court went ahead with the Sulu descendants' case against Malaysia last September

                On Feb 28 this year, the Paris Arbitration Court awarded the Sulu heirs US$14.92bil (RM66.4bil) from Malaysia

                It followed a U.N.-brokered grain and fertiliser export agreement between Moscow and Kyiv last month - a rare diplomatic breakthrough in a drawn-out war of attrition

                in partnership with Turkey, we had a first ship with the delivery of grain, but it’s still nothing

                He said Ukraine, one of the world's top grain producers before the war, had to export a minimum 10 million tonnes of grain to urgently help bring down its budget deficit which was running at $5 billion a month
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the grain shipment but also said it was "only a first step"

                Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the grain deal might offer a way forward out of conflict

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 – Malaysia’s public health care system, which charges RM1 and RM5 for outpatient and specialist care respectively in Ministry of Health (MOH) facilities, is unsustainable, Khairy Jamaluddin said
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The government is aware that the existing public health financing model is not sustainable and will put additional pressure on the federal expenditure
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “As such, the government is currently studying various future-proof health financing options to strengthen the country’s health care system as a whole so that health services are more equitable, have high standards, easily accessible at a reasonable cost, and are sustainable in the long run
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khairy said the government will use a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to ensure that the people’s health interests are protected in the implementation of any health financing system in the future

                India fulfils two-thirds of its vegetable oil demand through imports of around 14 million tonnes annually, including around 8.5 million tonnes of palm oil

                Even if Telangana manages to grow oil palm on only 1 million acres and produces 2 million tonnes of palm oil, it would be a huge achievement, said Chava Venkateswara Rao of Godrej Agrovet Ltd GODE.NS, the country's biggest palm oil producer

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Until last year, the country was adding around 35,000 acres under oil palm every year

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Now, with the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project, we have ample water for oil palm," said farmer Bollampalli Venkateshwar Rao, who planted oil palms on 12 acres

                Ravi Mathur, who heads the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research (IIOPR), a government-backed body spearheading the oil palm push, said the lift irrigation project has made oil palm planting feasible in areas previously unsuitable for the crop because of water scarcity

                With the rate being restored to 11% after having been cut to 9% in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Universiti Putra Malaysia’s (UPM) Rusmawati Said cautioned that if employees are unable to save now, it would get complicated when they were older

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Last year, the employee’s share of the statutory contribution rate to EPF was reduced to 9% to boost disposable income during the pandemic
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In July, it was set back to 11%
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Rusmawati said an individual earning RM2,000 a month would contribute RM220 based on the current rate
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “When employees retire, they will have savings that would allow them to get by.” Barjoyai also said employees should not look at the amount deducted for such contributions as a loss as the sum would eventually “return” with interest
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “EPF isn’t a tax but a long-term saving scheme,” he said, adding that this was the best time to revert to the 11% rate to ensure that retirement plans would not be disrupted

                Political analyst Anantha Raman Govindasamy of Universiti Malaysia Sabah told FMT he believed Umno made a top-down rather than a grassroots decision in appointing Tengku Zafrul to the Selangor post
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                So we just need to wait and see how Umno tries to repackage him, rebuild his image and sell him to the grassroots

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “I think he will be repackaged in such a way that he will be seen as one of the clear candidates to help Umno take over Selangor

                Sheikh Moqhtar Kadir said the PJD Link was merely a rebranding of the Kinrara Damansara Expressway (Kidex) that was cancelled in 2015 and removed from the Selangor State Structural Plan 2035 by the state government
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Based on this, why did the ministry not exclude PJD Link from the Malaysia Highway Authority’s Highway Network Development Plan (HNDP) 2030?” said Moqhtar, the chairman of the Coalition Against PJD Link Highway, in a statement
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “How was PJD Link given its approval in principle when Kidex was to be removed from the Selangor State Structural Plan 2035?” He noted that menteri besar Amirudin Shari had “confirmed (Kidex’s) rebranding” at a PKR political bureau meeting last September
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Moqhtar said the coalition was seeking Fadillah’s consideration to review the validity of the PJD Link’s concession agreement since the minister had acknowledged the cancellation of Kidex in Parliament in 2016
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                His statement comes a day after Fadillah met with representatives of “Say No To PJD Link”, a group of Selangor residents against the planned highway, to assure them that the project would have to get the state government’s nod, and approval by the works ministry, before going ahead

                It’s not practical when you consider that construction costs have gone up and developers are having a hard time meeting the demand for affordable housing.” Juwairiya was commenting on Selangor MCA chief Ng Chok Sin’s remarks that the price of affordable homes in Selangor should be reduced by half if BN wrests control of the state in GE15

                On March 24, Judicial Commissioner Datuk Mohd Arief Emran Arifin ordered the Pekan Member of Parliament to disclose to SRC’s lawyers in writing his assets in or outside Malaysia, up to the value of RM42 million within 30 days after the order has been served on Najib

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Mohd Arief Emran directed that Najib must not remove, dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of any of the assets in and outside Malaysia up to the value of RM42 million, pending the final determination of the suit

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Najib also disclosed that he had a total of RM1.24 million in an Affin Bank account and a deposit of RM2.52 million with Amanah Saham Nasional Berhad

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Through the affidavit filed on April 25, Najib confirmed that he did not have assets amounting to RM42 million

                On July 28, 2020, the High Court sentenced Najib to 12 years in jail and fined RM210 million after he was found guilty of misappropriating RM42 million belonging to SRC

                Penang mufti, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Salim Wan Mohd Noor said it proved that coming from different ethnic and religious backgrounds was not an obstacle to establishing a good and cordial relationship between individuals

                "In my view, this very cordial relationship between a mother and her adopted daughter from a different race and religion shows a unique and very meaningful one

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Wan Salim said Islam indeed enjoined such a relationship even between parents and children professing different religions, as the family relationship must remain and not severed in any situation

                "In maintaining a good and cordial relationship between the child and parents in such a situation, it is a must in Islam for the child to obey the real parents as long as he or she is not asked to do something that is ‘syirik’ (polytheism), involving in vice or other things deemed unIsIamic
