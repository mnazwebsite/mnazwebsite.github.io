                Nearly 80% of Penang’s tap water is sourced from Sungai Muda, which flows from two other rivers upstream of Baling

                When Baling was hit by floods earlier this month, water supply to Penang was interrupted for at least three days

                In a statement, Penang Water Supply Corp (PBAPP) said the nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) level – the standard measurement of how turbid the raw water supply is – remained at a normal reading of 261

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Bangi MP Ong Kian Ming said the decision to ban chicken exports, which he said “may look like a workable short-term solution”, had ended up hurting chicken producers and chicken imports instead
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This impact was felt most strongly in Singapore, which imports one-third of its chicken supplies from Malaysia, including almost all of its live chickens.” The DAP MP pointed out that the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) announced a list of new farms and establishments which could export chicken products to Singapore, including from Australia, Brazil and Thailand, as well as the approval of three establishments in Indonesia to export chicken meat and related meat products to the country
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the agriculture and food industries ministry must understand that the path to food security was not through providing enough supply for the domestic market, but also by producing enough supply to export to foreign markets
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Instead of harming local chicken farmers by short-term policies such as the export ban and by putting in price controls that are not reflective of the underlying cost of production, Mafi (the ministry) should be putting in place plans to help our chicken farmers expand their domestic production and access to foreign markets.” Ong suggested that the ministry work together with the Federation of Livestock Farmers Association of Malaysia to provide soft loans through Agrobank for long-term investments and expansion in this sector
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said market access for chicken producers should be expanded to other countries, including the halal markets in the Middle East

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the ministry should assure export markets, especially Singapore, that such export bans would not be implemented again and that contractual sanctity would be respected

                This means the MoU sealed on 13 September 2021 remains in force as long as the 14th Parliament is not dissolved as stated in Item 2.1 of the MoU “Therefore, the presidential council orders Pakatan Harapan representatives in the MoU steering committee to carry out meetings immediately with government representatives to discuss several matters in the MoU that are still outstanding, besides studying matters stated by the prime minister including related to political funding,” they said in a joint statement today

                Liew, however, pointed out that whatever happens in Johor will have national consequences and the state election showed that Umno has not recouped its losses or rebuilt itself

                But a distraught Razma returned home at about 8pm only to find in shock the remnants of her house that had collapsed after it was hit by a landslide moments earlier

                Indonesia, said Saravanan, had also agreed to integrate the existing system between Malaysia’s Immigration Department and its embassy in Kuala Lumpur for the recruitment of Indonesian domestic workers (PDI)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said the integration of this system would act as a single channel for the recruitment and entry of PDI into Malaysia as agreed in the previous Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This system will be operational in three more weeks under the supervision of the Malaysia-Indonesia Joint Working Group,” he said in a statement with his Indonesian counterpart, Ida Fauziyah, as reported by Bernama
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “Therefore, the Indonesian side has agreed to withdraw the restrictions on the entry of PDI and Indonesian labourers (TKI) into Malaysia starting Aug 1 (Monday),” said Saravanan

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saravanan was in Jakarta in conjunction with the meeting of the Joint Working Group between Malaysia and Indonesia as outlined in the MOU regarding the PDI, which was completed on July 27
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                She added that the effectiveness of the implementation of the commitments made in the MOU was also important before Indonesia sent the PDI back to Malaysia in August.

                “Along with the expectation that gross domestic product (GDP) growth would continue to be driven by the stronger recovery in domestic demand, we expect Bank Negara to maintain its hawkish tilt and raise the OPR by at least 25 bps each at its remaining two MPC meetings for this year,” said Kenanga

                Persatuan Harapan India Malaysia chairman M Mani Maran received 16 stitches at the hospital following the attack in Kajang

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                In his police report, Mani alleged that the assailant – believed to be in his late 30s – was the same person who had approached him outside the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) headquarters in Putrajaya after he lodged a report against a Cabinet member on July 22

                Recalling the attack, Mani said he just left a printing shop around 1.40pm in Kajang yesterday, when his attacker approached him and asked him about a certain individual

                However, the news was untrue and Khalid was still under treatment at a private hospital

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When contacted, Khalid's former political secretary Faekah Husin said it was a callous act to spread such a rumour
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The post by Khalid's team, on his official Facebook Timeline, also demanded that the rumour be immediately stopped out of respect for the former mentri besar's family as they were already facing a difficult time
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                It is understood that Khalid is suffering from kidney failure and undergoes dialysis

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khalid had also undergone an open-heart surgery sometime earlier this year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Khalid was a prolific mentri besar during his tenure from 2008 to 2014 and being a stickler for efficiency, ensured the smooth running of the state government machinery
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Being frugal, Khalid also held on very tightly to the state’s purse strings which saw Selangor’s coffers having a healthy balance
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He was ousted by his party PKR in 2014 which saw Khalid vacating the mentri besar’s position and then assumed by former party deputy president Datuk Seri Azmin Ali.

                Lawyer Siva Kumar Kanagasabai, representing 1MDB, said that based on their last known addresses, Low May Lin was in Singapore while her younger brother, Taek Szen, was in Hong Kong

                On Dec 29 last year, Jho Low, his father Larry Low and his mother Goh Gaik Ewe entered an appearance in the suit as defendants while the writ of summons had yet to be served on another defendant, Jho Low’s associate Eric Tan

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Based on the writ, 1MDB is claiming US$661 million from Jho Low and US$41 million, US$397 million, US$608 million and US$1.9 billion from Jho Low and Tan as well as US$325 million from Jho Low and his father

                State labour department director Wan Zulkifli Wan Setapa said there was a worrying trend every year as 200,000 residents were recorded leaving Sabah in search of job opportunities
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                He said Sabah also relied on foreign workers in the plantation, construction, restaurant and agricultural sectors, and according to immigration department data, there were more than 135,000 non-resident workers in the state, more than 50% of whom were Indonesians
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “If the relocation of the Indonesian capital to Kalimantan in 2024 attracts Indonesians who are working in Sabah, (even) if 50% of these (Indonesian) workers leave, the state economy could collapse

                “Related parties need to look at the matter in order to find an alternative or exit policy to overcome and resolve the (labour) issue,” he said when speaking at the 2022 Sabah Labour Convention here

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                When met by reporters later, he said all parties needed to brace themselves for the eventuality because the two-year horizon was not that distant as Sabah was already facing a labour crisis

                About Us Advertise KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 — The Oktoberfest event should not be openly celebrated and held as a festival open to the public, said Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Idris Ahmad
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Lim had asked the Prime Minister to state the government's stance in the celebration of Bon Odori and Oktoberfest, which are Japanese and German cultural events under the auspices of their respective embassies
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On Bon Odori, Idris said that while the government didn't stop the event from happening, but only advised Muslims from not attending the event, as a study by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (Jakim) alleged that the festival contained elements from other religions and has ceremonies that are contrary to the teachings of Islam
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                On June 6, Idris advised Muslims not to participate in the Bon Odori Festival that was to be held at the Shah Alam Sports Complex on July 16, as the festival contains elements of other religions
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Idris was told to attend the annual event himself "so that he could learn to make the distinction between culture and religion”, a sharp and direct censure rarely made by a monarch
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Bon Odori simply means the "Bon dance”, which is performed during Obon, an annual event when the Japanese honour the spirits of their ancestors.

                The Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Religious Affairs) said non-Muslims are not forbidden from consuming alcohol, but the Oktoberfest events could trigger social problems as alcohol is consumed openly in a festival setting

                Islam is the federal religion,” said Idris
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Idris also said the government isn't against the Bon Odori festival by the Japanese Embassy as it is a cultural celebration of the Japanese based on their traditions and beliefs
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Idris advised Muslims not to be present at such cultural event as preliminary studies and observations by the Islamic Development Department (Jakim) have shown that it has teachings of other religion and is against Islam
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Recently, Idris came into controversy after he told Muslims to stay away from the event as he said it had "elements of other religions"
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                This led to Selangor Ruler Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah ordering the state Islamic Religious Department (Jais) not to prevent any individual from attending the festival

                Working at a restaurant here, the 36-year-old mother of three had left their squatter home near Taman Elok in Bukit Nenas here for work like any other day, without any inkling of the fate that would befall her and her family

                “When the landslip occurred, all my children were at home with my parents but I never thought such an incident would take place as it has never happened while we lived there,” she said, when met at the site on Thursday (July 28)

                This is following a decision by the High Court that allowed the striking out application filed by Ikhwan Hafiz Jamaludin, 35, and Nur Anis Jamaludin, 37, on the grounds of res judicata

                In her brief judgment, High Court Justice Hayatul Akmal Abdul Aziz said Aminah, 88, had filed the suit based on substantially similar facts and issues on the administration of the estate of the deceased (Jamaludin) that she had already raised before a different court

                She said on June 23, 2017, Nur Anis and Ikhwan applied for letters of administration of their father's estate at the High Court and they were granted the letters of administration on July 6, 2017

                On Aug 31, last year, High Court judge Justice Mohd Firuz Jaffril partially allowed Aminah's application for a declaration that she was entitled to be a beneficiary to the former minister’s estate and has an interest in companies worth over RM1bil owned by his children

                The Perikatan chairman (Muhyiddin) was once the prime minister and he should've thought about the people and country's interest, not about the component party's interest to fill up positions," said Mahfuz

                JT International Bhd general manager Khoo Bee Leng said the government’s proposed Tobacco and Smoking Control Bill, which is aimed at banning those born in 2007 onwards from buying and smoking cigarette and vape products, will not meet its objective
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “This bill will not meet its objective
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                “The tobacco industry is not the right market to start with this regulation unless enforcement can be guaranteed
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                There’s no point coming out with the new law if you cannot enforce the existing law.” Khoo said her company, which is part of Japan Tobacco International, did not support the bill as it was “discriminating” in nature since those born in 2006 and before could still buy the tobacco products
            </p>
            <p> </p>

                On top of that, she feared that the regulation would set a precedent for a new product category

                In a report lodged by Malaysian International Humanitarian Organisation (MHO) with the Kota Kinabalu police on Wednesday (July 27), Sabah MHO coordinator Jerry Jaimeh urged police to probe the alleged move to recruit locals in Lahad Datu to declare loyalty to the Sulu sultanate

                The Court of Appeal also upheld his 12-year jail sentence and RM210 million fine, which was also not paid

                Today, deputy public prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin submitted that Najib had obtained the stay of sentence and conviction “at one go” in the High Court, which was maintained by the Court of Appeal

                However, Devanandan said the prosecution’s argument that Peter was not entitled to stay his conviction because he had partially fulfilled his sentence, was flawed

                Saravanan believes that the resolution of the issues in the MoU of the PDI will lead to the smooth entry of Indonesian workers into Malaysia in the domestic service sector as well as other sectors that are allowed to employ foreign workers

                On July 13, Indonesia announced the decision to temporarily freeze the entry of all the country's workers into Malaysia for not using the single system as previously agreed
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Saravanan was in Jakarta in conjunction with the meeting of the Joint Working Group between Malaysia and Indonesia as outlined in the MoU regarding the PDI which was completed on July 27

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The Special Task Force on Jihad against Inflation, which was set up on June 29 and chaired by Communications and Multimedia Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa, was created to help Malaysians to deal with the rising cost of living
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                "It is necessary to establish such a task force because problems related to inflation and cost of living have been impacting the people since last year
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Urging Malaysians to give space to the special task force to resolve the issues related to inflation, Ariff Azly said the creation of the team is a preliminary step in the government’s efforts to address inflation
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                if it continues to be committed to its jihad (against inflation), I’m sure this special task force will realise its goals,” he added

                “I wish to announce that the government will once again be giving special goodies to any student with a PTPTN loan who has a first-class honours degree, whereby they are allowed to change their loans to be exempted from repayment without taking into account their economic background, race or religion,” he said when launching PTPTN’s 25th Silver Jubilee Anniversary celebrations at Matrade Exhibition and Convention Centre yesterday

                In continuing to deliver the good news, Ismail Sabri said that 3.67 million “Malaysian Family” members managed to further their studies thanks to PTPTN loan disbursements of RM66.87bil to date

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">

                The Singapore Court of Appeal said LFL had abused the system by joining the pair in filing a criminal motion seeking a review of an earlier decision to uphold the death sentences, The Straits Times reported
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Charles Yeo, the counsel for Singaporean Roslan Bakar and Sabahan Pausi Jefridin, was also ordered to pay S$4,000 in costs to the attorney-general
            </p>

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                The court said the motion filed by the duo and LFL caused the Singaporean attorney-general to incur unnecessary cost in both proceedings

            <p> </p>
            
            
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Roslan and Pausi were arrested in 2008 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death two years later

                The duo were initially scheduled to be sent to the gallows on Feb 16, but Yeo filed a criminal motion seeking a review of the apex court’s 2018 decision

                In a parliamentary written reply, he said the school-leaving examination for Chinese-medium high schools went against the National Education Policy

                “The National Education Policy was implemented through a national education system for the national language to be used as the main medium of instruction, a national curriculum to be used, and students to sit for the same examination

                By comparison, Radzi pointed out that Chinese-medium high schools used Mandarin as their medium of instruction while they had their own curriculum developed by the Chinese education group Dong Zong

                “Therefore, the UEC needs to adhere to the National Education Policy in order for the government to consider (recognising it) in the future,” he said

            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;font-weight: bold;">
                Radzi said the ministry had never channelled funds to these schools because they offered the UEC, which was not in line with the National Education Policy, the Education Act 1996 and other existing legislation
