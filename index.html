                By Kyle Knight Ubisoft has announced that they will be delaying the decommissioning of older Assassin’s Creed titles by one month, reportedly due to the publisher wanting to “reduce disruption” for their player base
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The decommissioning of older Ubisoft titles was due to take place on the 1st of September 2022, but has now been moved back by one month, to the 1st of October 2022
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a result, the team has reportedly been forced to move the decommission date to the beginning of October, in order to make the process as smooth as possible for those still playing older titles
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The publisher did express that DLC for single-player titles on PC, such as Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, Assassin’s Creed III (2012 release), Far Cry 3 and Splinter Cell Blacklist, will still be available to download and keep before the decommission date
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ubisoft also states, “There will be no impact to the same single-player DLC on consoles, and you will continue to be able to download and play them after 1 October 2022”

                An Unofficial Liverpool FC Blog  Surprise, Surprise! Liverpool are actually signing a midfielder in the form of Brazilian international, Arthur Melo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool are already facing multiple fitness issues in the center of the park and yet, they are signing an injury-prone player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This term, Arthur has not played a single game for the Bianconeri thus far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Let’s hope, we are not signing another Naby Keita-type player, who may have potential but spends a lot of time injured
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp said the Reds will move if the “right” player is available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unfortunately, it seems that for FSG, the “right” player is someone who can be brought on loan without any obligation to buy (remember Ozan Kabak)

                An Unofficial Liverpool FC Blog  Surprise, Surprise! Liverpool are actually signing a midfielder in the form of Brazilian international, Arthur Melo
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Liverpool are already facing multiple fitness issues in the center of the park and yet, they are signing an injury-prone player
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This term, Arthur has not played a single game for the Bianconeri thus far
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Let’s hope, we are not signing another Naby Keita-type player, who may have potential but spends a lot of time injured
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jurgen Klopp said the Reds will move if the “right” player is available
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unfortunately, it seems that for FSG, the “right” player is someone who can be brought on loan without any obligation to buy (remember Ozan Kabak)

            <p>
                Hybrid OLED panels refer to OLED panels that use both rigid OLED panel and flexible OLED panel technologies […] A hybrid OLED panel uses a glass substrate like rigid OLED panels do but also uses the thin-film encapsulation of flexible OLED panels

            <p>
                OLED panel makers Samsung and LG are also working on a next-generation tech known as Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG), which might also be ready in time for the first OLED iPad

                The image points to quest-related DLC What appears to be a leaked Assassin's Creed Mirage image has surfaced online
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier today, the Twitter account seen below published the two images depicting a prominent character from Assassin's Creed Mirage
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What we can potentially glean from these images is that the new Assassin's Creed game might feature a quest called "The Forty Thieves." From the depiction of the quest in the new artwork, it seems this is a DLC quest, perhaps even a pre-order bonus for Ubisoft's upcoming game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report also stated that the game would launch sometime between April and June 2023, taking the Assassin's Creed series "back to basics," perhaps straying away from the newfound RPG systems used throughout the past three mainline games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Either way, it could well be the case that both Assassin's Creed Mirage and this new Forty Thieves quest are unveiled by Ubisoft next week
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The company is scheduled to hold a presentation on Saturday, September 10, and it's this event that's been heralded as unveiling the "future of Assassin's Creed." We can hardly think of a more convenient event for Mirage's grand debut.  There's also a rumoured stealth-focused Assassin's Creed spin-off game in the works from Ubisoft, which could be separate from Mirage.  Hirun Cryer is a freelance reporter and writer with Gamesradar+ based out of U.K

                HMD’s Nokia has continued to roll out serviceable but unremarkable smartphones for the last few years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now it’s announced a new subscription plan that it says will “reward users” for keeping their phone for longer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, two devices (and they’re not even the new Nokia phones) will join Circular; The Nokia XR20 will cost £20 (roughly $23) per month with a £30 (around $35) setup fee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also the Nokia T10 LTE, an entry-level 8-inch tablet, for £10 (roughly $12) a month with the same £30 (around $35) setup fee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you return a phone to them, either when you upgrade or leave the service, the company will recycle or refurbish the device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will be longevity incentives for holding onto your Nokia phone for longer too, it’s just not a financial one

            <p>
                HMD’s Nokia has continued to roll out serviceable but unremarkable smartphones for the last few years
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now it’s announced a new subscription plan that it says will “reward users” for keeping their phone for longer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For now, two devices (and they’re not even the new Nokia phones) will join Circular; The Nokia XR20 will cost £20 (roughly $23) per month with a £30 (around $35) setup fee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is also the Nokia T10 LTE, an entry-level 8-inch tablet, for £10 (roughly $12) a month with the same £30 (around $35) setup fee
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When you return a phone to them, either when you upgrade or leave the service, the company will recycle or refurbish the device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will be longevity incentives for holding onto your Nokia phone for longer too, it’s just not a financial one
            </p>

                The spiritual successor to 'Jet Set Radio' is coming next summer Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, a spiritual successor to Sega‘s Jet Set Radio, has been delayed to summer 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The delay was announced by developer Team Reptile yesterday (August 31), with a Twitter statement outlining why the game has been delayed
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In March, Naganuma opened up on his future with Sega, who published Jet Set Radio in 2000
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “I don’t think Sega would hire me again,” shared Naganuma
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The proof is that when I said I was leaving Sega, no one stopped me.” Naganuma went on to say that he doesn’t “miss the old Sega
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today’s Sega is far from the old Sega.” In other gaming news, Square Enix has confirmed that Final Fantasy 16 will not be appearing at the Tokyo Game Show

                Once installed, the current intercom system works as normal, but notifications are also sent to the Ring app, much in the same way as incoming calls from a Ring doorbell

            <p>
                Here, there’s no video, but audio is sent encrypted to the Ring app, letting users answer the intercom from anywhere in the world

                Sony is hosting an event today to unveil a new Xperia smartphone
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Japanese brand hasn't explicitly revealed the name of the new smartphone, but it's likely the Sony Xperia 5 IV
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Sony Xperia 5 IV is rumored to come with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC and sport a triple camera setup on the rear comprising three 12MP units (primary, telephoto, ultrawide)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Xperia 5 IV is expected to feature a 6.1" screen protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and pack a battery bigger than the Xperia 5 III's 4,500 mAh cell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We'll know all about the Sony Xperia 5 IV once the event concludes, so check our homepage for more on the new smartphone

                As highlighted by our reader recently, Maxis postpaid customers are charged RM15 for making or answering a single voice call while travelling overseas
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This exorbitant charge is due to Maxis’ 1 Day Calls and SMS Unlimited Pass, which is activated automatically when you make or receive a call, or after sending more than 3 SMS in a day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This mandatory auto-activation of RM15 per day is only applicable to customers of the current Maxis Postpaid plans while customers on older postpaid as well as Hotlink prepaid and postpaid, are still charged based on pay-per-use, which is more appropriate
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our intention for the unlimited Call & SMS daily pass was for everyone to enjoy worry free unlimited calls and SMS capped at RM15, not just incoming calls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ideally, Maxis should charge users based on their current pay-per-use rate until the total usage reaches a specific threshold
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since postpaid customers are already paying a premium, it would be nice if all telcos provide a decent amount of roaming data and voice minutes for a hassle-free and bill-shock-free experience.

                Rafizi was responding to questions on his reaction to being called up by the police to give his statement following his accusation linking Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Special Functions) Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad to alleged financial misconduct in relation to the RM9 billion LCS procurement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He had earlier asked the police to launch an investigation into the scandal but was met with a counter-complaint filed by an aide of Dr Abdul Latiff, who is also the Mersing MP, yesterday for alleged defamation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi then expressed his concern that this could mean the police might not record Dr Abdul Latiff’s statement or even investigate him in relation to his earlier police report
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He said that if that were to happen, it might give the public the perception that this was because the police are under the Home Ministry whose minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin is in the same party Dr Abdul Latiff
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rafizi said action should be taken as even Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan and PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang had their statements recorded by police recently

                Considering that Lenovo's Tab P12 Pro was one of the only tablets available for the Android 12L developer preview and Android 13 Beta Program, it makes perfect sense to see at least one of Lenovo's latest tablets equipped with the tablet-centric operating system

            <p>
                As for the P11 Pro (2nd Gen), you won't have to wait much longer as Lenovo states the 11.2-inch tablet will be available sometime in September

                As for the P11 Pro (2nd Gen), you won't have to wait much longer as Lenovo states the 11.2-inch tablet will be available sometime in September

            <p>
                Lenovo on Thursday introduced a pair of midrange Android tablets that it hopes will steal market share from Apple's popular iPad

            <p>
                The tablet runs Android 12, and Lenovo promises updates through Android 14
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lenovo doesn't say how much battery life to expect from the 7,700mAh cell
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This slate ships with Android 12L, the tablet-specific version of Android 12, and should eventually get an upgrade to Android 14
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In November 2021, the iPad held about 59% of the market to Android's 41%

                Over the past few weeks, there are a lot of rumours that there could be an iPhone 14 Max model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If case you missed it, it was reported that Apple is getting rid of the iPhone mini lineup to make way for the iPhone 14 Max
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, a new leaked photo says otherwise, showing a different name - iPhone 14 Plus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If that is true, then Apple may keep the Max exclusive for the pro variants, whereas the Plus could be for the non-pro variants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rumours were also consistent that both the alleged iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 14 Pro Max have the exact display measurement of 6.7-inches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Knowing the market in Malaysia, the iPhone 14 Plus could be as popular as the iPhone 14 Pro Max because customers like bigger phones

            <p>
                Over the past few weeks, there are a lot of rumours that there could be an iPhone 14 Max model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If case you missed it, it was reported that Apple is getting rid of the iPhone mini lineup to make way for the iPhone 14 Max
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, a new leaked photo says otherwise, showing a different name - iPhone 14 Plus
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If that is true, then Apple may keep the Max exclusive for the pro variants, whereas the Plus could be for the non-pro variants
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rumours were also consistent that both the alleged iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 14 Pro Max have the exact display measurement of 6.7-inches
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Knowing the market in Malaysia, the iPhone 14 Plus could be as popular as the iPhone 14 Pro Max because customers like bigger phones
            </p>
            
                
                        <p> </p>

                This is how the company “invented” the notch, which is a cutout at the top of the screen where all these sensors, plus a microphone and speaker, are placed

            <p>
                Last year, the company relocated the top speaker of the iPhone 13 to make the notch smaller, but it’s still there
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This new report claims that Apple will make the two separate cutouts on the iPhone 14 Pro’s screen look like a single cutout
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regular iPhone 14 models are expected to keep the same notch as the iPhone 13

                By Dan Coombs  Sergino Dest is set to clinch a move to AC Milan after Manchester United backed away from a potential move

            <p>
                However, The Athletic reported yesterday that United had decided not to move for Dest, electing to keep Aaron Wan-Bissaka as back-up right-back instead

                He says a loan deal with an option to buy is agreed, and Dest is now set to fly to Milan to seal the move

            <p>
                Dest will sign until June 2027, one year loan plus potential four year deal

                It’s unclear whether United decided not to sign Dest simply because they did not want to, or because there was no buyer for Aaron Wan-Bissaka

            <p>
                Back in mid-August a bunch of certifications were issued for the Galaxy Tab Active4 Pro, signifying its imminent launch, and today Samsung has indeed made it official
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It runs Android 12 with Samsung's One UI on top.

                More Samsung Galaxy Tab Active4 Pro official images The Galaxy Tab Active4 Pro and its S Pen are IP68 rated as protected from dust, dirt, and sand, and can withstand being submerged in up to 1.5m of fresh water for up to 30 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Galaxy Tab Active4 Pro will be available "in parts of Europe" in September, Samsung says, with Asia, Latin America, North America, and the Middle East to follow "later in 2022"

                Microsoft said on Wednesday that it recently identified a vulnerability in TikTok's Android app that could allow attackers to hijack accounts when users did nothing more than click on a single errant link
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deeplinks must be declared in an app's manifest for use outside of the app so, for example, someone who clicks on a TikTok link in a browser has the content automatically opened in the TikTok app
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An app can also cryptographically declare the validity of a URL domain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TikTok on Android, for instance, declares the domain m.tiktok.com
            </p>

                Microsoft said on Wednesday that it recently identified a vulnerability in TikTok's Android app that could allow attackers to hijack accounts when users did nothing more than click on a single errant link
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Deeplinks must be declared in an app's manifest for use outside of the app so, for example, someone who clicks on a TikTok link in a browser has the content automatically opened in the TikTok app
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An app can also cryptographically declare the validity of a URL domain
            </p>
            
            <p>
                TikTok on Android, for instance, declares the domain m.tiktok.com

                That can happen," the Liverpool boss said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For a long time, after missing out on their primary target, it seemed like Liverpool were not going to dive into the market, until Klopp's injury crisis got so severe, the Liverpool boss changed his stance and decided he could, in fact, do with another addition

                Sign up to the Liverpool.com newsletter here — it only takes a few seconds! Liverpool's transfer business has often been rightly praised for the club's brilliant recruitment in terms of attracting seemingly tailor-made targets for Klopp's style of play
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even if Liverpool add a midfielder now (which seems highly unlikely, as Klopp said), it will be one out of desperation and not necessarily the right fit

                Elden Ring wasn’t just a hit with fans of FromSoftware’s notoriously difficult action-RPGs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today’s announcement from FromSoft’s parent company Kadokawa revealed that Sony and Tencent are acquiring 14.09% and 16.25% of FromSoft, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement indicates that Kadokawa wants FromSoftware to be able to expand its development efforts; Kadokawa sees the “enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment of [FromSoft] game IP as one of the [Kadokawa] Group’s highest priorities.” One of the aims is to give FromSoft the resources needed to grow Elden Ring into a franchise that extends beyond just video games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elden Ring was a long time coming, built on a foundation first laid down in FromSoftware’s pioneering 2009 PS3 game Demon’s Souls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It owns 5% of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry publisher Ubisoft, completed an acquisition of League of Legends’ developer Riot Games, owns 40% of Epic Games, and has stakes in many, many, many, many other game companies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sony has also been on a spending spree too, though it looks a bit more modest compared to Tencent

            <p>
                Elden Ring wasn’t just a hit with fans of FromSoftware’s notoriously difficult action-RPGs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today’s announcement from FromSoft’s parent company Kadokawa revealed that Sony and Tencent are acquiring 14.09% and 16.25% of FromSoft, respectively
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The statement indicates that Kadokawa wants FromSoftware to be able to expand its development efforts; Kadokawa sees the “enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment of [FromSoft] game IP as one of the [Kadokawa] Group’s highest priorities.” One of the aims is to give FromSoft the resources needed to grow Elden Ring into a franchise that extends beyond just video games
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Elden Ring was a long time coming, built on a foundation first laid down in FromSoftware’s pioneering 2009 PS3 game Demon’s Souls
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It owns 5% of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry publisher Ubisoft, completed an acquisition of League of Legends’ developer Riot Games, owns 40% of Epic Games, and has stakes in many, many, many, many other game companies
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sony has also been on a spending spree too, though it looks a bit more modest compared to Tencent

                @ChanceHMiller The big Apple news of the day is that the iPhone 14 Pro will apparently use software to make the two new display cutouts look like one seamless cutout

                According to a source familiar with Apple’s plans, the company will use this space to make its privacy indicators for the camera and microphone more visible

            <p>
                On the iPhone 14 Pro, Apple will move these indicators and make them far more visible
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will also allow Apple to show both the green and orange dots at the same time when the camera and microphone are both in use

                XDA’s official marketplace for buying and selling tech Premium videos Typically, we would have received a new build of Windows 11 in the Dev channel at this point in the week, but instead, Microsoft is rolling out an update to the Windows Subsystem for Android today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the changes in today’s update aren’t huge, they are welcome
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s a new compatibility shim, which allows apps to be resized while still maintaining their aspect ratio, instead of trying to stretch them to fit the aspect ratio of the window that contains them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still on the topic of compatibility, Microsoft has added some new educative dialog for game controls in games that have compatibility shims enabled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Every other update is fairly minor, though there’s also a new security update for Android, and the Amazon Appstore itself has been updated to version 60.09

                XDA’s official marketplace for buying and selling tech Premium videos Typically, we would have received a new build of Windows 11 in the Dev channel at this point in the week, but instead, Microsoft is rolling out an update to the Windows Subsystem for Android today
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the changes in today’s update aren’t huge, they are welcome
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s a new compatibility shim, which allows apps to be resized while still maintaining their aspect ratio, instead of trying to stretch them to fit the aspect ratio of the window that contains them
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Still on the topic of compatibility, Microsoft has added some new educative dialog for game controls in games that have compatibility shims enabled
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Every other update is fairly minor, though there’s also a new security update for Android, and the Amazon Appstore itself has been updated to version 60.09

                Apple is cutting one iPhone model (the mini) and adding one (the vanilla Max), so a shake-up in the pricing structure is to be expected

            <p>
                Of course, last year there was the iPhone 13 mini for $700 as the cheapest new (non-SE) model
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This year you will be looking to spend $750 or $800 for a new mainline iPhone at the least, if the predictions pan out

            <p>
                Analysts agree that the new iPhone 14 Max will cost $100 more than the vanilla model, which will put its price at $850 or $900, depending on exactly which analysts are right
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is no consensus on whether it’s by $50 or by $100 (TrendForce says $50), but that new hardware doesn’t come cheap
            </p>

                The vanilla iPhone 14 and 14 Max won’t even get the new chipset (if the rumors are to be believed)

                To provide some relief to these gamers, developers often release redeem codes that grant users large quantities of sought-after resources
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This article includes a list of the currently active redeem codes that players can use to get some exceptional rewards
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A list of recently expired popular redeem codes has also been attached below

                They won't be able to collect those rewards at all if they don't correctly redeem the code
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Completing missions, participating in in-game events, effectively using redeem code rewards, and investing large amounts in a smaller number of Cookies than the other way around, is a tried and tested strategy for FTP gamers to compete head-to-head with players who can afford in-app purchases

                It also happens to be the fastest-selling PlayStation console of all time, and it's hard to see how "necessary" this move was, as Ryan puts it.  All in all, it's a terrible look for Sony, especially when it's been getting heat for being less consumer-friendly than Microsoft as of late

                PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst announced that Savage Game Studios would be joining the PlayStation family as a part of its newly created PlayStation Studios Mobile Division

                PlayStation ended up debuting the "PlayStation Games for PC" section of its website shortly after these leaks as well, only adding fuel to the fire.  Will I personally play Sony games on PC? Probably not

                Right now, you can take advantage of a deal at  GameStop,  where the 128GB Quest 2 is only $300, and the 256GB model is available for $400

                It's worth mentioning that Meta is expected to launch a high-end headset (Project Cambria) in the near future, which will likely be quite a bit more expensive than the Quest 2, in case you feel like being patient.

                First announced during CES 2022, Asus has now officially revealed the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED, a giant touchscreen tablet that can be folded down to a 12.5-inch ‘laptop’
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Zenbook 17 Fold OLED will also come with Windows 11 Home out of the box
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another thing worth noting is that, because there’s no actual physical keyboard on the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED, the device comes with the Asus ErgoSense Bluetooth keyboard and touchpad
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Zenbook 17 Fold OLED weighs just 1.5kg without the keyboard, while with the keyboard it weighs 1.8kg
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED will be available in Malaysia by the end of the year, and will be priced at an eye-watering RM14,999
            </p>

                The Reno 8 comes next, with a smaller screen and different processor, and the Reno 8 Light is the most basic model with a lower IP rating and reduced fast charging
            </p>

                The Reno 8 Pro ranks just below Oppo’s flagship Find X5 series, which also includes the Marisilicon X processor

            <p>
                Oppo says the NPU enables 4K video capture in very low light situations that wouldn’t typically be bright enough to allow for recording at that resolution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reno 8 sits just below it with a 6.43-inch screen, a 90Hz refresh rate, and a MediaTek Dimensity 1300 processor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It does not have the Marisilicon NPU, but does offer most of the same features as the 8 Pro, including a 50-megapixel main camera and a 32-megapixel selfie camera
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reno 8 series will go on sale September 1st, with the Reno 8 at £419 (about $488) and the 8 Lite for £319 (about $371)

                The Reno 8 comes next, with a smaller screen and different processor, and the Reno 8 Light is the most basic model with a lower IP rating and reduced fast charging
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reno 8 Pro ranks just below Oppo’s flagship Find X5 series, which also includes the Marisilicon X processor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Oppo says the NPU enables 4K video capture in very low light situations that wouldn’t typically be bright enough to allow for recording at that resolution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reno 8 sits just below it with a 6.43-inch screen, a 90Hz refresh rate, and a MediaTek Dimensity 1300 processor
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It does not have the Marisilicon NPU, but does offer most of the same features as the 8 Pro, including a 50-megapixel main camera and a 32-megapixel selfie camera
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Reno 8 series will go on sale September 1st, with the Reno 8 at £419 (about $488) and the 8 Lite for £319 (about $371)

                The aluminum “wings” are also extendable so that, according to Bang & Olufsen, almost any TV can be slotted into the Beosound Theatre

                VIVE is holding a UK sales event until September 11 where you can save £100 on the Cosmos Elite VR headset, and save more on other models too
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Readers in the UK can save £100 on the VIVE Cosmos Elite VR headset when you grab it from VIVE's website until September 11.  Right now, you can get the HTC VIVE Cosmos Elite VR headset for just £349 (opens in new tab), down from the usual price of £449
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As VR headset deals go, this one is pretty solid.  While this deal is for the headset only, the VIVE Cosmos Elite is hailed as one of the most customizable and compatible models on the market
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There's also a host of other great deals (opens in new tab) on VIVE's website which will be highlighted below.  VIVE Cosmos Elite VR Headset Was £449 now £349 on VIVE (opens in new tab).  Save £100 on a VR headset that features in our best VR headset guide
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If that wasn't enough for you, you also get two months of Viveport Infinity membership included with the headset.  But, this is a sales event that VIVE are offering so to have just one headset discounted wouldn't be enough
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can also enjoy £100 off the VIVE Cosmos (opens in new tab), the VIVE Pro headset (opens in new tab) and the VIVE Pro Full Kit (opens in new tab)

                The national 5G company, Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) has confirmed that there were indeed some last-minute changes to its shareholder agreement that was supposed to involve six local telcos
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The report further added that Maxis and U Mobile did not see any benefits in having stakes in the national 5G company although both telcos apparently still want to obtain 5G access from DNB
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DNB generally confirmed this through its media statement [pdf] which said that one of the six telcos decided not to proceed with the shareholder agreement while another choose not to respond even though they have earlier confirmed their participation in the agreement
            </p>
            
            <p>

            <p>
                The company also clarified that telcos don’t have to take up any equity in DNB for them to sign up for 5G access

                The feature is far from perfect and won’t replace the quality of a physical green screen, but we can attest that it does a decent job

            <p>
                Previously, it was possible to use a virtual green screen in OBS via plugins, but Nvidia Broadcast will make the feature much more accessible

            <p>
                Those who use an Nvidia RTX graphics card could probably already have the software installed, and Nvidia Broadcast also integrates with lots of popular streaming hardware and applications
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, Corsair integrated Nvidia Broadcast tools into its iCue and Elgato software back in July 2022, allowing those who rely on Corsair or Elgato hardware to utilize certain features such as its impressive background noise suppression

                The Elgato Camera Hub also got access to Virtual Backgrounds at this time, allowing streamers to access Nvidia Broadcast tools without going to the app directly

            <p>
                Virtual Backgrounds is the only Nvidia -specific feature added to the latest version of OBS (version 28.0) but there are other non-Nvidia Broadcast features coming to the service, such as support for high-efficiency video coding (HEVC or H.265) and high-dynamic range (HDR)

                But VGC sources suggest the reveal is unlikely to be related to its biggest classic franchises Konami will announce a new game related to a classic series during next month’s Tokyo Game Show, it’s said
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Voice actor Yuji Kaji will be invited as a guest to represent the fans of a series which is loved all over the world, on the announcement stage for a new Konami title,” it reads
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, as he’s seemingly only “representing the fans” of the new game in question, this doesn’t necessarily mean the new title will be related to anything he’s previously starred in
            </p>

                That list just got a little longer, with Dell confirming (via The Verge) (opens in new tab) there is a screen issue on some OLED models
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This issue has the screen seemingly coming off the laptop
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Dell also claims the problem is specific to the OLED version of the XPS 13 Plus, with non-OLED versions seemingly unaffected.  If you’ve purchased a Dell XPS 13 Plus OLED already, be sure to keep an eye on the screen for any potential problems

                Barcelona striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang suffered a broken jaw during a robbery at his house earlier in the week, sources confirmed to ESPN
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aubameyang was assaulted in the early hours of Monday morning when a gang broke into his home equipped with firearms and iron bars
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But sources have now confirmed to ESPN that the former Arsenal striker did break his jaw during the break-in and will be out for around three weeks, which could have implications on a proposed move to Chelsea
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The injury to Aubameyang's jaw has slightly changed the negotiations, however, with a loan to the west London club emerging as a possible solution
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Barca coach Xavi Hernandez is happy to keep Aubameyang, but the club's need to reduce their wage bill to fund other business before the transfer window closes this week has forced them to listen to offers

                Harry Maguire has not been at his best for the past few seasons at Manchester United, and Cristiano Ronaldo told the club management that he needed to be 'demoted' as a result Cristiano Ronaldo approached former Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick last season to call for Harry Maguire to be dropped

                Joseph Schooling became Hugo Boss' first Singaporean ambassador in 2018

            <p>
                Schooling, 27, became the brand's first Singaporean ambassador in 2018

            <p>
                I will make amends and right what is wrong

            <p>
                In 2018, Toyota distributor Borneo Motors struck a three-year deal with Schooling to be its brand ambassador

                You can have a look at the September 2022 PlayStation Plus Essential Games right now, as Billbil-kun has now leaked the catalog for the free games for the month
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While they are a little late, they are still ahead of the official Sony account from tweeting this news, so it does mean we won’t have to wait long for an official announcement
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is an okay month when compared to August 2022, which was a far superior month for the catalog and offered a lot of better titles for the program

            <p>
                The posters featured artworks from both SNK and Capcom games, which fueled the excitement of fans, and gave a clear message to the developers that SNK vs Capcom shouldn’t only be viewed from the angle of nostalgia

                The two tech giants now own a combined 30% of the studio Sony and Chinese publishing giant Tencent are both set to increase their stake in Elden Ring and Dark Souls developer FromSoftware
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an announcement this morning, FromSoft parent company Kadokawa Corporation - which remains the majority owner of the developer - confirmed that Sony now owns 14.09% of FromSoftware
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond that, attention is likely to turn to Elden Ring - as well as hopes for upcoming Elden Ring DLC, FromSoftware and publisher Bando Namcai have discussed their desire for the title to act as the start of a new franchise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the future of Elden Ring seems in a better space than its more gothic older brother, it's far from clear at this point what we can expect from the deal, and Kadokawa Corporation suggests that the deal's impact on its 2023 financial results is likely to be "minor." This list of new games 2022 should prove a more reliable wishlist

                The two tech giants now own a combined 30% of the studio Sony and Chinese publishing giant Tencent are both set to increase their stake in Elden Ring and Dark Souls developer FromSoftware
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In an announcement this morning, FromSoft parent company Kadokawa Corporation - which remains the majority owner of the developer - confirmed that Sony now owns 14.09% of FromSoftware
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond that, attention is likely to turn to Elden Ring - as well as hopes for upcoming Elden Ring DLC, FromSoftware and publisher Bando Namcai have discussed their desire for the title to act as the start of a new franchise
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While the future of Elden Ring seems in a better space than its more gothic older brother, it's far from clear at this point what we can expect from the deal, and Kadokawa Corporation suggests that the deal's impact on its 2023 financial results is likely to be "minor." This list of new games 2022 should prove a more reliable wishlist

                There is no denying that looking at the durability tests of a device can be a painful endeavor, especially when the device does not survive
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, at the same time, we have to admit the fact that a durability test does not always represent the real-life usage of that device in question because, more often than not, you are looking at the tester taking the device to an extreme measure that we certainly will not take
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can look at the test below and see how the Galaxy Z Fold 4 handles it
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For a device this expensive, you would expect the durability to be good
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, it is worth noting that a foldable device is generally way more fragile than a standard phone, but seeing the Galaxy Z Fold 4 survive the test and pass with flying colors inspires a lot of confidence in the foldable device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After all, why would you put your device through sand and debris, right? With that said, if you are planning on getting your hands on the Galaxy Z Fold 4 but are afraid that the device itself is not durable enough, this should be more than enough for you to know that getting this phone is not going to be a problem

                From lossless audio support to fitness tracking, these are the big upgrades we hope to see on the AirPods Pro 2 Apple's AirPods Pro 2 could well be one of the stars of the Apple September Event that's now confirmed for September 7

            <p>
                While some people will be most excited about possible changes to the AirPods Pro 2's design, that's not how I roll.  As I'm a quality-audio enthusiast, the most exciting feature I'd like to see on the AirPods Pro 2's spec sheet is support for Apple's own ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) format
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, a patent, spotted by Patently Apple (opens in new tab), could enable the AirPods to overcome that problem by instead using optical audio transmission tech.  Regardless of what happens there, the AirPods Pro 2 have been tipped to come with Bluetooth LE Audio support

            <p>
                Any ANC improvement on the new model would be welcome
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This was first hinted at in a 2020 Apple patent, and the AirPods Pro 2 could potentially be the first to harness a new chip with more sophisticated smart processing to enable this functionality
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The current AirPods Pro manage around 4.5 hours of playback time, but the AirPods 3 can get to 6 hours playback from a single charge — albeit without ANC

                AMD is rumored to launch three new Zen 4 V-Cache CPUs, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, Ryzen 9 7900X3D & Ryzen 7 7800X3D at CES 2023
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The latest rumor regarding the Zen 4 V-Cache parts comes from Greymon55 who has put forward a cryptic tweet referring to the Ryzen 7000 3D V-Cache CPUs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to the tweet, three Ryzen 3D V-Cache CPUs have been rumored, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, Ryzen 9 7900X3D & the Ryzen 7 7800X3D
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We can't say for sure yet if AMD will have a single CCD stacked with a 3D cache stack or if both Zen 4 CCDs will be stacked
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In any case, if AMD goes with the existing 64 MB SRAM (3D V-Cache) stack, we will get up to 104 MB cache on the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, up to 140 MB cache on the Ryzen 9 7900X3D, and a whopping 144 MB of cache on the Ryzen 9 7950X3D
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That's a 2.6x increase over Ryzen 7 7700X, an 85% increase over the 7900X, and an 80% increase over the Ryzen 9 7950X

                As for other Android devices, they will only receive the update “later this year”, though many companies have already started rolling out Android 13 beta versions for their smartphones to customers, including Samsung with its popular Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S21 Series.  In fact, the Galaxy S22 Series had actually received Android 13 via One UI 5.0 beta even before Google officially released the final version of Android 13
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Well, it does make sense given how Android 13 beta has been around for ages and the One UI 5.0 is not utilising the final version of the latest Android OS.   Now, Samsung is rolling out the One UI 5.0 beta to the Galaxy S22 Series’ predecessor, the Galaxy S21 Series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Available for download for Galaxy S21 Series users in South Korea and the United Kingdom, the update carries the firmware version G99xBxxU5ZVHE according to SamMobile.  Moreover, the 1957.47MB update is available for all unlocked models of the Galaxy S21 Series which include the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+ and Galaxy S21 Ultra
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Well, if you’re a Samsung Galaxy S22 or Galaxy S21 user and are interested to test the Android 13 beta when it’s available in Malaysia, make sure to install the Samsung Members app on your device and log in to the app using your Samsung account

                Here are 3 simple reasons to pick the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G as your next flagship device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The recently launched Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra not only packed in a built-in S Pen, it also comes with the highest-end camera specs of the entire Samsung Galaxy S22 series so it’s safe to assume that the S22 Ultra is every bit a super cameraphone as it’s S21 Ultra predecessor

                Well, it does make sense given how Android 13 beta has been around for ages and the One UI 5.0 is not utilising the final version of the latest Android OS.   Now, Samsung is rolling out the One UI 5.0 beta to the Galaxy S22 Series’ predecessor, the Galaxy S21 Series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Available for download for Galaxy S21 Series users in South Korea and the United Kingdom, the update carries the firmware version G99xBxxU5ZVHE according to SamMobile.  Moreover, the 1957.47MB update is available for all unlocked models of the Galaxy S21 Series which include the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+ and Galaxy S21 Ultra
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Well, if you’re a Samsung Galaxy S22 or Galaxy S21 user and are interested to test the Android 13 beta when it’s available in Malaysia, make sure to install the Samsung Members app on your device and log in to the app using your Samsung account
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here are 3 simple reasons to pick the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G as your next flagship device
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The recently launched Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra not only packed in a built-in S Pen, it also comes with the highest-end camera specs of the entire Samsung Galaxy S22 series so it’s safe to assume that the S22 Ultra is every bit a super cameraphone as it’s S21 Ultra predecessor

                New findings by 9to5Google suggest that the new Google Pixel 7 series (and future Pixel 7a) may support a new Bluetooth codec

                Android 13 brought support for ‘Bluetooth LE Audio’ using the LC3 codec
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This exchange infers that the new Bluetooth LE Audio feature will be supported by the new Pixel phones
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The LC3 audio codec will be able to compress audio more efficiently and it can be configured to use more or less bandwidth such as when there’s suddenly a longer distance between the host device and connected audio
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, for any regular consumer to be able to take advantage of this new codec, both the Android smartphone and audio device must support the same codec

                Paris Saint-Germain have signed central midfielder Fabian Ruiz from Italian side Napoli with the Spain international signing a five-year contract, the Ligue 1 club said on Tuesday

                - Storylines to watch ahead of transfer deadline day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I spoke with Leandro after training
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He is currently a PSG player but his head is elsewhere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I took the decision not to put him in the squad so that he could prepare his departure and I could not have a player who, perhaps, perhaps will leave the club." Galtier also did not rule out a move for Inter Milan defender Milan Skriniar ahead of Thursday's transfer deadline
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Obviously Milan has been a player that has been targeted for a long time, it seems difficult because the negotiations are very difficult with Inter Milan, but we must also respect the decision of Inter Milan, and as I said before there are more than 48 hours before the closing and everything is possible." Ruiz is PSG's sixth signing since the close season after midfielders Vitinha and Renato Sanches, defenders Nuno Mendes and Nordi Mukiele, and forward Hugo Ekitike
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PSG are top of Ligue 1 with 10 points and next play Toulouse on Wednesday.

                Paris Saint-Germain have signed central midfielder Fabian Ruiz from Italian side Napoli with the Spain international signing a five-year contract, the Ligue 1 club said on Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                - Storylines to watch ahead of transfer deadline day
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "I spoke with Leandro after training
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "He is currently a PSG player but his head is elsewhere
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I took the decision not to put him in the squad so that he could prepare his departure and I could not have a player who, perhaps, perhaps will leave the club." Galtier also did not rule out a move for Inter Milan defender Milan Skriniar ahead of Thursday's transfer deadline
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Obviously Milan has been a player that has been targeted for a long time, it seems difficult because the negotiations are very difficult with Inter Milan, but we must also respect the decision of Inter Milan, and as I said before there are more than 48 hours before the closing and everything is possible." Ruiz is PSG's sixth signing since the close season after midfielders Vitinha and Renato Sanches, defenders Nuno Mendes and Nordi Mukiele, and forward Hugo Ekitike
            </p>
            
            <p>
                PSG are top of Ligue 1 with 10 points and next play Toulouse on Wednesday.

                Steven Gerrard has come under the spotlight following Aston Villa’s difficult start to their campaign
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Arteta confirmed they are not in contention for Villa, although Zinchenko could be back for the Manchester United clash at the weekend
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Aston Villa manager suggested he had partial training but could have an entire session on Tuesday
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Leon Bailey could also come in on the right side of the attack, with Coutinho on the left
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Against Villa, there will be another test for Gabriel against the likes of Watkins and Coutinho

            </p>
            
            <p>
                After numerous attempts at breaking the duck for their first international title, Aaron-Wooi Yik came good in Tokyo last week where they dropped just one game (against India’s Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty in the semi-finals) en route to the title
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Once you are a champion, everyone will start analysing your game and we have to raise our game to face the challenges ahead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wooi Yik added that playing in a major final and winning it has helped boost their confidence tremendously which will help them achieve more honours
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We’ve been playing for almost four years as partners and sometimes, we think like it is impossible to become champions,” said Wooi Yik
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We will just keep learning and focus on our strengths.” Aaron-Wooi Yik are bracing for a storm of challenges that would come their way with renewed confidence, something that was missing in their career.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                After numerous attempts at breaking the duck for their first international title, Aaron-Wooi Yik came good in Tokyo last week where they dropped just one game (against India’s Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty in the semi-finals) en route to the title
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “Once you are a champion, everyone will start analysing your game and we have to raise our game to face the challenges ahead
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Wooi Yik added that playing in a major final and winning it has helped boost their confidence tremendously which will help them achieve more honours
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We’ve been playing for almost four years as partners and sometimes, we think like it is impossible to become champions,” said Wooi Yik
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “We will just keep learning and focus on our strengths.” Aaron-Wooi Yik are bracing for a storm of challenges that would come their way with renewed confidence, something that was missing in their career.

                Samsung Android Firmware Updates Beta
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Earlier this month, Samsung opened up the public beta for One UI 5 based on Android 13 for the Galaxy S22 series, and today this is now also jumping to the Galaxy S21 devices
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So far, the beta program seems to have been started for these in Korea and the UK
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you're in the UK and want to try your hand at this, note that the beta is currently only available for SIM-free, unlocked units
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will definitely be a bunch of further beta builds for One UI 5.0, and if you're registered into the testing program you'll receive each of those as it's released, as an over-the-air update

                Liverpool are said to be keeping tabs on Benfica’s new signing Enzo Fernandez, according to Melissa Reddy, amid their ongoing pursuit of a new midfielder this summer

            <p>
                A new signing has yet to emerge late in the window despite the club’s ongoing attempts to address an injury crisis in the middle of the park

                When Android 13 first started rolling out a few weeks ago, it was discovered that users wouldn’t be able to go back to Android 12 after updating
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, Google is allowing some Pixel owners to go back to Android 12

                According to Android Central, Google is now correcting that mistake by releasing “Developer Support images” that will allow its Pixel 6 devices to safely downgrade to an image of Android 12 or 12L

            <p>
                On Google’s developer site, the company explains Pixel 6 devices can be rolled back to an Android 12 Developer Support image, but can’t be rolled back to any other Android 12 images

                This is precisely Antony's game

                The winger has been a target for Ten Hag all summer
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, how will Antony add to what United already have and why was Ten Hag so desperate to sign the 22-year-old Brazilian? Building a better culture Ten Hag is turning around the culture at Manchester United
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the match, Ten Hag put the problem down to a lack of team spirit
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is precisely Antony's game
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And Antony is seriously quick
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But it is not all about the stats for Ten Hag

                Samsung is on a roll with the One UI 5 (Android 13) beta program
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's only been a few weeks since Samsung launched the One UI 5 (Android 13) beta for its flagship Galaxy S22 series
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's expected that there shouldn't be much difference in software between the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S22, so users can likely expect a similar experience
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Keep in mind that this is beta software, so there are likely to be bugs
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Stable Android 13 is expected to start arriving on Galaxy smartphones later this year, but until then, we expect Samsung will expand its beta program to more of its best Android phones in the coming weeks

                @joseadorno In a week from now, alongside the new iPhone 14 series, Apple will announce the new Apple Watch Series 8

                In a thread, ShrimpApplePro posted that the Apple Watch Series 8 will include a refreshed shade of red
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This will also apply for the iPhone boxes Apple leaker also says stocks “…are going well, so I’m assuming there will be little to no shipping delay when ordering it [the Apple Watch Series 8].” For those expecting changes on the box, it will be the same as the Apple Watch Series 7, meaning it will feature a band and a USB-C to MagSafe cable to charge the Apple Watch
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although Shrimp doesn’t talk about that, one of the main features of this upcoming Watch is a new body-temperature sensor, which will also be available with the rumored Apple Watch Pro

                @ChanceHMiller While there is quite a bit we already know about the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro, new details are emerging as we approach Apple’s September 7 event
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With that in mind, it seems the only change for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max will be the addition of the new purple color
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, the source says that we can expect the same graphite, silver, and gold color options as the iPhone 13 Pro
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Speaking of that MagSafe Battery Pack, Apple is also reportedly planning a new MagSafe battery accessory that will be “exclusive” to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro; more details on this are unclear as of now
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In terms of storage, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will both still start with 128GB of storage according to this leak
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max will use the same A15 chip as the iPhone 13, as previously reported by 9to5Mac.

                Players who participate in a new limited-time event will reveal a "hint" about the future of Diablo Immortal
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As outlined in a new blog post, one of those events, the Mists of Cyrangar, will see players taking on "unspeakable horrors" that "lie shrouded in the mist." As players progress the event, Blizzard says mist from the game's event page will slowly clear, revealing a "hint" about Diablo Immortal's first major update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the event, all players who are below their server's Paragon level will receive bonus experience until the event ends or they catch up, with Blizzard in the patch notes writing it wants to provide players with an opportunity to "catch up" in preparation for the game's first major update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What that update will entail is still a mystery for now, but Blizzard has stated in the past that Diablo Immortal's "major updates" will introduce new gameplay features, events, and expand on the game's story
            </p>

                Diablo Immortal proved controversial upon release for its various microtransactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The game has reportedly earned more than $100 million since launch, with Blizzard president Mike Ybarra defending Diablo Immortal's monetization model in a recent interview

            </p>
            
            <p>
                During the event, all players who are below their server's Paragon level will receive bonus experience until the event ends or they catch up, with Blizzard in the patch notes writing it wants to provide players with an opportunity to "catch up" in preparation for the game's first major update
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What that update will entail is still a mystery for now, but Blizzard has stated in the past that Diablo Immortal's "major updates" will introduce new gameplay features, events, and expand on the game's story
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Diablo Immortal proved controversial upon release for its various microtransactions
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The game has reportedly earned more than $100 million since launch, with Blizzard president Mike Ybarra defending Diablo Immortal's monetization model in a recent interview

            <p>
                A video has been circulating for weeks now of an XPS 13 Plus’ screen falling off in a Best Buy demo area (the video is incorrectly labeled as being of the larger XPS 15)

            <p>
                Dell is proactively reaching out to customers who may be impacted to replace the screen, ideally before it becomes loose
            </p>

                Dell also noted that the problem is specific to OLED XPS 13 Plus models — non-OLED models, it seems, are not impacted

                In a torture test putting the Galaxy Z Fold 4 through the worst of the worst, it holds up well to dust and dirt, but that’s not really a surprise.

            <p>
                The Galaxy Z Fold 4 has the same IPX8 rating as its predecessor, meaning it has strong resistance to water, but no protection against dust

                8BitDo’s older controllers like the SN30 Pro and Pro 2 have boasted a broad array of compatibility options thanks to their Bluetooth connectivity, but the Ultimate Controller will be available in three different configurations — Bluetooth ($69.99), 2.4Ghz ($49.99), or wired ($34.99) — based on your preferred console and connectivity method.

                One of our few complaints is the controller’s symmetrical side-by-side joystick layout, which 8BitDo is finally addressing with a new version of its Xbox Ultimate wired controller that also finally goes wireless
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That makes its use of side-by-side analog joysticks a bit confusing, because Nintendo has been using an asymmetrical joystick layout since the GameCube WaveBird, and continues to use it on its Joy-Cons and Pro Controller

            <p>
                Sure, the Wii U Pro Controller uses a symmetrical layout, but the stick placement on the 8BitDo Pro 2 is more like a Dualshock’s than that controller’s

            <p>
                It offers all the same features and functionality of 8BitDo’s wired Xbox controller and the wireless Pro 2, including compatibility with special software and apps for configuring the controller, the ability to store and easily switch between three different configuration profiles, and an extra pair of re-mappable paddle buttons on the back
            </p>

                They won’t replace the wireless 8BitDo Pro 2 controller, however, as that controller’s side-by-side joystick layout will still appeal to some gamers.

                You can add up to eight apps to the bottom row.  If you don't want to have your most recent apps cycling through on the right side of the taskbar, you can get rid of it by opening the Settings app on your Z Fold 4 and going to Display > Taskbar and and sliding the switch next to Show recent apps to the Off position
            </p>

                When you're in an app and want to switch to another app that's in your taskbar, you can do so just by tapping on the app's icon

            <p>
                You can use two apps in split-screen view, or drag a third app onto the display to use three apps at the same time.  Even with the Fold 4's large display, three apps on the screen do get a bit cramped

                Just two days short of the decision in the solar hybrid case, the High Court allowed a preliminary objection raised by the Attorney General's Chambers (AGC) in Rosmah's application for leave to commence judicial review in her attempt to remove Sri Ram

            <p>
                On Sept 24, 2021, High Court judge Justice Mohamed Zaini Mazlan, the presiding judge in Rosmah's solar hybrid trial, dismissed Rosmah's application to disqualify Sri Ram
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosmah appealed the decision but it was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on Dec 6, 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 27, the Federal Court ruled that Sri Ram was qualified to prosecute Rosmah in the solar hybrid project trial
            </p>

            <p>
                Just two days short of the decision in the solar hybrid case, the High Court allowed a preliminary objection raised by the Attorney General's Chambers (AGC) in Rosmah's application for leave to commence judicial review in her attempt to remove Sri Ram
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "This court has no jurisdiction to grant leave to hear the substantive judicial review application
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On Sept 24, 2021, High Court judge Justice Mohamed Zaini Mazlan, the presiding judge in Rosmah's solar hybrid trial, dismissed Rosmah's application to disqualify Sri Ram
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rosmah appealed the decision but it was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on Dec 6, 2021
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On May 27, the Federal Court ruled that Sri Ram was qualified to prosecute Rosmah in the solar hybrid project trial

                The 20-year-old, who was a £4.5m signing from Independiente in February 2021, has caught plenty of attention after impressing under Graham Potter this season
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Caicedo has been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, but Potter is confident he will remain on the south coast beyond Thursday's transfer deadline and insisted any potential suitors will need to break the bank to sign the midfielder.  Brighton boss Graham Potter (right) insists any potential suitors for Moises Caicedo (left) will need to break the bank to sign him this window Reports of a £42m bid for Caicedo was relayed back to Potter in his Monday press conference and was asked if it would be enough to part ways with the midfielder
            </p>
            
            <p>
                'As soon as you do research on him you realise he is a top kid, great person, young, playing in the Premier League, has all the attributes to play at the very, very highest level.' Caicedo's value has soared since joining the Seagulls for £4.5m from Ecuadorian side Independiente del Valle in February 2021

                That is how it is, but we are quite calm and confident.'   Saturday's 1-0 win against Leeds at the Amex Stadium lifted them level to 10 points with second-placed Manchester City and Tottenham, but Potter is paying little attention to their lofty position

            <p>
                Liverpool were said to be one of the club's interested in Caicedo, given their growing injury list 'Ten points from four games is a great return and we're happy with that, but we need to stay calm and keep doing our best.' Potter will hand a late fitness test to Joel Veltman before the game at Craven Cottage

                Spray cans at the ready The Pokemon Company is teasing something new for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and fans think they've already figured out what is might be.  Yesterday on August 29, the official Pokemon Twitter account tweeted out the strange set of images just below
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As you can see below, one eagle-eyed Twitter user, thinks that a trainer who appeared in a previous trailer for Scarlet and Violet will use this new Pokemon - whatever it ends up being - due to the person holding a spray can
            </p>
            
            <p>
                it seems likely that this trainer used the aiai pokemon as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That typing doesn't currently exist in Pokemon, which would make the new arrival an interesting specimen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Again, it's worth remembering Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are intentionally based in a region styled off Spain, so this theory that the new artwork represents Ibarrola's Oma Forest exhibition is very likely
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pokemon Scarlet and Violet launch later this year on November 18 for the Nintendo Switch

                Spray cans at the ready The Pokemon Company is teasing something new for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and fans think they've already figured out what is might be.  Yesterday on August 29, the official Pokemon Twitter account tweeted out the strange set of images just below
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As you can see below, one eagle-eyed Twitter user, thinks that a trainer who appeared in a previous trailer for Scarlet and Violet will use this new Pokemon - whatever it ends up being - due to the person holding a spray can
            </p>
            
            <p>
                it seems likely that this trainer used the aiai pokemon as well
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That typing doesn't currently exist in Pokemon, which would make the new arrival an interesting specimen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Again, it's worth remembering Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are intentionally based in a region styled off Spain, so this theory that the new artwork represents Ibarrola's Oma Forest exhibition is very likely
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Pokemon Scarlet and Violet launch later this year on November 18 for the Nintendo Switch
            </p>

                The foldable from Google has been named the Pixel Notepad although, leaks and rumours have referred to it as the Pixel Fold

            <p>
                According to the patent, the flexible screen’s bezel will have a camera with a moving aperture, which, may be the first of its kind in a foldable device.  On August 5, a leak surfaced which disclosed that the Google Pixel folding screen projector will resemble the OPPO Find N from the front and the Google Pixel 7 from the rear.  The device will be relatively compact with a huge screen that folds inward horizontally and will have a complete screen without holes on the inner screen, along with a micro-perforated camera on the inner screen bezel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The outer screen will have a single hole in the middle.  As per previous leaks, the Google Pixel Notepad foldable is supposed to have a short and broad body and a 5.8-inch external screen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Pixel Notepad was reportedly going to have a 7.58-inch main display which would be manufactured by Samsung Display
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although this would make the Pixel Fold substantially more expensive than the cheapest Pixel 6, as well as Pixel 7, it would still be about $400 cheaper than the cheapest Galaxy Z Fold 3 & the Galaxy Z Flip 3

                According to the patent, the flexible screen’s bezel will have a camera with a moving aperture, which, may be the first of its kind in a foldable device.  On August 5, a leak surfaced which disclosed that the Google Pixel folding screen projector will resemble the OPPO Find N from the front and the Google Pixel 7 from the rear.  The device will be relatively compact with a huge screen that folds inward horizontally and will have a complete screen without holes on the inner screen, along with a micro-perforated camera on the inner screen bezel
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The outer screen will have a single hole in the middle.  As per previous leaks, the Google Pixel Notepad foldable is supposed to have a short and broad body and a 5.8-inch external screen
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Pixel Notepad was reportedly going to have a 7.58-inch main display which would be manufactured by Samsung Display
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although this would make the Pixel Fold substantially more expensive than the cheapest Pixel 6, as well as Pixel 7, it would still be about $400 cheaper than the cheapest Galaxy Z Fold 3 & the Galaxy Z Flip 3

                The iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max will reportedly feature new ultrawide camera sensors that can capture 1.4µm pixels
            </p>

                It was reported last Thursday (Aug 25) that five people, including a 14-year-old girl, were detained to assist investigations into the kidnapping of a nine-month-old baby girl, at an apartment in Bukit Tengah here last Tuesday (Aug 23)

                When the baby's 24-year-old mother went to pick up her daughter about 5.30pm last Tuesday (Aug 23), she was told by the nanny that the baby was taken by the teen girl when she was performing prayers
